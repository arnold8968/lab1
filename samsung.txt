review_text this phone hold up to other smart phone it may not have all the latest features but this phone is great i mainly purchased this phone again for my gear vr  it works perfect in the vr system phone is horrible battery dies super fast for no reason only using this piece of junk for work and half the time i use my personal iphone its worthless i dont like the invasiveness of samsung with the s10  i decided on a s10 not samsung its harder to use cant pair it i chose the s10 i wouldnt recommend this to an casual user or a sr citizen too difficult to navigate and too difficult to use going from an s7 to the s10 i dont use much of the technology so i cant speak to features   there is no msg indicator light that blinks when you receive a text or vm msg which is an inconvenience   i also struggle to get the screen to wake up after it goes dark   otherwise the phone works fine i used my plan insurance to replace my old s7 that quit working i was told i would get a brand new s7 which maybe it is but i still have all the issues my old s7 developed over time it is slow it overheats constantly if i do more than send an occasional text and wont hold a charge for very long ive only had this new s7 for 3 weeks i hate it it overheats takes forever to charge dropped once and front and back cracked opens random apps takes a long tie to open correct apps my s4 was much better pics dont always save i am a dedicated samsung consumer  i am very satisfied so far with my new galaxy s7 edge i have had samsung cellular phones before up till now the s7active was the marvel tough gritty well designed and put together and i almost miss it my brother passed on his nearnew s8 one day i dropped it small fractures spider webbed from the top cornerlater i dropped it cracked the screen third time no bueno then i discovered the used market and found an s7 what a phone just like the s7active but without the rubber baby buggy bumpers to protect it the otter box folks with there version of the rbbb  Samsung technology is on the cutting edge and my S7 is the best phone I have owned to dateI am happy I just hope Samsung keep delivering the updates cause that would be a deal breaker I got this phone and I loved it But about 1 month in I noticed that the battery life is undesirable It lasts 8 hours on normal brightness and off For me to get a full days use out of it I needed to shut it off and have it as minimum brightness Overall a good phone just requires battery precautions I have had it for a while and am no hurry to upgrade Its battery drains quickly when I am not at home I misplaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and fortunately I had insurance on it It was replaced with the S7 the very night that I reported it missing Two technical people arrived at my home to assist with the setup of the new phone and I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use Love all the features it has The battery sucks  this is my 3rd time replacing  Has not pulled through for me when I needed it  Very annoying when you need to take pics or make a text or call and it takes 30 miutes to even get a charge  I cant fit too many apps on the phone or it slows down the phone a lot everything on this phone works great for a while  then the selfie camera randomly quits  you get an error message and the camera closes  this is the 2nd Samsung phone Ive had with the same problem  Despite a complete factory reset and 9 hours on my day off work wasted the camera still doesnt work  I have no doubt Samsung knows about this problem yet they dont fix it Ive gone through 3 S7s in the past 2 weeks
Im hoping my next call will result in a much better quality phone Very disappointed with the overheating and lag Very pleased with this newer phone  Had a simpler samsung and did not like that so upgraded  More memory faster sleeker and was in my price range   I refuse to spend up to a thousand dollars on a phone  I also wanted to own it outright and not have payments on a phone  Very pleased The phone gets super hot Its nice and pretty and sleek But its slow  i dont know why it gets so hot The screen is small I just hate it Purchased at Walmart  Great price and I effectively got rid of the Amazon Fire This had everything i used already on it Sometimes it doesnt keep the Wifi connection  and this happened a few times but it seems to have resolved Pleased otherwise Piece of garbage and that includes the Note 9 we just bought I will be going to Apple products for now on if I have to overpay for garbage products might as well be apple Got this as a replacement for damaged phone I dont like it as well My phone slid out of my hand on to a cushioned felt covered table and the back shattered the day after I received it I have dropped phones and nothing has happened to them It also is constantly over heating My SMG935A why dont update to oreo version phone This phone show me alredy up to date not a good performance Since getting this phone advertisements pop up in several places Sometimes they pop up full screen just as Im about to tap the screen for something else and that opens the add

The phone is sluggish and sometimes the screen seems unresponsive Ill never get a Samsung again My girlfriends phone is the same way but not as sluggish so it delivers you advertising faster Maybe the adds are an Android problem and Samsung is simply sluggish I would like to know Ill stick with iPhones from now on So happy with my Galaxy Edges photo clarity Im amazed The images are beautiful Battery life over the past year or so has dwindled somewhat but really not too much I have no regrets with this phone My S5 active was stolen Decided to get an S7 Edge The 7 wanted to do updates every 15 to 20 minutes so I returned it and bought a new S5 The S5 refuses sometimes over and over to send a text even if you just received some until you shut the phone off and restart then the text goes right through ISSUES You can do much more with this phone then you can an iPhone Runs smooth great speaker great mic AMAZING camera great control panel All these things have made me decide to stick to Samsung devices Ive had Galaxy phones since the note 4 which I prefer  The 7 was a replacement and though still a good phone it freezes a lot  A lot of times when I press links it does not respond at all I bought this phone some two years ago  and I have never regretted it Then my husband  wanted  one so now we both have  them and we love easy of using it I tried to use an I phone but felt like I have blliders on my eye side like a horse especially after testing the freedom of Samsung My phone is a new referbished G7 from Verizon Got 2 of them and both have the same problems They freeze alot and are very slow Wish they would do a better job in inspecting new referbished products at verizon Quality control seems out the window I had been do an upgrade for several months I didnt want because some changes are so evident  Alas my s6 died I had to get the S7 upgrade  It was amazing  I did not lose anything while switching over  I have everything from the S6 to the S7   Absolutely perfect  LOVEIT With a case it breaks and its not waterproof Its glitchy and its only been a couple months and I have the black screen of death with glitches This is the fifth phone Ive had in less than one year I dont get notifications all the time I get incorrect notifications I get sound with notifications sometimes I get I get notifications without sound It gets hot It tells me its shutting down an application The phone is not even warm When it gets really hot I dont get a notification at all changed phones from the original Stratosphere to the Galaxy S7 Works perfect no lag time Is perfect for what I need it for The phone was delivered to me under 24 hrs which was perfect Everything functions on the phone and in a lot of ways is better then the other phones I have had Dont know why I bought this phone Not happy with it at all Samsung runs everything in the phone Im going to Android this phone gives me a headache by the time I can get a task completed Compared to Galaxy S5 the S7 is not as good mainly the small screen and battery life is terrible I had a S3 and then and S5 when the 5 started breaking down I bought the S7 I wish I could make my S5 live longer  Reception is awful with the S7 compared to the S5 and S3 to the point that I miss a LOT of calls  Also the battery life is terrible worst Ive had and not half the life of the S3 or S5  Really disappointed and cant afford to change again now Great phone a little slow on boot although It is great on overall performance It holds up to time fairly well The battery could have lasted a bit longer but is fine aside from that What worries me is the internals in the phone The rear glass isnt as strong as I had hoped for and the digitizer is very susceptible to damage After maybe only 2 or so drops from less than 5 feet the phone will most likely experience issues It would be nice if later on there are to be easier to remove hardware instead of using the adhesive on the glass It makes repairs expensive and difficult I got my first Galaxy S7 edge a year ago very durable Unfortunatly it fell one to many times in the wrong surface and 
Well no time to freak out thanks to phone insurace Ive got another Galaxy S7 tranfering my apps and other stuff wad made extremely easy thanks to the Samsung app I got my Galaxy S7 phones through Asurion claims I got my first S7 when my Note 4 couldnt be repaired and that S7 lasted for two years I hoped I would get a similar upgrade when the first S7 gave out but they sent me the identical phone I have always been unhappy with a smaller screen but what really irritates me about getting the same device again is that clearly Samsung has no intention of upgrading the S7 to Android Pie So even though Ive paid a deductible to Asurion Im still going to be forced to pay again to eventually to upgrade to a device with Pie I dont think this planned obsolescence is fair to consumers The screen is too sensitive and jumps features such a split screen Screen will shut down and sometimes lock even though you have an app running such as an audiobook or faceback At other times the screen is not responseive to a touch selection I find it quite annoying Great phone in terms of operations smotthness and camera just my screen chacked with a small fall So I dont trust all this marketting words like gorilla glass Also microsphone is giving cranking sound and there is no physical service center nearby that I can walk in to talk to a human rep There is only one problem I have with this phone No screen rotation Not good for watching movies or videos Everything else is great I bought this right before Christmas because the old phone was breaking and I didnt want an apple phone because their 7th phone doesnt have a headphone jack and Im always using wired headphones while charging my phone Last but not least it has it has a better camera This review was collected as part of a promotion This phone has lasted me multiple years now and is still in great condition The phone does not have the best specs as there are phones that arenewer but for the price the phone works great and provides enough for day to day communication and playing a few apps for fun I am during the NEXT program with ATT to purchase this phone I got 8 months left before I am done since Ive had the phone I love everything about this model the S7 I think it is the coolest best version I had since the S3 I have had this phone for almost 2 years and I must say it has served me well I totally love the size screen the feel the responsiveness of the touch screen I must say it takes awesome photos I can always bet on this phone to make me look great My husband being a professional photographer is super impressed with the photos taken by this phone I am saddened they no longer makes the edge The only issue it was hard to find screen protectors that are perfect for the screen but thats what happens when you have a phone with a curved edge Overall this is a fantastic phone Great phone but text message app on receive end is always a minute ahead when I reply Recently got an S7 through ATTAsurions Warranty after my S6 of nearly 2 years started having problems charging and found the battery was swelling and getting rather annoyed with the S7 lagging drastically when playing Pokemon GO compared to the S6 I had before Makes it REALLY hard to correctly land NiceGreatExcellent Curveball throws now which makes the main part of the game catching pokemon more of a pain For being a brand new phone battery life is horrible very nice phone very fast waterproof and lots of features however after 3 years of use the battery is not as good when it was new and the phone ALWAYS runs hot especially after restarting or charging wirelessly also after restarting it is quite slow I was angry at Verizon because I kept getting dropped calls and I was frustrated  I tried Consumer Cellular  They were accident prone in their ability to make the transfer  Once they did the transfer I found that I had NO reception  I had to come back to Verizon  I solved my poor reception by purchasing a Wilson Amplifier for my service  It works fine  I am very happy with all the other reasons to have Verizon except for my receiption  Now that that is fixed I am happy I usually get really bored with phones within 3 months Ive had this phone for almost 2 years  Im still not ready to part with it It still works like new  Ive never had an issue with it I usually prefer android over apple but this phone is difficult to use It doesnt seem like it takes input from the keyboardwell and there are areas of my screen the seem low functioning I have to type messages over and over and Im super frustrated I have had this thing for less than a month and its so annoying Freezes up runs slow I MISS MY S6 The only reason I have tge S7Egde is because my old one got damaged and I didnt want to buy a new one so I claimed it on insurance UghI DO NOT REXOMMEND SAMSUNG S7 EDGE I bought this to replace s5  battery life sucks Phone is overheating  rapid battery drain  less than 6 hours Hot to the touch 6 months out of warranty VERY Disappointed The phone works pretty well but the Samsung cloud sucks it is byzantine  impenetrable Every page does nothing but try to sell another Samsung product I have been using the Galaxy S models since the first one I have been impressed with every Galaxy since Kind of expensive Could have bought an Apple for about the same price but wanted to try a Samsung product I used this phone for about 2 years before upgrading to a newer Samsung phone I did not experience any major problems I was impressed that the battery seemed to still hold a good charge all day its been my experience with phones that the battery only lasts about 2 years then its time to get a new phone Camera takes pretty good pictures I do like the Samsung Galaxy series very much I had a Samsung S4 for a couple years and this year I wanted to buy the Samsung S7 I bought one off of ebay from a well known tech company Diamond Wireless that was refurbished but when I received my new Samsung Galaxy S7 it was not able to charge via an electrical cable and outlet I had to buy a wireless charger through Amazon which cost me additional  and wait for that to arrive in the mail before I could charge my Galaxy S7 I contacted the ebay seller and they were very professional and apologetic about the problem and agreed to give me a full refund for it so I sent it back and I am waiting for the full refund Once that refund is credited to my account I can then use that same money to buy another Galaxy S7 or higher because even though I experienced this problem I think it had more to do with the company not doing a good job refurbishing my cell phone then it id with the actual phone I love the Android OS I also like many of the features and apps etc It is almost 3 years and the phone is still in great shape The last oreo update however is causing heat issues on my phone in navigation apps such as waze and google maps I have used this phone for over a year with no problems I do have a habit of charging my phones when I can and trying to keep them above 50 charge at all times About 1 month ago my S7 Verizon phone was noticeably bloated and warm after 3 hours on charge using USB cable on computer USB 30 with plenty of power Discovered that the battery was over twice the size and the back of the phone had come partially off I ended up replacing the battery and now use the phone as a backup to my other phone by switching sim cards Dont know if phone was ever hot but the battery never leaked and the phone works fine This is about replacement phones To many functions and settings are hard for me to find I would say that the phone works very well for what I have figured out how to use My doctors told me I needed to get a good cell phone so they could get in touch easier Bought this phone a little over a year ago and not long maybe a week or two after getting had to send in for a new one because the internal unit went out Now 13 months later the charging port is going out and I paid way to much for this to be happening PERIOD Hundreds of users complain of the same issue As soon as the warranty expires this phone starts failing There is no resolution It was simple designed that way Been through 3 of these and they dont survive any kind of frontal drop Tried Otter box and the defender glass protector but both failed due to the curved screen I love Samsung products but this curved screen is just not durable Going back to something with a flat screen I got this phone a few days ago and realized the software still wasnt updated I tried to update it but its not updatingI dont know whats wrong Bought the s7 unlocked and when I got it the home button did not work sent it back and still havent even seen my refund and its been weeks just terrible The phone screen stopped working after being partially submerged in 3 of water for about 20 sec It certainly didnt live up to 3ft for 30min The water resistance feature was one of the main reasons I went with Samsung My S5 seemed to hold up to water much better as I was able to rinse it off from time to time However other than this the phone was fine I bought this 2 years ago and its a very good phone After 2 years this is my favorite phone 
 its the perfect size and the curved screen design is very cool and unique Phone is surprisingly sturdy and worked great for about a year  Camera pics were great front and rear just great phone

about a year into it things drastically slowed down  i figured something was bogging it down so i did a factory reset  still slow  did a memoryRAM test to find that it was running exceptionally slow  nothing I could fix  I liked the phone but the RAM failing killed it for me Have had the phone for almost a year just to notice the battery started to swell up pushing the back off my phone From what I can see this is a pretty common occurrence for this specific phone I love this phone Im a heavy user and Ive been very happy with this phone all 2 years It does everything I need it to Im going to trade it in for a note 9 because I feel like Im due for an upgrade I love Samsung It still feels as fast as the first day I got it Currently running Android 80 Oreo Samsung experience 90 This phone has treated me very well for the past 25 years that Ive owned it Durable fast and reliable Seriously couldnt of asked for a better phone for the price range I purchased it for in early 2016 i brought this phone and happy with its features and the style it posses I am very happy with the purchase of the phone but I wish I could update to Oreo It only allows it to update over wifi and I dont have an available wifi connection I have unlimited data and I dont mind using it for updates it is a great phone I dont drop calls The reception is great and it is very light I wish the battery would last a little longer Network connection is horrible  It is nowhere reliable as my old Galaxy S5 I bought this phone about a month ago because my other Samsung S7 started acting up  First the camera lense  broke which was my fault  But then the battery started draining quickly and I started getting disconnected when someone was trying to call me  I used my Insurance to purchase another Samsung S7 phone  My new or refurbished phone keeps telling me I dont have a SIM card install and it wont let me make phone calls  I have to restart the phone each time this happens to get it to start working again  I am not happy at all Ive had my Galaxy 7 for over a year and have never had any problems I love the fact that Samsung updates the operating system regularly keeping my S7 up to date  My wife also has an S7 and likes hers too Were retired and find it easy to use and the large screen makes it easy to read texts The only issue Ive ever had is my battery seems to drain more quickly than my wifes and she uses her more often than I dootherwise a quality dependable phone I purchased this unlocked phone in March 2017 Just 4 months after the warranty expired a half of the screen turned grey or glitched I used to have another Samsung phone Note 3 that had lasted just right beyond warranty coverage period This is the second time their products only survive long enough not to be responsible under warranty coverage This review was collected as part of a promotion It runs really hot Which isnt good because Im a YouTuber  my phone is my main tool Without it I have nothing 
Also this curved screen is a real pain too Its always performing actions I dont want unless I hold the phone a certain way The phone is faster than my droid maxx but it gets so hot so quick and the battery drains so fast startes closing apps Where I can still use my droid maxx with no problems if it wasnt for the maxx not being able to update to the new apps I would still use it Heres the thing I bought the first phone new in store It was GLORIOUS for a year it was fast the pictures were beautiful and I was in love until one fateful day the thing would shut off Randomly  Then it stopped charging Verizon sent me a replacement A refurbished model Ok fine I had the old one for a year so I guess I deserved a refurbished model Until a week later it was having trouble being a phone after a couple resets we seemed to be ok up until two months ago when the phone stopped responding to touch or button presses of any kind Ever since Samsungs big update the phone battery drains super fast How fast My phone charges to 100 and then if I use it at all it will need to be charged again in three hours  It will hold out for 5 or 6 hours if I dont use it at all apps are constantly crashing etc  NOT THRILLED My opinion Samsung is the only cell phone you need its the only cell phone I will ever use I will not use any other brand Im back using my S7 because my S9 was lost or stolen and I do not have the money to replace it as of now But I went back to my S7 because it was a great phone also but the S9 Plus that I owned I miss dearly FREEZES ALL TIME Ive had 2 and both of them have done it Once they freeze they shut off for 23 minutes and you cant get them back on One of the WORST phones Ive ever owned for the price Overheats BAD when charging Battery is average I personally would NOT recommend this phone Only 1 problem  the auto rotate goes off somehow and it is hard to find the way to set it back on  I dont think there is a way  I just restart the phone and get lucky when it come back  Otherwise perfect in every way  very good phone  I recommend it  Id buy another but I like them larger I like this phone a lot I mean Ive had minor issues with it shutting down or apps stop working and decide to never open afterwards The most issues I have with this phone is the screen Even with a screen protector on it still gets cracked very easy You drop it a few times and it shatters Even if you have the best phone case on it it still shatters They need to stop selling this phone While the Galaxy S7 is approaching two years old and while the price has dropped to about half of its introductory price it is still a very good value for the money I you are looking for cutting edge features found in the S9 products line you will not find them in this phone It is a phone that has two years worth of updates and customer use under its belt Also being a GSM and CDMA phone it can be used piratically anywhere in the world Just pop in a locally purchased SIM card and you are good to go The Galaxy S7 is still a very powerful smart phone and so far I have really enjoyed using it I like my s7 it works great but Im still pretty slow Im still learning how to operate it I really like it It is a good phone Since the Las updates a couple of weeks ago my phones battery is draining so fast it takes hours to chargeIts lagging it freezes upBut my 1 issue is it take at least 5min ro get my phone to unlock sometimes longer this is all started happening since this last update but my main question is with having a child and medical issues what happens if I need to call 911 You cant even get to the emergency part of the phone most of the time it takes for ever to get the screen to come up just to unlock the phone I used to have a Samsung S4 and I recall it did updates every month just as this one does but this last update has really messed everything up This phone is so much fun and does so much more than I will probably use Its wonderful   Its my little computer  scheduler alarm clock  music player and etc The phone is sturdy and thank you to the engineer who finally offset the screen off key from the volume down key The keyboard is difficult to use and I dont understand why it is so hard to make the pbone know up from down in rotate mode
Great screen very vivid a bit too sensitive but a great phone Garbage phoneCamera stop working and flash lightIt is not better than any other phone i had beforeUsed for one and a half years Would not recommend this phone This phone has great features unlimited ways to get the most usage out of the product Good phone so far only have had it a few weeks Bright display but for middle aged man it takes a bit of trial  error to get everything set up correctly without giving everyone your location and personal information They are pushing the S9 as the newest and it is But you pay for it The S7 is a solid peace of technology and does everything you need want and only costs 12 of the newer models Performance is adequate for my needs I like the compact size BEST UPDATE EVER THANK YOU I GET FULL DATA BARS AND WIFI IS FULL STRENGTH THANK YOU OTHERS SLOWED THEIRS DOWN YOU SOUPED OUR UP 
 THANK YOU SANSUNG Ive purchased one been charged for one replacement and received 2 replacements free So Im on my 4th and today I had it tell me it was going to take 2 hours and 28 minute to charge 62 So I start talking with Verizon talk to 3 different people Then Im told that its passed there hours to address my issue I wouldnt recommend this phone to my worst enemy This device exceeds all of my needs very proficient and user friendly and it performs as solid as it feelsgreat phone I do not see point buying Samsung devices going forward Poor support and extremely sluggish Android updates will prevent me from considering samsung in the future I am on my 4th week trying this phone and I gotta say I am very impressed of how they kept this phone in the loop for a while When Im through with an exercise I can check my heart rate to see how fast or slow it is This device has a stunning glass cover on the back of the phone that really makes it feel like this phone was meant to be around a very long time I switched from an iPhone SE To this and it is amazingly more bigger and customizable than any other phone I have had The only things I have to say had about the phone is the performance and the camera The iphone camera went smooth across any lighting and didnt drop framerates This is a kind of a pet peeve of mine but I quickly got over it because it made up with a more detailed studio mode The performance is a little laggy at times and it kinda gets on my nerves a little but thats what you would expect with an older phone Overall I give this device a big thumbs up for all the easy access and creativity that was put into this phone Ive had this phone for over a year and I honestly cant find one useful thing to do with the curved screen design Id say thats the biggest let down of the device it makes it feel like youre going to be pressing something on the screen by mistake every time you hold it without a cover which its another big issue the device design makes it really hard to find a good cover for it forget lifeproof cases the curved screen makes it impossible to have a waterproof case that has good quality or a well fitted screen protector at least the screen quality its pretty good and so far this whole time Ive only gotten a small scratch on it Id honestly stick to regular screen phones Also phone performance its not good at all after a few months of use I already had to do a factory reset to get it back to work properly only to go back to slow performance no more the fast opening of the camera with the double click of the home button in resume Id say this phone is as god as others that came before with a lower price point S7  Bought the Phone in Dec2017 and its too delicate although its supposed to be a high quality screen but when I dropped it both the screen and LCD got broke which is not covered in warranty Worst part is such an expensive phone and its too delicate while the Samsung Galaxy Core prime phone which I have dropped multiple times on hard floor is intact

Not worth when you spend so much Cheaper phones are better sturdy Ok so I have had an iPhone X for months Glass just like the samsung But first day I got my samsung for work I set it down and snap the glass breaks on the back My iPhone doesnt have a scratch after weeks of no case That is not the issue with me though My issue is that 90 percent of the time the fingerprint scan doesnt work The os isnt as fluid as the iPhone And it just doesnt seem as fast Sorry but I am not a fan of the os or the features As an engineer it is a bigger deal for me to have functionality than looks For now I will stick with my iPhone I do see they are getting better and I started with the first galaxy s1 and have had each one for work I will never purchase one with my own money 
 On the plus side though they are getting better though Maybe in a few years I will be a convert but not anytime soon After 2 years of great service and my 7 year old grandson playing with it everyday I told my daughter that is the phone I want to get Because I know if the s7edge can withstand all his actions for 2 years and this was the first time they made it didnt need a replacement Broke the phone lcd twice Screen did not Crack but lcd busted when I bought my last upgrade Samsung S7 edge I had to change it 3 times and the 3rd one only last for a year and a half its not charging now and my warranty expired and I didnt even pay off the phone I have 6 months more to go for the payment Feel really bad when it came to 3rd time to exchange within that 14 days I should have chosen another one instead of Samsung I think this is a problem with Samsung S7because all other Samsung I used and my family using are really good HATE IT The keyboard is overly sensitive and much different than my S5 Many typos absolutely irritating Worst phone I have ever had Returning it Hopefully the 8 or 9 will be better They are way over priced anyhow So ridiculous After less than 18 months my battery started to drain quickly I found myself charging it up to 3 times a day and this was with minimal use HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED  The S7 is much improved on my old S6 The ability to add memory was greatly needed along with some other tweaks that make this phone operate smoothly I like that they didnt mess with the things that work well but improved the areas that needed it like the fingerprint scanner i have had 2 galaxy S7 phones and both of them have overheated my most recent one overheated to 167 degrees Fahrenheit and got so hot the back screen cracked i have now been without a phone for 3 weeks since Samsung has received it and havent been told when i am getting my phone back phone is good on performance but overall not worth the purchase
Date 4192018 Phone used to overheat  crash Did reset it couple of times over the last 1yr 3 months Phone completely died on me on 16th April2018 Purchase date 14 Jan 2017  my phone got 3 shadow line across the screen i never dropped the phone so Another Samsung Product Am a Huge Samsung Advocate Samsung has yet to fail me Only reason that I have this Samsung S7 is I desired and upgrade but do not like the size of the S8 and S9 Galaxy S7 Edge I Love its performance in all aspects Long lasting energy and great speed of processing the information brings the realtime user experience  This thing has taken an absolute beating with me Dropped almost everyday been camping in the desert mountains and mudflats and through the laundry an uncountable number of times and every single time it still works perfectly fine Had it for 2 years and havent had a single issue Takes great pictures too My only complaint is the smallish storage of 32Gb because I love taking pictures and videos with it so much Its pretty durable and has a lot of featureits light battery dies way to fast i will loos 10 batt life on a 2 min phone call if it has a 100 batt life before i got to bed it will be at 20 when i wake up in the AM and just the normal amount of apps run in back ground phone restarts on its own and its very slow It drops Wify all the time no matter where im at  I have gone through 3 so far Phone gave me nothing but trouble no longer alows me to update phone updates fail no matter what can no longer access gallery and Samsung cloud crashed every few minutes its terrible and slow I used to be only about Motorola but when I tried the S7 out I fell in love with it Long story short Im no longer a Motorola fan This phone is by far the best phone Ive ever Had I was not happy with the S5 lack of battery life Changed to a Motorola Turbo Droid but its battery didnt hold up either The S7 seems to be doing better Nice look the size fits my hand well I have had this phone for a bit over a year and a half now through verizon It has never let me down with its battery life durability water resistance or anything else The display is amazing in most situations Just the right size of phone for my hands The midnight black color is beautiful This phone is garbage The battery life goes down super quickly so quickly that I spent over a Benjamin Verizon wont post your review if you list a price on a second battery phone case and it still chews through both batteries in the course of a normal day with normal use The phone has a tendency to freeze and crash apps About the only good features of this phone are it being waterproof and having a nice camera I will absolutely NOT be buying a Samsung phone again and wish I never had
Wow And on top of this phone being absolute garbage Verizon refuses to post my review unless it is 150 characters long I am now also less pleased with Verizon because they obviously do their best to curb negative reviews and bolster only positive DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE Is this 150 characters Can I stop now so you will post my review and people can know how bad this phone is before they get it This phone was working okay when i i first received but now battery life is not good anymore Please do not buy this phone  i wouldnt go with this phone Ok I get the phone and go to the store to get some help setting it up NOW every other minute the  thing puts out an auto message that I am driving  I have been sitting at my kitchen table working when this happens   In the middle of a phone call and it goes to auto reply that Im driving  Please advise Doesnt network with printers too well at least compared iPhone Often requires extra software

Constant need to advance cursor in typing fields I LOVE this product and all Samsung products Samsung is a great brand Their products last a long time and have worked very well for me Hard to use hard to navigate wont stay paired to my truck A minimum of 50 charactures required Why do I need to write a book for you to underatand your service is the worst Do you think I have nothing better to do than type and count Why do you not allow for more where it asks if I like your service Because you dont want to know This phone is awesome One of the best things to get out of this phone is how it well it recorded audio It is great for concerts where phones tend to distort the audio or not pick up well The photo quality is pretty great especially in low light and got things done Updates are more frequent but its usually just security updates Hopefully more software updates in the future Only annoying thing is that the remote call would appear whenever I took calls and I couldnt get it to stop doing that Battery life is horrible does not even last a day Samsung is a horrible brand and would not recommend any samsung phone to anyone Going back to Droid or iPhone LESS functionality than my old S5 but then again THAT phone died after 15 months  IT tells me what to do  I have few usable overrides to customize it like the Samsung S5 This is a good phone if you had the Galaxy s5 before It is similar enough that you can pick up on the features quickly while still feeling new and fresh This phone is just OK but nothing to write home about  My last phone was a Motorola Droid Maxx and I loved that phone especially the battery life  Id replace this Galaxy S7 with that phone in a heartbeat if I could I didnt buy a new Motorola as they are physically larger than I want  Ive only had this Galaxy S7 for about 3 months and the battery life which wasnt great to start with is already degrading  I have to turn of location and WiFi at home to have the battery last the day and have to charge it every night and every morning as well  The performance is sluggish as well  Samsungs software skin over Android is really annoying especially the spell checker  The bright spot is the camera photos are great and of high quality This is my third Samsung Galaxy phone Started with the S5 and worked my way up No complaints with any or this one other than at times runs sluggish with a few apps going at the same time The screen does have burn marks but are not noticeable until the screen is a bright color like white or yellow I upgraded to this phone from the galaxy s5 I should have done more research Disappointed that my s5 16 has higher megapixels on it than the s7 12mp does I  also dont like that the viewing of the camera is like half of the screen Also cant take panoramic pictures with this phone either like i said i should have done more research 
Positives its fast easy to use lots of space for apps very easy to use 
just not what i was hoping for Ive owned this phone for almost 3 years now and it works as if I bought it yesterday  I will be purchasing a new phone but Ill be giving this one to my son
Its fast Extremely dependable Never given me a problem  The camera takes great pictures bluetooth wifi all features still work without a hitch  This is by Far The best phone Ive ever owned  I only hope the next one measures up to this one  It will be a tall order This phone is way to slick and slippery I have dropped this thing so many times that the screen is black but the phone still works The screen is unpredictable when touched Sometimes it will respond right away and sometimes I want to throw it against a wall because it will not respond at all I had a S4 before this one and the camera was much better Samsung went from a 16 pxl to a 12 pxl making the quality of the photos and video fuzzy I am going to use the cost of replacing it it is insured and they wont fix it toward paying it off so I can get an upgrade There is a reason they came out with the S8 so fast  I figure its because the S7 sucks Galaxy J7This phone freezes its slow and it doesnt work properly when it goes below 15 When it freezes I have to take out the battery for it to work Love the phone Ive had mine about 6 months now and couldnt be happier The camera is amazing in general not just for a phone The phone is easy to navigate and has plenty of features I recently switched to Samsung from a Droid and Im never going back I will eventually upgrade to whatever is the newest at the time Im due but until then I couldnt be happier I love my phone it has taught me a lot of things on my device its a great phone does all the things a phone should do However  and this is a big however  YOU CANNOT GET PROPER SCREEN PROTECTION Ive had a cell phone since the days of Ye Olde Nokia 3210 and this is the first one Ive ever shattered  TWICE Do yourself a favor and go for the s7 that doesnt have the edge The added functionality which Ive actually never used is NOT worth the added expense Operationally the phone is AOK Speed is good display is great camera is great and other than the Samsung keyboard I really had no major complaints

Externally I hate the housing The use of glass that extends past the bezel on both sides has resulted in a phone that is scratched up I know they make cases and glass protectors but I never needed any of those with the prior 3 Motorola phones I owned Additionally the handpiece speaker has suffered some sort of damage and is barely audible despite being set to maximum volume Id love to replace this stuff myself but with the phone being glued together Ive just been dealing with it for the past year

Overall it has been a decent phone but I look forward to replacing it with something that isnt so fragile and easier to repair Youll be sorry if you buy this phone  15 or 110 callers cant hear you  Very annoying  If you search the Google youll see this is a known issue and there is no fix as of Nov 2017  Ive had this phone for 10 days and Im returning it today Difficult to hold phone without making unintended contact on the phone screen This phone is pure garbage  I had to get another phone because of the recall of my Note 7 so I chose the Galaxy S7 Edge based on the reviews from online and friends  I have had this phone LESS THAN A YEAR and Ive had issues since the first few months  I called Verizon almost every month or every other month and they did nothing  I thought they were slowing down my data because the phone would freeze up for no reason this brand new phone that Id bought directly from Verizon but they swore they were not  At least once a week the phone freezes up stops working screen goes black or something stupid  Ive had plenty of dropped calls and some days Im not sure if the phone will work properly or not  The fact that Im paying monthly for this piece of junk phone infuriates me  I have been in the store several times to be told they can order a new refurbished phone for me but they cannot say the same thing would not happen  It is a waste of money and time and it is sad that Verizon cannot or rather WILL NOT do ANYTHING to help me resolve this issue  Im not going to keep calling in wasting my time for Verizon to tell me that there is nothing they can do  All this money spent on the Garbage S7 Edge and there is nothing I can do about it  UGH Really like this phone Easy to use but the battery life sucks It lasts maybe six hours Another problem is that if you have a problem with the battery or something internal on your phone you have to go the store so they can open it up for you because you cant do it on your own and that of course is expensive I am not pleased with the battery life on my samsung phone  It will not even last long enough for me  to work  I have warranty on my phone that Samsung will not honor The S7 honestly makes me miss my S5 I have constant issues with apps and texting with this phone The keypad is constantly changing my words to misspelled ones every time I type you it changes it to ypou and same with the word would is always changed to wpould and it doesnt matter how many times I try and correct it My texts will also stay stuck on sending for hours sometimes and no matter what I do I cant get them to send The Ive not even had this phone a year yet and cant wait to get rid of it Ive had this phone for almost a year now  Came from a Sony Xperia z3 and before that an iphone 5  Love this phone  its solid and stable  Overall its an improvement over my Sony which was good for its time and bought specifically because it had the best camera on the market  The Samsung s7s camera is just as good and doesnt overheat  

But the battery  Samsung we have to talk about this  I am a heavy user I use it for work constantly  My last two phones I could go from morning to night while charging it once per day in the middle  This Galaxy 7  I average having to charge it twice as much during the day  ARGH  If you are a heavy user make sure you are always carrying a battery pack thats all I have to say I lost my ancient flip phone and was thusly forced into the 21st century  I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab E tablet and like it so I investigated samsung phones  I picked the S7 because reviews said the S8 wasnt an improvement and the curved screen was problematic  I love this phone  It is easy to use and customize a nice bright and crisp screen and with our 4G service very fast  The only thing I would recommend is that if you are going to carry it loose in your purse as opposed to a separate pocket go to Amazon and get a flip case the Verizon store didnt offer me one  I broke my first Zagg glass screen protector that way  It was covered under warranty but it could have been my screen scratched or broken I started with an LG G3 and thought I was upgrading to a newer better phone with the S7  Wrong  The S7 may be good for most people but heres where they lost me  No decent voice search no call voice announcement no replaceable battery many absent OS options no panoramic pix options substandard recordingalso 3rd party software required worse display button layout less ergonomic had to get third party video player software no IR blaster no builtin security for folders  and other phone settings I wont even go into  The S7 is good for Baby Boomers still in the stone age I just upgraded to an S7 from an S5 a week ago I loved my S5 except the battery not holding charge very long The calendar was my absolute favorite thing about the phone With a rotating work schedule and busy home life with kids the S5 calendar was great for keeping me organized I didnt think twice when upgrading to the S7 boy was I disappointed The new calendar is horrible I have less control to change settings even the battery isnt that great and this is a brand new phone I would not recommend this phone at all Many of the upgrades to the S7 are just not that great Love it Never lets me down Battery life good lots of useful features that actually work the way they are supposed to I am a repeat Galaxy customer  I started with the facasinate S3 S5 now S7  I loved all the previous phones but this S7 has been a BIG disappointment   The call clarity and reception STINKS ITS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD  I  drop calls all the time and when I am talking I am told its all garbled up  Cant wait to get rid of this HORRIBLE phone Ive owned my S7 for about 2 yrs now I have to say with the exception of one time it dropped a call Ive had zero issues with my phone I did drop it once outside I have a good case  screen protector and no damage at all to the phone Great overall way better than iphone 6 and 7 Camera is incredible only downside is that it breaks easily because of the curved glass Its also expensive to repair so invest in a good case or insurance Ive had my phone for a year now and have only had some two issues with it The first issue that Ive had with my phone is being able to access the SD card and SIM card When you buy the phone they do give you a special tool that allows you to access the card compartment but it is such a small tool that nobody really keeps track of it For this reason I have given the Galaxy S7 a Fair rating is design They give you a tool but its very impractical The other issue Ive had with this phone is with overheating It was overheating to the point to the point that it could burn your cheek Luckily I was able to get it replace with another one Overall the phone is a Good phone I think the phone is where it should be in the year 2017 However Samsung can make some improvements to the next Galaxy S models to make them more admirable Maybe my standards are low but this is by far one of my favorites phones slick and quick great with pictures only hard part was trying to find cases that will consider the rounded edge and not warp or mess up the screen protector Probably didnt need a screen protector but old habits This smartphone is the best money can buy It adapts to your every need This smartphone has replaced my wallet
Great battery life Amazing speed Great camera Love the waterproof feature Love Fast Charging and Fast Wireless Charging
Overall an amazing phone I upgraded from an S6 which was still working but battery life was going way down I looked at the S8 but the edge just looked too fragile to me The screensaver every one complained about on the S8 page made my decision to go with the S7 easy I love the S7 It has everything I need in a phone Thrilled with the expandable memory and the water resistance The camera is also an upgrade from my 6 I have had it 2 months now with no issues The battery lasts me all day which I love I charge it every night even if it doesnt need it One thing I worry about with Samsung phones is the fact that the S8 does not give us an option without the edge I do not want an edge phone Overall this has been a great phone My last phone was the Galaxy S3 so the 7 feels faster and more capable The only problem Im having is the inability to edit the dictionary that is used to typeswype with On my S3 I could go to the dictionary and edit words and make the phone auto replace words when I misspell something The GS7 has a worse keyboard than the S3 Theres no dictionary to edit the auto replace feature When I misspell a word I go back and delete it and spell it correctly but the S7 will still automatically insert the misspelled word again if Im not careful It inserts words that arent words and has a far worse vocabulary and swype than the S3 The S7 is a good phone but when it comes to the dictionary and typing the S3 has it beat I hope the S8s swype and language options are as good as the S3 when I upgrade 

The camera on the S7 is also another downgrade from from the S3 That older phone had a separate Macro feature and better quality photos than the S7 The 7 cant really do close up photos without zooming in which defeats the purpose of close ups Dont get this phone if youre looking for something with a great camera or swype

Its the best phone Ive had so far camera and swype aside I give the Swype and language options a 1 star and camera 3 stars Droped my s7edge 1 ft it hit the edge and cracked lcd so after buying the phone a week ago i have to have ir fixed weak glass Phone is perfect I have had no problems with this phone Easy to use This is the first smart phone I purchased outside of Apple products and it was a mistake from the get go The phone doesnt hold up to water nor is it shatter resistant I have also noticed when charging the phone it becomes ridiculously hot It also decided to completely reset itself and erase all my data while on a business trip AND lock me out of using it for 24 hours thanks for that Google You guys really set the bar high with this one

All in all once this thing is paid off in full I will be using it as target practice with my 22 I purchased the phone online and picked up the phone the next day in store My previous phone was an S5 This phone looks similar is slightly smaller and with a glass back instead of the rubbery

The phone in the few hours that it worked was constantly warm if not hot The first thing I did when activating the phone was lowering the screen intensity and turning off the Always on feature Still the warmed of the phone was slightly disconcerting

Later on before going to bed in the middle of setting the alarm app the screen briefly blacked out with some white streak lines towards the top maybe for about 13 a second then the screen died It would not turn on Attempting to factory reset by holding down the power button and the volumn down button would cause the screen to display in green and it was completely unresponsive Apparently this is a known an common issue

My previous and still current phone is the S5 which has survived drops scratches and even being submerged in water for five seconds This new phone was not able to even work for a day unfortunately and the green screen is a googleable issue that occurs often Also the constant warmth of the phone does not seem like the phone was capable of lasting for an extended duration

This is just my experience but I returned it the next day I do not believe this is a phone for those who are looking for something stable and capable of lasting Even people who take really good care of this version tend to have issues with the hardware down the line so the design is fundamentally flawed My Galaxy S7 is by far the BEST phone Ive owned so far I ABSOLUTELY K LOVE IT This phone was good when I first got it but after a couple of months the performance of the device decreased more and more the gets really hot while charging and loses charge very fast For example if go to sleep with 100 I will wake up with 86 Very fun with the best apps good cameras for my use PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS Because if you are seriously considering this phone you need to know thisI love galaxy that is mostly why I invested in this phone and it is the best phone I have owned Onebatter life is great I can go 2 days with out charging it But you have to keep in mind if you are on it a lot then it may run down quicker than that Twoit has survived thru being accidentally thrown from the truck while driving on a highway and before I could get out to recover it was run over my another vehicle no lie and I probably has dropped at least 3 ft on concert like half of dozen times Yes it has a few scratches on it but it is still going strong Three my favorite part I love that is water resistant  I have taken under water about 5 ft for a least 30 mins with no damage to it I do not recommend charging the phone right after it gets wet I would wait at least 2 hours or until dryFourI also love that I can hit the hiking trails with it because it has survived being dropped in the snow and dirt I seriously recommend this phone I have been thru a lot of phones because they could not survive thru half of what this galaxy has I am an active person kayaking swimming hiking and it is great to have a phone to keep up with my crazy life Side note make sure you get durable case with it so you can save it from getting cracks I upgraded to an S7 when my S6 wore out I much prefer my old phone I dont like the correction feature for anything I do  text message Facebook emails etc  and it seems to get worse with each upgrade It seems I am more limited in what I can do now vs before Tried to use the S7 edge after the Note 7 issues returned mine 2 time because I had to  never experienced any issues LOVED THE NOTE 7  didnt like the smaller phone Eventually changed to the IPhone 6 

SO SO happy to hear the Note 8 is ready to go I have already preregistered and will be getting it in September Cant wait to have a stylus again I have had the S7E for almost a year now and I am still impressed by its performance and features The edge apps add that extra layer of usability The camera and battery life are excellent Samsung knows about a defect with the display of the Galaxy S7 showing vertical opaque dark lines but challenges consumers that report it  I am not a big fanof Samsung not Verizon While this phone is decent for making calls and taking photos it cannot hold a Wifi connection  I have tried every fix I can find to no avail  I shouldnt have to go around trying to fix something that should work already  My iPhone was great with connections  Maybe Samsung needs to take some lessons Easy enough to navigate for the most part  It could have a larger screen and should include free caller id and should have a better sound system  ie speakers Got a certified preowned Galaxy S7 through Verizons insurance plan to replace a phone that my son dropped  The replacement phones LCD died after he dropped it ONE time from about 2 feet off the ground  We are so disappointed  my older son has dropped his Galaxy S7 about 20 times with just a slight crack in the screen  I dont understand why this replacement phone was so darn fragile This is my first Samsung smart phoneReally disappointing to see battery getting drain quickly for normal use and it heats up very badlyDespite NOTE 7 failurei went to buy S7 but its disappointing My phone drop from my clip about three feet of the ground and that screen broke even though that I had the case to protect the phone they call the defender and it still broke the screen if I compare that to my Galaxy S5 with the same case protector a fell off twice from the 6 floor one time and the topsoil the second time on the concrete and nothing happened to the phone Im really disappointed at this product I wish they still make them with that screen same strength as Galaxy S5 or better I bought this phone about a year ago and its still going strong from the beautiful amoled screen to the 12 mp camera this phone shines the water resistance is spot on from beach pool and rain water it pretty much takes it all my only complaints about it is the slight freezing once in awhile along with the stitching on some photos world view mostly and finding a good case along with a glass screen protector since the curve but very minor details its an amazing phone nonetheless LIKE EVERY SAMSUNG PHONE ITS SLOW AFTER A FEW UPDATES
THE BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE I ALWAYS HAVE LOW BATTERY LIFE EVEN WITH FAST CHARGING THE BATTERY SUCKS Samsung refused to fix the pink line issue because I had a crack in my screen I never asked for the screen to be replaced but I wanted the pink line taken care of Its been almost 15 years still works like a charm battery backup is great camera is best in class
quality is great It lose It lose 20 more battery for sitting on the nightstand for an overnight idling  Phone is warm most of the time  It doesnt support read screen function like the iphone does which turns all kindle books in my old phone to be Audible  I very much regret for switching from iphone to Samsung The video quality of the screen is fantastic whenever the whole screen decides to work The phone is very slow compared to other phones of the same generation My wife owns an LG G5 that out preforms the S7 is almost every way My friends Moto Z outclasses the S7 like the Galaxy line deserves to be on the Oregon Trail
The S7 is slow to load almost everything constantly has WiFi connectivity issues comes with a third of the functions of other generation phones and the right half of the screen will turn static grey fairly often Which by the way is a fairly common problem that is blamed on phone damage but acts like a software issue since it is not a consistent problem Buyers beware I have been a die hard Samsung customer since the S2 The S7 has made me lose all faith the company I was not prepared for them to release such trash as the S7 So much so it will take an awful lot for me to even think about buying another Samsung phone ever again The first Galaxy I owned was a Galaxy S3 followed by the Galaxy S4  Those two were great phones  I recently upgraded to the Galaxy S7  Samsung has made excellent improvement in battery life and features such as the camera  A big plus to me is being able to expand memory via the sd card slot   Keep up the great work Samsung This phone can be hard to put down at times It has so many great features and customization This is a great phone The camera is the best Ive seen yet It even has slow motion Gaming features are awesome you all did a great job The fingerprint sensor is very helpful the phone goes so fast sometimes I have to catch up with it haha Overall outstanding I love the Galaxy brand they are easy to navigate and has alot of app availability  The design of the S7 though is a different story I have had my S7 since November 2016 and am going on replacing the back for a third time it was not a bright idea to make it out of glass The worst part is It is in and otterbox case The box should have warning label extremely fragile phone is ALL glass I took my phone out of the case to put a new screen protector on it After putting the screen protector on the phone slipped and I dropped it from a few feet in my kitchen The BACK of the phone shattered I had no idea it was all made of glass The phone is silver I just assumed it was a metal I am totally sickened The phone still works and I put it back in the protective case But my brand new phone is all crackled in the back I wouldnt have bought this phone if I had know how fragile it is Definitely not a phone for kids or teens I usually keep my phone for years but I doubt this one makes it through this year So I guess I could use the insurance but then I would get a used phone Im just really disappointed in Samsung Id prefer the old plastic back phone to one this breakable Another unfortunate problem just like my previous Galaxy S3 I take a lot of pictures and while the phone and other features seem to work okay Samsung has a problem with the cameras failing Quite disappointed in both of my last two Samsung phones Not to mention I just got it a few months ago The price is way to high for something that fails Ive tried every troubleshooting fix I can find Another disappointment for me is that it comes loaded with a bunch of apps that I dont ever use And they constantly need updating Some of the apps I kept removing and they reappear a couple of weeks later asking to be updated I think Ill try the A word in the next phone which also Im wary of Galaxy S5 was a great phone S7 exceeds it by far all the Great features you loved in S5 are right here in S7 Ive had my S7 Edge since October 2016 and its been replaced twice Im on my 3rd one for various reasons It over heats when charging and using the vr goggles It stopped vibrating and the home button rarely works Its never been dropped or damaged in any way Has had a screen protector and reliable case on it since I bought it Ive checked all the settings and syncs and the phone either doesnt alert me that I have google or yahoo email or its will alert me hours later I love this phone however the reception is not good In my house I have to be in certain areas to even get 1 bar My wifes Iphone on the same service works like a champ anywhere in the houseMy previous Iphones were not bothered by this issue in my home either Love the phone for its features camera and screen but Im going back to the iphone because I actually need to make and receive phone calls at home Got my new phone yesterday afternoon and it finally accepted my fitbit after an update Turning the bluetooth phone and fitbit on and off did not help until the update
Hoping this also helps my sketchy internet connection also

Besides those 2 issues I am so far loving this phone Battery Sucks which is a let down as the phone is otherwise decent I dont know why I have to have one hundred and fifty characters to get this review The S7 is a ok android phone for light usage Mine has been draining sooo quick not as quick as a budget phone luckily my contract expires in 2 days Ive had this phone for about 2 months now and I dont understand  the rave reviews  about  long battery life  I have not added any apps to the phone  It is just as it came from Verizon and with moderate use the battery will be below 10 percent in less than 8 hours    
  The phone works ok other than that but I regret getting it I usually buy only Motorola phones and have always had good luck with them Skip this phone Edge screen makes it more difficult to use Samsung products generally faulty I hate my phone and wish I had never bought it This is my first Samsung phoneI am 65yoa and I have been a VZW customer for at least 12 years I bought this phone because my husband has a Samsung 5 which I keep getting told every time I  pay the bill hes paid for and would he like new phone His works great Mine will shut off when I am typing a text or looking something up I am disabled and it is super sensitive to touch Not good if you are over 50 Hard to hear on unless you use speaker  really dont want everyone knowing my business  I am extremely disappointed Glad on payments that is good plan for seniors not so much invested if you die before its paid for Maybe that was vzw thought Dont get this phone If I had it to do over I would get the Google I also dont like all the apps that are loaded by vzw that I have no use for This device has almost everything we asked for except IR Blaster Which is a bummer but I can live without it I love this phone because all of the new features that it has This review was collected as part of a promotion I love this phone all the bottons are raised up i dont have all the feeling in my fingers but these are high enoght for me to feel them so i dont always have to look at it i also got to chose one for my work phone  my hubby has the same one so i dont have to learn a new phone most of my faily has this oneMy mother live 2 hour away we got her this one so i could tell her how to work it I will never have a nother phone or tablet that is not Samsung Literally slipped out of a diaper bag 2 ft off the ground and is now leaking whatever kind of fluid Screen is cracked and inoperable if it was not so expensive to pay off the phone I would switch brands never in all my years of owning a Samsung have they been so stupidly easy to break even without a case 2 feet off the ground is nothing I have dropped my old one higher and more often without a case before and never had an issue with it I am very dissatisfied this phone is made to break easily and not be used unless you gonna treat it with kid gloves This is a good phone but one day I went to get it off the charger and the glass over the camera was shattered and I have no idea how I have not dropped it once and then thay happen of all the smart phones on the market the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge have my highest rating I got the S7 for my wife after she had used my s7 edge for a few days it was either buy her one or lose mine this is a tough phone can take a fall or two and receive no damage pictures are crisp and clear service and battery life better then i expected lots of apps and features I asked if she like to upgrade last week and it was no she wont part with it until it is dead This is a great phone and i love samasung internet I am a TRUE galaxy fan Before owning the S7 I had the S5 and the switch was an easy transition I have always loved the versatility of the Samsung cell phones The S7 characteristics I love are durability speed user friendly and reliability The display is bright and crisp Music sounds great on the device Ill continue to be a Samsung user for a long time to come Sound quality is very bad and some apps closed automatically mainly facebook google hangout dialer etc This phone has every feature I want in a phone It is fast has great picture quality and has a great camera Great phone except my battery dies about 10 an hour when NOT using it If I use any apps especially navigation it will drop about 3040 in an hour I was a little nervous about this phone as it was a replacement for my Note 5but I love it I was going to get an Iphone but I decided to stick with this particular series of Samsung phones Love that Samsung keeps the software the same but makes the updates to adjust to the new products and features the world is evolving into Phone operates great its speedy great photos and a good screen  But it gets terrible signal  Places were HTC or Motorola phones get signal my Samsung S7 wont  For this reason I will switch back to Motorola or HTC I use this phone for just about everything in my everyday life whether it be shopping banking pictures or information on the go I love the features and the vibrant display and overall its not really too big and the battery life is great This review was collected as part of a promotion Although its a great phone there are glitches with it You can type a recognized word spelled correctly and the phone will auto correct it to something else This has happened many times and is very frustrating

The phone is generally nice and works well but for someone like me who needs to be able to input information for work correctly the auto correct is not worth it This phone has a Bluetooth connectivity issues but as long as you dont do a update this phone is great By far my favorite phone Ive ever owned Great features easy to use long battery life Im very pleased with it I have had the Samsung S4 S5 active and a Note3 before owning a S7 edge I really loved my S5 active the camo color as well as the durability was awesome The 7edge is such a clearer screen and looks sleeker The only issue I have is with connecting my bluetooth to my car audio It worked for a while but now it will only play music not work for calls Also miss having the infrared to use as a remote My old Samsung 3 phone worked better  Im on my second S7 first one had battery problems within 6 months so they sent me a new one  Now that the 8 is out Im having troubles again after an automatic update I got this phone through work and was very excited to have the top of the line samsung device After about a year the phone is still as good as it was out of the box and it runs great My only complaint is that I dont love touchwiz or whatever the samsung launcher is I came from a Motorola x 2nd gen and I really liked the stock android feel of their design with the google now launcher and menus I know touchwiz has a lot of features packed into it but I found it unappealing to look at for the most part On the other hand the various themes help it to look better visually and thats nice Good basic Android phone I dont want anything fancy and its similar to the older models but more enhancements which make it simple vs a iPhone that breaks Mine hasnt even cracked yet just a screen protector ripped The processor is pretty fast to me The camera takes great pictures I wish Samsung could come up with a feature for motion pics I love the apps and features this phone has Its light and easy to grip All phones are expensive these days but this phone is not at the most expensive price I have seen Also I like how this phone is water resistantproof Been performing solidly Only wish it got software updates faster Can i use this phone with a cricket sim I am using cricket right now Overall I really liked the phone I dont like not being able to use the internet while using the phone My internet is constantly dropping on this one It took 2 hours to do an update If those issues would be fixed it would be great I do like everything else so far on it The only brand of phone I have owed within the last fews years has been Samsung and Ive always loved Samsung phones but this one does need some adjustments done Non interchangeable battery cannot connect to a PC for file transfers are just the start              My S3 was a lot better than this overpriced S7 Samsung phone was splashed while in pocket of purse which triggered error moisture in charging port Samsung warranty does NOT cover water damage even though their phone is advertised to be water resistant Ive had Samsung phones for several years with no complaints Love the Samsung S7 Edge Great picture quality camera action and ease of use I have iPhone that I use for work and this Samsung is a far better device hands down Continue on Samsung Its old school to have the sensor on the front but when the phone is sitting on a service I dont have to enter the passcode or pick it up to finger print unlock Like the fact that in the sub menu folders can be created and that there is a app tray The first week I dropped my phone from my pocket while getting up off a creeper The phone fell between 6 and 12 inches and cracked the screen Its slippery takes inputs from the edge of the screen where you are just trying to hold on to it preventing you from doing what you want and they made sure that when the battery fades the phone is all done Ive missed a hundred calls as touching the phone will always make it do exactly what you dont want it to do Ive never been so disappointed in an expensive bit of electronics At least it hasnt blown up or caught fire yet Wow to the next one cause the speed and performance have been all verizon could could do  and I would recommend Unfortunately Im pretty disappointed with this phone and it kills me to say because I have been trying so hard to like it I went from the droid maxx  that I had for at least 3 years to this and had such high expectations  I thought I did all my research  Reviews were great The battery sucks although it does charge quickly Its slick but no huge deal It is however SO STINKING FRAGILE Im trying not to freak out as Ive only had the phone two weeks but it fell out of my pocket a less than two foot drop and the screen shattered Seeing as Im buying this darned thing Ive now got to pay quite the premium to get it fixed 
Aside from that the signal is awful The picture quality is nice Its a slick phone but I really wish I had gone with something different 

My maxx had been dropped countless times and it looks next to new Then youve got this princess of a phone Sigh Samsung has great products and innovative technology Im confident Samsung stands behind all aspects of its quality smart phone technology Great phone battery is v low Even in power saving mode Battery drains fast Very durable water resistant and great camera Simple as it i love my phone i already have all galasy version and this one the design is the best I made a mistake transitioning from my iPhone 6 to the S7 After doing some research and receiving recommendations from a couple friends for this phone I decided to take a chance and get it a couple months ago However I have run into several problems since then even after trying to give it the benefit of the doubt A big issue for me is weirdly enough the camera The frontfacing one makes a persons head look distorted and abnormal and the rearfacing camera only looks great with adequate sunlight In addition Ive run into problems with my messages applications within the device and just annoying glitches that dont seem right for a newer phone While it does have some features that are impressive they dont outweigh the problems WORKS GREAT No problems  has great features such as the multiscreen window Soeakers work fantastic I have had the S7 for about a year and in general I hate it

The good
Good call clarity
No issues connecting with Bluetooth devices
Camera is OK

The bad
 The capacitive buttons do not stay off when using the Amazon Kindle app While it might not sound like a big deal it is really annoying when reading in the dark with the black background and when you go to turn a page your eyes are blinded by the capacitive buttons lighting up I had to download a 3rd party app to shut the off permanently
 Speaking of Amazon Kindle the S7 came preloaded with Kindle for Samsung It crashes All the time So much so that I just use the regular Kindle app Not sure how an app designed for a Samsung phone doesnt work on a Samsung phone
 While on the topic of crashing apps There are about 5 apps on my phone that regularly crash
 The battery isnt that great If I unplug at 800 in the morning often by noon I am below 50 with light use I am often looking for a place to charge up
 Fingerprint ID is slow at best My iPad is virtually instant this takes about 1 second to recognize
 WiFi randomly turns off and doesnt sign on to previously identified networks
 Automatic display brightness sometimes works and sometimes doesnt
 Contacts interface is clumsy and annoying I installed another 3rd party app drupe to manage my contacts and it is much more intuitive I had the S5 before upgrading to the S7 edge withij the past two weeks I love it The camera and interface are both beautiful and its really quick The only and biggest problem I have is its apparently extremely fragile The very first time i dropped it was from no higher than hip height and it cracked I have an otterbox case on and also had an otterbox case on my S5 and I dropped it a billion times without it cracking at all Galaxy series phones are trouble free fully supported and superior to any phone that I have ever owned previouslyincluding iphones  I will only buy Galaxy products in the future without hesitation Still has the full framed screen Less chance of damage Great deal Been really happy with the phone does everything I want it to Phone works decent  Battery life was horrible but last update helped with that  Accessing bluetooth and wifi can be a pain unless it auto connects

My biggest issue is the phone is way to fragile  I have never broken a phone and it is always in a case  Screen has broke twice IN MY FRONT POCKET  That is completely unacceptable  I now have the cost of the phone again in 2 screen repairs i love everything about this phone except the screen all phones these days even the S7 have screens that are meant not to crack from certain heights and short ones are not them i dropped my phone Not face down or camera side down on the side from not even 23 ft off the ground and it is now cracked badly and the led display is BROKEN love the phone but i am highly disappointed by the phones glassprotection I have been locked out of my phone for weeks due to FRP even though the phone says in 24 hours  Samsung once again with another great device Large bright display great battery life quick charge great photos Thanks Previously owned an iPhone
Very pleased I bought the S7
Awesome features and support actually cares I was an iphone user for many years This device is truly far more user friendly and far better looking Its a solid product No problems to report so far Fantastic shape love it 1010 would reccomend to anyone I have has this phone for roughly a year and love it My only complaint is the enclosed battery and not being able to replace it Battery life is starting become shorter at a quick pace so i wish it was easily replacable Otherwise phenomenal device I love this phone Its honestly the best phone Ive ever used this phone is not good i has a lot problem with the internet not fine this is my first Galaxy I couldnt be happier The phone is waterproof  easy to use has tons of helpful features and excellent cameralow light  surround sound Pictures and Videos are crisp and high quality  excellent display Not extremely happy with the newest software update 4BQD2 because the font on all the apps is smaller and the icons on updated apps re also smaller But it does have more options I finally upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to a S7 and I am glad that I did The Galaxy S7 has many features that I like I particularly like the stay on always feature I can look at the time without turning my phone on I especially like the color also I have the gold one I recommend anyone to upgrade to the Galaxy S7 if given the chance This phone is something that I would definitely recommend especially over the iPhones So far so good I still have 40 battery life by the end of the day It takes great pictures I was thinking about the s6 when I found out you couldnt use a memory card so I also love the feature of being able to upgrade to the s7 and still use my memory card The only downfall is you cant change the battery once it wears out The Samsung 7 is not my favorite phone I have to click multiple times to make a phone call Cannot find the voice to text feature Not sure what my next phone is but not this one Its just the right size to comfortably hold had physical buttons and an expandable storage Love it I been a samsung guy for sometime and the design is one of the best features about samsung It has been nothing but reliable since the purchase The features are endless and its got so many ways to customize well everything you can imagine This phone is still surprising me and impressing me great buy Also the camera is unbelievable Ive never noticed how poor quality all of my pictures were until comparing them and old photos look like trash The battery life is terrible but otherwise its a good phone mobile gets stucked up charging doesnt last for long time Since I purchased the phone and Verizon assigned me a phone number I have been receiving 100s of spam texts each day and your tech people are unable to do anything about it Cant wait for my contract to end This device is pretty good and it works really well I really like the design and color too The design is a step backward at least in practical terms The Galaxy S5 had a slipresistant back plate that kept my phone from sliding off the nightstand or out of my jacket pocket The S7 might as well be coated in oil Until I got a rubberized case the thing was on the floor as much as anywhere else I guess thats good for Verizon  Samsung if they sellreplace more broken phones right

I like that we have more storage But with every Android update it seems it gets harder to keep it The most recent update no longer enables you to keep apps on the SD card using up more phone space But thats a complaint for Android not the phone This is the go to phone if you have the money my carrier paid for this so I got it If yours does get it Ive owned about 10 mobile phones and this is the first one I have managed to crack the screen It fell about two feet onto pavement when it fell from my pocket My older phones would have absorbed that impact That was several months ago Now it overheats and wont charge via any USB cable that previously worked One time a message appeared about a moisture issue but it appeared momentarily I still have a year left with this overpriced model and it will probably be my last Samsung purchase Ive had it since the day it was released and I absolutely love it  I would definitely recommend this phone to a friend or colleague  The size is perfect not too big or small  Photo quality is excellent for a phone  Battery life is great  Basically anything that can be done on a PC and obviously tablets can be done using this device its productivity potential considering it is only a phone is outstanding It works great for what you spen and it light weight Phone battery would drop in 6 hours after a few months of use even if location and wifi is turned off Drops calls at least once a day There is nothing fancy about this phone but it gives me a lot of problems Not as great as I expected  The phone Constantly freezes up especially when viewing email will not download entire message  just the title have to keep going out and retapping to get message  Sometimes the message never does come up just the title very frustrating   Too many steps to access voicemail if you swipe the notification icon to access the voicemail it will only take you to the premium voice access then you have to decline and start again from the number pad Previous phone would go directly to voicemail  just had to put in password  not have to dial a number then passcode to access mailbox easy to use glad it has no removable battery
i am replacing the S5

I have only had this a few hours and can already see I will enjoy the S7 I have only had this phone for a week and so far I like it a lot But I am missing a feature that I loved on my S5 This was the ability to delay text messages after hitting the send button for up to 30 seconds I appreciated correcting a text message or stopping it altogether in case I was sending it to the wrong person by mistake I wish Samsung would have kept this feature on the S7 Otherwise I like the phone very much Great phone for the price we paid It handles everything I throw at it love this phone its features its design  its ease of use and most importantly its very quick charging and battery life a truly great phone One of the best flagship devices I have ever seen more over the camera is a Killer why dont you try advertising on camera Love this phone Fast and easy to use Only downfall for me is its a little big and difficult to hold with one hand I love everything about this phone I only buy Samsung phones and they are so easy to navigate and apps are awesome I went from a Note 3 to the S7 I was very happy with the Note 3 I thought upgrading to the S7 I would be even more impressed and satisfied but I was definitely wrong I would not recommend this phone to any one I have nothing positive to say about it I would love to return to my Note 3 Samsung has always made great phones but this one is by far the best This cellphone works as advertised and is a good value This is the 3rd Galaxy phone I have had and I am so happy with it It is always easy to integrate all my apps and updating stuff is a breeze I have plenty of space for all my apps and pictures The camera is fantastic as well I have been a Samsung fan for years and I dont plan to stop anytime soon I know the 8 is all the rage now but youd have to pry my 7 out of my cold dead fingers Ive loved this product since day 1 The galaxy s7 is a beast when It comes to performance I have the snapdragon 820 version and the only complaint is have is that it heats up quite a bit But I heard that its just a snapdragon processer issue Other than that the phone is perfect This phone is the worst bad quality breaks easily NOT WATER RESISTANT at all I could go in many details but samsung does not allow that I was a huge galaxy lover but not anymore THANKS SAMSUNG This is an awesome phone no joke I would honestly give it a 5 star rating if I could But there are couple things that quite dont make this a perfect phone First of all the battery drains quite fast More than other phones that Ive used Every time there is an update there seems to be a glitch with samsung The verizon samsung is also SO slow with updates this needs to get fixed Also there are so many useless apps Samsung really needs to remove a lot of their software so that it doesnt use up the space on the phone or at least have the option to remove them completely 

I really like the camera on the phone except when tilted away from the face the selfie looks way too overly stretched Is this a single phone issue or a wide issue not too sure Coming from a different OS I am very pleased with the form and functionality of this phone I would definitely recommend to everyone I am very pleased with my new Samsung 7 My Samsung 4 was still working  but the charging port was damaged so I had no option but purchase another phone At this point I am very satisified with all of the options but still learning I will be returning to the nearby Verizon store to get help figuring out several adjust toitems but overall the phone is fairly easy to I have had three S7s over the last year That says something by itself when I dont normally have phone problems but the S7s beauty does not mean it is tolerant of abuse The first was lost to a drop from a shirt pocket onto concrete No surprise The second was a four inch drop onto asphalt Surprise Didnt think that would be an issue with a tempered glass screen protector but it was just enough to be annoying

Love the display Love the apps Love almost everything about the phone  it really is a good phone people can hear you and you can hear them even under difficult circumstances Connectivity is as good as anything else and the phone has cellular network contact when others do not Love that

My only reason for giving the device less than perfect marks  the screen is too sensitive I pull it out of my pocket even with the pocket protection feature turned on and it is doing things I never asked it to do If I hold it in my hand I will get button presses when I am not even contacting the screen My S5 had a setting to change this sensitivity but the S6 and S7 seem to have forgotten individual people interact differently with different platforms FWIW the fruit devices frequently fail to recognize my touches taps and pounds which is one of the reasons I am a big Samsung fan My sister has the same issue

For everything it does and everything is is highly water resistant sleek design capable I really overall enjoy this phone I just bought an S8 today Hoping Ill be even happier with more screen Time will tell and Ill review the S8 after I have some time with it Great picture and good size screen My son loves it The phone is all the quality you would need in a smart phone  With the new software update there really no flaws to this phone  It has excellent resolution speed multitasking functions withstands the environment outstanding battery life and the way it is built is superior to the touch of your hand Im not a very quick learner when it comes to all these new gadgets and computers especially phones I previously had an iPhone and switched to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and honestly this phone is so easy for me to navigate through and learn how to use I have not found myself getting frustrated like I did wmy previous phones I highly recommend This review was collected as part of a promotion The phone has a lot of issues I have had four phone been replace by my phone carrier because the phone wont not connect to Bluetooth apps wont not be updated software would not be updated will lock it self On the setting the app manager will not be there

I like Samsung product but I think the S7 has not been is good as S5 There were no issues with my S5 If you have an S7 and you are having issues know that you are not by yourself

Whomever created the S7 was nit Phone is nice and has great features except memory Despite not being able to remove the Samsung Pay program and being annoyed by the constant reminder that there are 3 messages in the app Everything else in and on this phone is exceptional I love Samsung phones and other products so I may sound biased but it really is a fantastic device not only will I recommend it I have to numerous people who have traded in their Iphones and other Android devices to go with the Samsung S7 and S7 edge and all are happy I miss my theme and am disappointed in the limited ring choices however appreciate the reliability and performance of the phone The bluetooth is spotty The battery holds little to no charge Buy a better phone for cheaper than this garbage I just love this phone so much the features are amazing Everything about this phone is amazing except for its dependiibilty for the cost I have had an s6 until I got the black screen of death and so I upgraded to a s6 and youll never guess literally the same problem occured And because of the price of the phone repairing it is just as ridiculous not to mention If someone see you with it you better not make a mistake and take your eye off it because itll get stolen  I dont want to be totally negative because besides this one issue my life was amazingly a little less stressfull and easier to manage and thats what I think a smart phone should do This phone has a very good camera so that shooting results more sharp clear and very satisfy me
For the existing sensor on this phone is very adequate with the pulse sensor and fingerprint scanner
Only when the use of heavy loads then the phone will feel hot because until now has not found a processor with very low power and does not cause heat This review was collected as part of a promotion Just when I made my mind up to try another brand Samsung came up with this device Completely love everything about it This phone is by far the worst phone I have ever owned and the is including flip phones I really hope that the Galaxy S8 is better because I will never get another Samsung phone if it isnt Im already nevery going to get another edge phone Most of the time I have to hit the letters more than once to get a letter to register More than several times if it is close to the edges Phone just closes programs or switches programs on its own Scrolls on its own The phone is OK but battery life is relatively short despite making changes to save power For some reason apps launch and play while the phone is in my pocket and it also makes lots of pocket dials 
I also believe it would work a lot better with another provider instead of ATT

On the positive side the phone has a bright screen and the Samsung watchphone that came with it is truly remarkable and works well again except for battery performance This review was collected as part of a promotion This phone was my first intro to the Edge feature The Edge feature has a purpose and I can see the selling point to it but for me it doesnt really serve a purpose I can navigate other ways much faster than using the edge feature It also weakened the durability of the phone I always boasted on the durability of my Galaxy but this version I ran through two in a matter of months due to accidental drops on the edge These drops were with a case on it also so I was a bit disappointed in that When I got my final phone i was very careful with it and it lasted me roughly a year without any breaks cracks or damage As with most Samsung devices the hardware is hard to beat Feels great in the hand heavy yet very lightweight Camera is dynamite video is great Software at times is lacking and sometimes it will lag and drag Its a small price to pay for the allowance of being outside the box ad being able to download apps from anywhere from anyone Unless Samsung does some really messed up stuff like take away the microSD againi waited 2yrs cause i refused to buy the s6 without the microSD Ill always be a Samsung guyI have the s8 early assessmentits awesome I had high hopes upgrading to the S7 from my Droid turbo 2 Before the Droid I had a Samsung S3 The s3 was great because it was seamless Screen brightness notifications calls texts It all just worked and I didnt have to think about it The Droid was fine But it lacked the personalization and simplicity of the s3 I expected the s7 to be like the s3 only better It definitely is not Screen brightness is arbitrary Sometimes blinding sometimes dim to the point of uselessness Some notifications cant be turned off 78 times a day I get forced to attempt to sign in to a random WiFi Hotspot Everything about this phone is mediocre sound quality volume reception functionality none of them live up to the hype In addition to that after the update battery life is significantly worse I should not have to disable or restrict functions to get battery life similar to how it was preupdate The s7 is not the discreet companion the s3 was Its the annoying codependent micromanaging overbearing secretary everyone dreads The only application that kept me hanging on for as long as I did with the S7 was the Camera The different modes to capture photos were absolutely fantastic However that was the only thing and it wasnt enough to convince me that it was a great phone

 I spent two and a half weeks with the device learning the new features with the latest iteration of Samsung and was left wanting Some of the Advanced Settings werent really a game changer that most phones come out with  I wasnt awed I wasnt even impressed

 Unfortunately everyone  I switched back to the iPhone  I think the S7 is an incredibly powerful phone but some areas of the device like GPS and Messaging were incredibly clunky Im not an amateur when it comes to troubleshootingfixing problems so when I spent close to an hour and a half trying to fix my devices GPS location issues which never got solved I decided enough was enough Another thing Battery out of the box the S7 display is set at 2K resolution no matter if youre just messaging or browsing the web here and there your battery gets drained I thought hard on this while you can change the resolution back to FHD then HD  why in the world would you create a device with an amazing screen where the enduser has to suffer I didnt even know about the 2K display until I got the latest android update which looked like the S8 This review was collected as part of a promotion This product has great features and is easy to use I hve not used it yet but it already has an advantage over my s6 total dung heap I love this phone its great best phone i ever had only complaint is it slips out of ur hands so easy i broke my screen Love this phone Great photos plus water resilient Should have IR Worst phone ever As an Apple hater Im ready to switch Along with carrier Upgraded from 6 to 7 worst decision ever WiFi stinks  even in a 400 sq ft apt in France In my own home its not even usable  Takes webpages up to 2 minutes to load unless I stand by router  Half the time the screen froze After new purchase didnt work 6 hours of phone time later  sent a refurbished one Same issues plus contacts wouldnt transfer Two more hours phone  3rd one arrived refurbished Still the WiFi is worthless unless  youre next to the router And verizon wouldnt let me go back to my 6 Pigeon holed into using data or another upgrade And Im only 45 days out Like the Auto application that I can use on my Ford Focus  Appreciate the long battery life Like the larger size Ive only had my S7 for week but so far Ive been able almost everything my S4 did Of course the nuances are a little different and it takes a little getting use to a new phone but I believe I will be pleased with it This review was collected as part of a promotion I owned an earlier version of this phone plus other Samsung products which exceed expectations  Never disappointed by Samsung Previous phone was samsung so it was an easy transition I like the samsung brand Will continue to use samsung Beautiful Phone amazing features love its crystal clear screen sound quality sharp camera Samsung Pay features expandable memory lacked in my iPhone and the list goes on and on I have had 3 of these bought the glass to protect it as well as the case that was suppose to keep it from getting broken and I went through two of them in a week Very fragile phone I love the phone There is just one thing I would change The speaker is at bottom of phone and would like a front and back speaker Too many times the speaker is blocked because is on bottom but it is something I just need to get use to I am amaized at how much it is like my S5 but with so many additional features which are so easy to use  If I have a question I simply ask goodle and usually she comes up with the right answer very quickly  I like it  Still learning I take a lot of photography with a Nikon and I found the pictures I took with this camera did not need any additional processing ie lightroom I would recommend an sd card to store your photos so you dont have to fill up the memory in the phone Fast response decent speakersgreat features 
Battery life  could be better Decent  camera Overall a great phone I would  recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone Like the phone and features but the signal is bad Inside my garage I have one bar on meter Step outside I go to 3 bars never have had a full signal meter I like the pictures and the sound Its different than my S3 so it will take time to figure everything out I like the S7 because it is a good phone lasting out all other I have had in the past battery life could be better but still not bad charges pretty quick with a reg charger This review was collected as part of a promotion Still trying to get use to it 
This is a new learning experience different from my old phone but I will learn over time So easy to learn to use  So many advancements since the Galaxy S2  Many features are a simple oneclick Picture pixels are the best Its super light weight Love the battery durability Great storage this may the the best phone i have ever owned so fast and reliant and darn good looking Good news is the poor battery life kills the phone so fast you dont have to deal with the other issues Biggest issue after battery life is non stop dropping wifi No signal where I work so straight wifi and it drops it at least 45 times an hours Contacted Verizon and they were no help Told me to contact Samsung I didnt buy the phone from Samsung I bought it from Verizon Excellent design easy to usenavigate Quick charging Exceptional camera I like the phone quite well with a couple of small issues  Firstits a dust magnet  Secondcriminals should never own one because it hangs on to fingerprints like a magnet
A big issue  the battery is still no where near as good as promised Being my first smartphone I am very much learning about the phone and features  I am pleased so far and will probably give higher rating when I am more associated with the phone  Im not too happy about the signal strength being 50 less than my 10 year old phone I replaced Simple to use great audio and I love it just like my last one I really with someone would design a battery that kept its charge longer  How about solar powered I like the fact that it charges very quickly I chose the gold which I love I wish it had more of a variety of ringtones to choose from I use the microphone feature a lot and on the S7 it doesnt understand me very well even though I am speaking the same way I did with my S5 and the suggestions for misspelled or misunderstood words are not even close to being relevant  Its very frustrating  On the other hand the charge lasts and everything else is fine Easy transition from Galaxy 3 Data transfer from old device to new device was smooth New functionality not too difficult to master I have not had this new phone for more than One week And have not been disappointed so far I like this phone much better than my old GalaxyS4 The basic operation of the phone is enough like my old s4 that there was no learning curve  I updated to Android 70 a day after I got the phone which presented more of a challenge than the hardware  I havent explored the new features of the camera yet but on the whole it is a better version of the s4 I have been using for 3 years  Note to Samsung put the onoff button on the top of the phone  It is too easy to hit it accidentally  Also I miss the replaceable battery  Hope I dont have a really expensive brick with a 5 minute battery life in 18 months I like the phone but have two major complaints

The first is that I will the screens scrolled continuously  That is a simple fix I wish they made  Now I have to scroll through 4 screens to get to my last screen

The second major issue is the incredibly annoying Flipboard app that is useless but takes away a screen and seems to link only to fake news  After 5 minutes of looking at worthless stories I disabled it but wish I could remove it altogether  The are better news apps but Samsung insists on using this garbage app  Please get rid of it Not what I was expecting after the s6 loved my s6 Was fast and easy to work with The s7 sucks compared to my s6 I hate this phone Completely It lags way bad The only good thing about it is the battery life seems to be better It was an easy move but I do not like the ring tones provided Im trying to voice my own notification ring tones for my my text messages Screen is to small When coming from a note 5But nice phone very happy with Samsung phones all together Nice phone but it has to many built in apps that take up memory When I first got this phone yeah it worked great And then it took a dark turn and it would freeze it wouldnt play videos and I mean videos in my GALLERY not online I couldnt get the screen to turn on this was a month after getting it So sure maybe I just got a defective one So I got a new one since that one was clearly messed up It worked for a while but it just wiped my entire SD card of its data why No idea Just felt like it apparently So 70 of my media is now gone Forever Its also lagging a lot And mind you I dont have a lot of apps on here All I use the phone for is Amazon Music Instagram Facebook texting and calling Thats it Seriously not even games But apparently Im the only one with a bad streak with this phone and now Im stuck with it for another year joy if you dont want hassle avoid this phone Theres plenty more Got this phone new in December  People can not hear me  Say I just fade out plus it sounds like wind blowing when I talk  I can only get reburbished phones which have their own problems  I am on phone 4 If this does not work will just pay off and get something different  I am totally stressed right now about my phone Have visited Verizon about 20 times in last few weeks I upgraded from an S4 and overall am very pleased  The new phone has a couple of additional features I like and it seems to get coverage in areas where the S4 failed to grab a signal  On the down side the look shape and color of some of the standard icons is different and I dont like those changes  Still Im happy I switched and I wouldnt go back The s7 is a pretty good phone I love the camera the battery drains with games but otherwise good I am having a bit of trouble finding my voicemail but just started looking today lol
Fantastic customer service and priducts I like the phone it is what i expected i just feel the prices are to highthe service is great and the people at the stores are wonderful The Galaxy S7 meets my expectations in a phone  The apps are easily accessable The speed is great  The phone is easy to handle and the camera works very well with nice clear pictures Not much of an upgrade from S6 to the S7unfortunately I needed to upgrade and could not wait for the S8 I have no clue what you want here said it all above mmmmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkjjhhggggggggggggggggggg Hard to use at first need class to familiarize self with phone Age may have something to do with it With 4 gb of Ram and the great camera resolution makes better photos and many other features specially with android 70 the screen cracked and I had a screen protector installed at Verizon on day 1 by the salesperson This is an inferior brand of Gorilla glass that Samsung used on the Galaxy S7 I feel sorry for the people that buy the Samsung Galaxy S8 because it has less of a bezel around the screen which means the screen will crack easier Both the S7 and S8 use the same 3000amh battery which will only last me a half of a day before it is completely drained and you cant remove the battery The Galaxy series has gone down hill in performance quality since the s4 I had the least issues with the s4 My s6 was riddled with charging issues the camera quality was terrible and it developed screen burn

Never the less I went with the s7 edge In the 2 weeks Ive owned it I have found that it gets tired easily and everything acts chunky Apps take way too long to respond I am contemplating returning it for a phone that functions better 

The only decent thing so far is the camera has improved The phone is really awesome with cool apps It is really thin and fits great in my pocket The internet is really fast and it takes great pictures even in the dark I was in no doubt in need of an update My old phone was the S4 a week before the S5 came out all those years ago I needed a new cellphone and decided to still stick with the Galaxy and merely got the S7 Its easy to transition to it was simple to use and Im already use to the new features The battery will easily last me throughout my day without me charging it going from 8am in the morning until around 1am the next still having around 20 left even after constant use This is my 2nd replacement I have to turn it off sometimes to dial out phone gets stuck I want my s6 edge back not all of my texts and information transferred over from my old phone to my new one  When i charge it at night the screen turns to a multiple color screen so i have to flip it upside down LOVE MY GALAXY 
I love the design of it and its bright display
Its camera is extremely clear and easy to use
The only problem that I have is that the battery gets used up pretty fast Luckily it comes with onthe go charging pack
Allin all Im really satisfied with my recent purchase
I would definitely recommend this to everyone Just upgraded from a 3yearold Androidsuch an improvement especially the speed of the system and the camera  The battery was being used very quickly until the performance mode was changed from high performance to optimized   thus saving battery power  so Id recommend doing this unless you need ie everything running on your device or things like having the brightest screen at all times  This phone can also be charged wirelessly with a wireless charger that you place the phone on  no connection needed  Have only had the phone 1 week but am happy so far  Only negative is the high cost of this device and lack of a 2year contract which used to keep the price down The only complaint i have is that the phone seems to overheat frequently I Love the phone but due to work I need to use it very often and the battery life in this is just not enough barely lasts me all day  Coming from a pure google experience phone my grips about this phone are mostly the UI software First off the phone performs fairly well it boots up quickly and easily moves from one task to the other My gripes are the ridiculous amount of bloatware from Verizon and Samsung Why do I need two different play stores If Samsung wants to create apps place them in the Google Play store and compete against other developers Please get rid of the double apps I would like to customize the quick tasks better from the notification bar simplify the settings  follow the google template and dont deviate from that
The phone design is good and feels good in hand the display is good and some of the options like the always on display and the performance options are great Great phone with a fantastic screen Fast performance The howto videos in the help section were great in quickly figuring out the things my new phone can do I like Galaxy phones I would buy S7  even though S8 is released I want it and recommend it I dont like iPhone Even though Google Pixel is out i dont like it because it doesnt have that much feature as s7 have I especially like the Performance mode easy to use when gaming switch to gaming mode The security system is the best feature like scanning every app before installing I also like the Swipe Unlocking I mean galaxy phones are best  Randomly rebooting  looking for command Locks up cant be used Called support since Im within my 14 day return policy they ordered me Samsung galaxy s8 for replacement Im pretty satisfied with my Galaxy S7 32G Although I sometimes have to restart it to capture certain info on some apps I love the features on it My favorite is the split screen capability Had a galaxy note 5 went to a s7 much faster and easier to use smaller device feels more comfortable in my hands while still giving the high quality display Holds a charge well Ease of apps and the clarity is great Love the camera and my voice calls come in much clearer I always did like Samsung products with the exception of the galaxy s7 edge I am used to big phone with thick edges It is hard for me and my big fingers to hang on to this phone with its curved edges Otherwise it is a great phone Am hoping that I am able to find a back screen cover and carrying case for this phone The S7 is so close to the S5 that I did have as far as the way the phone works Made it easy to use I love my new Samsung S7  I had an S6 previouslySamsung continues to innovate  Ill upgrade to the S8 in time Im sure  I like the water resistance screen responsiveness  build quality  and performance Love the quality of the pictures it takes  Also the screen is always very clear  I am having fun with the flip camera and the emojis I enjoy all the good  features of the S7I enjoy my Gear VR with my S7My mom likes it my aunt and uncle like it Ive had S7 Galaxy one week  Its a huge leap from my previous phone  My primary complaint is that the screen touch is too sensitive andor it does not take me to where I want to go eg contacts  it goes some where elseso I have to return and try again  The technology assumes I know certain things or   that I like to play as if its a toy  I didnt buy an expensive toy I wanted a useful tool I love Samsung and that is why I always get it but this one has been really slow and laggy Ive had it for about a week and already it cant keep up with my typing and often freezes or wont even let me unlock my phone Im loving the storage and the camera on the Galaxy S7 The phone is the perfect size and it has good accessories Alarm doesnt work so Ive been late for work almost every day Ive tried 4 different apps and none of them have worked This is a basic phone function All of the forum discussion Ive read online tell me there is no fix for it Samsung suggests many work arounds that work for a couple times but then the alarm stops working again Also the notifications for the calendar alerts are hit or miss I rely on these for work and am very frustrated when they are not functioning properly I got this phone as a replacement phone after my previous phone broke and so far I am extremely disappointed Just upgraded to this phone from an S4 and it was well worth the investment 
The most immediately notable feature is the camera which has been made easier to use and has significantly improved performance particularly in low light Im able to get clear sharp pictures in a dimly lit living room without having to tweak the camera  just pick up and shoot 
Im also happy with the addition of easilyaccessed slow motion video since its super useful for sports 
The second innovation I love is the popout drawer on top for the sim  SD card Ive always disliked having to pry the back off my phone and fiddle about near the electronics to access those Im a bit ambivalent about not being able to access the battery but I have several friends who use and love the S7 and theyve assured me its not a problem and of course thats offset by knowing the phone should be able to hold up to use outofdoors  something thats important to me since I hike geocache and do outdoor dog sports I use Otterbox cases but the phones builtin resistance to water and dust is a big plus
I also really like the splitscreen feature and the quick access to recently used apps 

The only reason I havent given the phone 5 stars for everything is that I do have the Verizon version which has had some of the softwareUI features removed or hidden The Samsung S7 is a very solid well built phone  Its all metal with solid switches
The max microSD cap is 200 GByte which San Disk produces  The battery is not replaceable so getting an ANKER 10000 mAHour external battery was a logical choice for me this battery is cheap at Amazon
I cannot sort my music by date cause unknown  I take the SAME microSD disc with the songs and insert into the OLD Samsung S4 and sort by date works  I relocate the disc to the S7 and the sort by date doesnt work correctly  Phone or PlayerPro
Still I love the phone  Its very fast I know it isnt the latest version of the Galaxy my phone broke before the release of the 8 but I expected it to run faster than my Galaxy S6 Edge It still is nice and everything but the slowness is so apparent Really like the s7 just wish it had a longer battery life Just upgraded from an S5 to the S7 Very sleek design easy to use Love it Bought the unlocked version I was deciding between edge and regular version After seeing many reviews I decided to stay with the regular version which seems to have more favorable reviews than the edge I have a Samsung Smart TV and also a 122 Galaxy tablet besides the phone I really like that they work together I can mirror the phone or tablet to the SMart TV which I use all the time

The phone has good battery life when setup correctly Touch screen works well and seamlessly 
Like all phones I get nervous about durability so got a heavy duty case for it Previous Samsung gearTVs and in particular my 122 Galaxy tablet have proven to be long lived and problem free so hoping for the same from this S7 phone It is easy  to use Has sharp pictures Good  ring tones to choose from  and notification sounds are different which I like I have used Samsung cellular phones for a number of years now The Galaxy S7 is the fastest and most featurefilled of all of its predecessors Although some reviewers have a hohum attitude to the improvements apparently expecting lifechanging transcendence in each new release I simply appreciate the ways that Samsung makes its product better usually

It is however noticeably thicker than the 6 and a little heavier or so it seems to me The Galaxy S7 is a handsome device and packed with many useful features  But there are three concerns of mine 1 The phone only provides 32GB memory onboard most of which is taken up by the operating system and some unneeded apps Even though the phone accepts a micro SD for added storage most available apps cant be stored  to the SD card 2 The micro SD card slot is mounted on a difficulttoretrieve flat ejectable surface along with a slot for the tinier SIM card As a result both are susceptible of falling and getting lost Replacing the two cards requires much dexterity as well  3 The brief instruction pamphlet is practically useless and unless one wants to spend much time in discovering by trial and error as to what the phone has to offer a comprehensive PRINTED user manual should be included The phone was for my husband and he seems to like it  Its just hard for him to relearn since he had his last phone for 5 years haha This is a great phone that does everything  It takes amazing pictures and with HD Voice and Video Calling its like talking with someone face to face  I optimized the display to preserve on battery but the quality of the display is still awesome Insert an SD card to greatly expand storage capacity  The only negative is syncing email calendar and contacts with Exchange is a battery drain  I had to sync my exchange work email through Gmail which solved the battery drain problem 4 times each day i am alerted to new software update Verizon tech help wasnt able to direct me Taking back to store to see if they can figure out how to stop this nagging problem Phone works well and was easy to learn the new features Had a Samsung galaxy s5 before Like all of the storage for my pictures which are very good The only thing I am not liking is sometimes the screen seems non responsive and others it is too sensitive Very happy with my S7 I had an S4 and I was able to transfer 90 of the information I had on my S4 with little to no trouble because of Cloud and direct transfer Great phone great features with a lot of storage They get better every time Completely disappointed with the functionality battery and updates I regret going back yet was so excited to I cant complain about this S7 The transition to it was easy Samsung keeps the operating system very similar while creating a superior product Im very hapy This is by far the best Galaxy phone It is a full feature packed device The camera is great the water and dust resistance makes you worry less to carry your phone with you even in bad weather The only downside I felt was with the inbuilt memory maybe a 64 GB variant would have made me happier Also the phone seems to be delicate because of the glass surfaces so be careful if you opt not get a cover for this one Great phone A lot better than my old phone Many new features I dont know how I ever lived without it It is a vast improvement from my last phone Im sure Ill have many years of enjoyment using my new phone Every thing I ever  wanted in a phone Easy to use Set up great The smartest smartphone Ive ever had Was expecting bigger screen an more sound picture was very nice Service is very good an data speed is nice i like verizon but just the phone i have im not satisfied with Perfect phone Nothing left to say Had a galaxy grand forever and having this phone makes my old phone look ancient Super responsive great phone The Galaxy s7 is everything you want in a phone Stylish quick and backed up by the VZN just one word awesome Always reliable  Phones are excellent and have never had any issues with them lasting a long time  Verizon reps are very knowledgeable I just upgraded from a S4 to the S7 Overall the phone is great but there are some things about the S4 that Samsung should have left alonenamely the calendar I use the calendar a lot for work and personally The calendar on the S4 was great and Samsung should have left the format alone The format of S7 calendar is unusable Since getting the phone a couple weeks ago I have read many reviews online stating the same thing that I am saying I downloaded another calendar app but its still not as good Please make the S4 calendar format an option on the S7 Please Im begging you It was so much easier to use Also bring back the weather graphics please Besides these items the phone is heavy I really wish the weight was a lot less than it isno one wants to carry around a heavy phone This Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone  I have had no problems with it and expect that it will fulfill all my needs  The camera resolution is especially outstanding  The detail is amazing  and the slow motion and fast video are a welcome addition Superb phone with ample features Beautiful design and userfriendly configuration Outstanding sound quality and best in class photo quality and display This review was collected as part of a promotion I love my new galaxy s7 It is a fantastic phone and very user friendly I also love the great customer service that Verizon has and the Tech Coach app is great Still learning but so far I love it Had a pretty old phone so all the new features are great  Time will tell My prior phone was a Galaxy S4 so a lot of the features were similar or enhanced Very user friendly The phone gets really hot on the wireless charger There was no discoloration on the case but there is a diagonal hairline crack across the middle of the screen Was nice until last software upgrade now it sucks Dont understand why what they think are improvements are always worse Still learning all the features Have no issues at this time The S should have some improvements but the S7 for the price serves my purpose Buy a case It will not only provide improved protection but will make the phone easier to handle  hang on to Love my Galaxy S7  They just keep getting better love all the new features Picture quality is  Finger scanning has really improved fr0m my s6  Love my Galaxys I am very pleased with my new Samsung S7 I was in need of an upgrade  thought about going straight for the S8 but to save myself some money I went with the S7 ad am very content with my choice The functionally is great and I am really enjoying the camera features It will be an excellent addition to my regular camera on an upcoming trip i have planned I have had problems finding a phone that will work in my house and this phone is great Ease of use pictures and expandable memory are great I am still trying to figure out some of the things on my phone but am really happy with it   There are a lot of features I dont need and need to turn off updates to them  I am not that tech savvy so if I cant figure it out I will contact someone to help Right after we ordered phone I mean the next day S8 was advertised should of had option of going to s8 Its really great  The charger is much better than other chargers I have used The camera and sound quality are excellent  This phone is easy to use and is a good size for phone games Would not purchase this phone  The phone over heats too easily  It looses battery power really fast  Camara  is bad They already swapped out my phone once and it didnt change a thing The keyboard is very difficult to use it is smaller than the S5
Things just randomly stopped working Its fast and bright and easy to use The camera is so easy to access One charge last me 24 hours and recharge takes only about two hours I love my new Galazy S7 So far its been a great phone with lots of great features The battery life is long the screen crystal clear There are a few things that i miss on my old Galazy that this one doesnt have The alarm where you can talk to it and say stop or snooze is not on this new phone The lady was very helpful
The phone is very nice and almost the same as my old phone the only downside is the have to be back the the micro memory card Good product Easy to figure out extremely simple self explanatory Small design with great picture 1st one had an issue with battery charging to 100  Returned it the next day and this one works great  Love the camera  Love that the battery seems to last longer  Got this one on the recommendation of a friend and so glad I did A bit different from an I phone but just as functional The clarity of the screen is great pictures are awesome and its easy to use once you get used to it Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7  The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4  The only con that I have is the curved surface and slim design make it very hard to securely hold the phone  I definitely recommend getting a protective case for it In my entire life used Samsung Products but now I have a a lot of problems whit my phones the lcd and batteries are not good you need to do something because I like Samsung but we need to check these thanks The phone itself is fantastic I love Samsung The only real draw back is the glass on both sides because it makes the phone very slick I would highly recommend getting a case when you buy the phone I had it for 3 days and accidently dropped it because it slippery I am used to the s5 active which had a rubber back Other then that I love this phone The keys at the bottom of the screen are very sensitive so be careful of that I like all the features great design great Network thats all thats all I have to say about that I would recommend to a friend Phone is great The guy at Costco that help me exchange the iPhone I had bought a week prior was really helpful Love this phone work well and is easier to use than the s6 I wish I had bought an iphone  This phone makes no sense in comparison  My mistake  Set up at the store doesnt work cant get my email  Confusing as to how to get apps on the screen  I hate it Replaced my S5 Very pleased with the S7 nice features easy to use I love this phone Fast Charging wifi calling and a great camera make this the best phone ever Works 10 times easier than the 6 edge I had The speed of phone is excellent and graphics if great  This phone has a very high quality camera for a mobile device Naturally it does not replace a device created solely for picture taking however its camera produces high resolution photographs for both everyday use and to a rather high degree a more expansive range of photography Ive had the Samsung 5 Ive had the Samsung 6 and never had an issue I upgraded to the Samsung 7 Edge and I had to replace this phone through warranty three times third time wasnt a charm because now Im having issue with the third phone network issue they say the worst ever I will not be getting another Samsung I love my new Galaxy S7 so far I had the Galaxy S5 before and I love this phone so much more The content transfer from one phone to the other was super easy and so far everything has been working great For the most part Im happy with it  It would be nice if the email application were compatible with my companys email server but other than that Ive been pleased This phone is definitely a better phone than the S6and I was not disappointed in that one  The speed is impressive and the touchscreen is very fast and accurate  I am also pleased that it comes in goldmy favorite color I LOVE MY S7 EDGE I LOVE THE GOLD AND IT IS SLEEK I dont need a lot of features but the Galaxy has some really useful tools The fingerprint security is a little finicky to use This is a great phone for me and what I need to do I enjoy the flexibility size features availability quick charging look and feel I am an avid galaxy user The 7 has given me mostly no issues After having it for 10 months though Ive noted it gets quite warm during use at time and battery life has started to decrease Obviously smart phones need a glass digitizer but this phone is inexplicably made entirely of glass And while the camera disposition is improved since the s6 it still protrudes in a manner that almost guarantees you will break the glass on it Battery life is slightly improved over the s6 but again insufficient I upgraded from an S5 and there are significantly better features on the S7  The upgraded operating system makes it more responsive The smaller size makes it easier to carry A great phonelove the improvements the battery life is great alsoshowing it to all my friends I love my phone its so quick and fast Ive had nothing but samsung for the last 8 years and they have never failed me Good phone but the keyboard is too small for me since i was used to a larger Samsung phone Also is drops the wifi signal even thought I am in my house or office The headphones that came with the phone never worked so I need to put in a service request It is easy to transfer info from one phone to another I love the versatility of this phone is outstanding It is very competitive with an Iphone I will get another if needed I like the phone but I see minimal difference to my S5 More memory is a huge plus I didnt go with the edge because I dont stream video much so the edge wasnt worth the money Wish the phone was larger like the note I received this phone as a replacement for my S6 edge when its screen spontaneously cracked I used my phone for everything including running my small business so switching was nervewracking All in all the transition went smoothly only a few things I would like to point out apparently the S7 does not have an IR blaster which the S6 did apparently so peel remote wont work on my nonsmart TV Also as much as anyone loves a bigger screen the phones keep getting bigger and bigger and my small hands arent growing anytime soon Some improvements are the quality of the camera ability to add a SD card and the sound quality for music Awesome phoneI have no issues with it My S7 Edge runs great I put in a 120GB SD card  rotate between two cases The Spigen Case Thin Fit accentuates the shape of the phone  UAG Composite Case is perfect for any type of adventuring Despite some trouble getting it activated mostly it was because of the troublesome Experia phone I was upgrading from it has been great  Features are nice camera is beautiful and its got everything I wanted  Very happy i have had my new phone for 3 weeks and  drops always drop  have tried being on and off WiFi and still the same problem  Phone is beautiful but very poor performance  I had a Samsung note four for 2 years and that phone was great If you love Samsung phones then this phone is for you But if you like software updates available memory and apps not notifying you every hour about some Verizon or Samsung product then this phone is not for you The phone seems to be responsive for the most part For some reason everything slows down when you try and take a picture It takes at least 30 45 seconds for the Bluetooth to connect to any device Also the UI is touchwiz which is still completely horrible 2 years ago bought S6  Day 16 it crapped out  Could not exchange bc Verizon only gives you 14 days to exchange  Had to send in for a refurb   Refurb phone died in less than 2 years    Just bought S7 and having problems again  Notifications not being sent  Finger touches delayed or not at all  Im done with Samsung Traded Droid Turbo 2 because after every download it would begin to shut off and battery would get very hot After second reset of phone I decided to trade in and get the S7 Going to return after first week due to weak battery and overall not satisfied with smaller phone size and constantly having to change screen due to accidentally touching the screen and causing actions I did not want Going to get a larger phone like the Edge or the Plus for better battery and handling Ive had a Galaxy for 6 years now and they just get better and better The S7 edge looks incredible feels incredible and its performance is second to none I like to push my phones to the limit and so far my 8 month old phone works like its brand new Would recommend it to anyone This phone has been nothing but problems since it was purchased Half the screen freezes and refuses to work 75 of the time U have had to reset it numerous times in order to get it to work again If I use this phone the way I want to the battery goes from 100 to 20 by the end of the afternoon It means keeping the charger or Mophie close by This has been my experience w several Samsung Galaxy phones 

I use a lot of apps  I bought it for the split screen  floating app capability These features work but they are cumbersome to get to And the screen size makes them cramped Using the split screen feature causes some of the apps to hang  require a phone restart 

Display is sharp  clear Camera is good  easy to access Phone calls are good quality regular speakerphone or Bluetooth 

My recommendation comes w qualifications Nice features on the phone I am having poor quality of service and am hoping that doesnt last forever  Could be the phone but right now when I make some calls the peros cannot understand what I am saying  I then have to call back on my home phone and then works fine The Galaxy 7 has proven to be an easy upgrade from my Samsug S5  The data transfer went well  Tech support has been a added benefit that has help me make the transition and learn where and how to find the settings and apps I needed  The battery gets quite hot at times of heave usage but neve to hot to hold my phone The battery life is terrible it just closes my apps without any notice it is not user friendly  I will be going back to an Apple iphone and may get a deal through Target or Walmart I would definitely recommend this phone to someone it works great The phone is pretty good but Ive had to return it twice because the battery gets so overheated when its charging AND the battery doesnt stay charged for very long I love the S7 but within the first 4 days of having it the phone froze on a white screen with verizon and 4 dots going across the screen It was very irritating but after that caused my phone to die I charged it and it went back to normal Not sure why it happened it was fully charged before it happened Id recommend the S7 but make sure to have a back up in case Rather its listening to music or needing information or needing to capture a simple moment my s7 hasnt disappointed Ever since day 1 it still stands strong in competition with other phones I had a galaxy 7 note that I needed to return on recall I traded for the 7 edge I thought Id be disappointed I was not It is a nice alternative I would recommend this phone to everyone I know easy to use takes the best pictures ever clear as day
Try the Galaxy S7 for a day  Before the day is over you will be buying one Upgraded from S4 to S7  Appreciate the new found speed and memory as well as the improved photo quality  Sound is better just an all around better phone Functionality is great  the screen and notifications are much too small  I work on my phone so the size os making it pretty difficult There are good points and not so good points as far as the overall design sensitivity etc qq Gets very hot frequently Still a bit early for me to a full rating Phone works great and have some good features The pictures are clear and can save more pictures on phone Just wish screen could be bigger like the galaxy 8 Samsung Galaxy S7 battery life is horrible I was talked into this by the salesman and Im very disappointed So I always grew up with android operating system so I was really excited to get a phone with it And I always loved Samsung so it was a perfect match for me I love the design the smooth performance the special edgeonly features and the storage Especially the storage I was always one of those people who use a lot of storage so upgrading from a 48 GB phone to a 32 GB phone was a great feeling To me Samsung is the best brand I have a gold platinum s7 edge and it is amazing Totally recommend PS You can drop this thing 10 million times and it will never break My new Samsung Galaxy S7 is a very good cell phone The camera takes excellent photos Apps are well placed Plenty of storage Fits nicely in my pants pocket Reception is crystal clear I was way overdue for a new phone It was an easy transition from my Samsung Galaxy 5  I love the new features especially the ones for the camera The screen size is perfect for onehalf use I do not like the way the glass screen protector fits on the Galaxy S7 The glass doesnt stick to the outer edge of the phone and will eventually peel up more  I do however the the camera love the camera on the phone as well as some other simple things Great features and smooth transition from previous phone to new phone  Plus sales representative very pleasant and knowledgeable and worked with us on the billing I do not get very good service at my house or when traveling a lot of the features are too hard to use battery life is too short takes too long to charge the camera work good its easy to send picture messages The keyboard options are limited Its different from what I am used to and I am hoping that it proves to be reliable and a good decision but it is too soon to know print is small by default Once font was adjusted it messed messenger up Not impressed with the sound Especially playing music or even streaming or facebook voice Turned up all the way and you still have to almost put it to your ear Phone audio is ok though Nice upgrades to my last phone the S4 Easier to access settings and all apps in the app manager Text messages a little confusingmore than one app for texting or cloud saving is not necessary Google and Verizon both should not need to store infopick one and stick with it I l8vd the phone just tends to get hot sonetimes This phone is a great buy with great features and a really good camera The sound is loud and clear and there are many really good features This phones functions like my laptop I can do all the things i do on my laptop on this smartphone including print I would definitely recommend this smartphone Nice product except for the fact that out the box there have already been issues with the screen Good thing Im within my exchange period The S7 is much faster and better megapixels on the camera than my previous S5 Love it Still has the swipe feature excellent Upgrades are great fingerprint password microphone placement  no more cover for the charging cord Nice sleek phone with many features      Greatcamera and like the visual voice plan Love the gold colorvery classy The battery gets hot fastotherwise I love this phone better than I did my iphone Coming from Galaxy S5 which had rubber I am finding the S7 too delicate and slippery The screen is less responsive than the S5 Dumb things such as stopwatch stopping if you need to darken the screen while the phone is in your pocket make the feature totally useless And it was something that worked perfectly in the S5 Good phone for work  I wish they come with a bigger screm as Well but good in overall  Recomended Everything on this phone is better Even the battery life I guess I should have upgraded my phone a long time ago I would recommend this phone to anyone Still working out the kinks to making this new phone mine but I am loving it so far   It is lighter  love the bigger screen This phone is very easy to useI am not good with technology but Im pleased with everything so farTheres a couple questions I have but I will go inside the store for helpIm extremely pleased thus far Love this phone A great upgrade compared to my old iPhone The overall features of this phone are very good so far as it is still new to me and I am still getting familiar with all the featuresThe overall performance is quick and responsive So far I am very happy with the performance I am still getting used to the phone and Android operating system I came over from a ape iPhone iOS and still taking me a while to get used to this phone Im very please with this phone because its easy to use app features is good texting is very good no compliments about that and takes very good pictures im very please with this phone Different than the note 5 I had Smooth running phone many updates clear photos no concerns yet Outstanding performance  Loads all need apps with no difficulty Great 4G reception
 I went straight from the S5 to the S7 Edge and Im regretting it Im not a fan of the rounded edges of the screen I dont even use the extra features that come along with the edges I like how big the display is and the camera is great I dont like how fragile the phone is due to the odd screen shape I have yet to crack the screen but Ive cracked a couple of tempered glass screen protectors least they did their job I do have a case but I feel its still not that much more protective I wouldnt recommend it but maybe you might prefer the edges features more than I do I love my new phone Im technologically challenged and its fairly user friendlyEven though Im still learning I love this new phone Great Phone and Great Service from Verizon in East Hanover  I highly recommend both   Will definitely buy from the again Too expensivenetwork needs to lower their plans Probably will switch in the near futureif other networks can do it so can Verizon New phone so far works great still too new to see if any problems Do like it so far  would recommend No complaints so far  Still learning Meets or exceeds my expectations  Takes a beating and keeps on running Was easy to set up had no junk apps installed Screen is a little small My old phone was much bigger This phone is great It is sleek not too big and bulkyIt has a great camera which was an important factor for me System updates I still have to figure out all its features I find it uses more GB faster then my previous phone Ive had to add more GB within 1 week of purchase Much happier with battery life This has been a fantastic phone It is my first Samsung phone and I do not have any complaints The best part is the fast charging of the battery I will be at 20 and be back at 100 in half an hour or less Good battery lifebut like size of Note4 better I have owned at least 3 other Samsung phones but this was not at all intuitive  The email font is so small that even with glasses I can barely read it  It has icons that I dont want but cant delete  connecting to wifi outside of my own home was ridiculous I was one of about five people in the world still using a Nokia Windows phone  I really liked that phone  Phones have come a long way in 4 years  I dont want to really find out but I am glad it is water resistant Love the phone especially since my Galaxy S6 took a lot of abuse from dropping the phone etc Very easy transition to the S7 Camera is excellent plus the ability to expand the storage with a micro SD card is a nice feature The phone is aesthetically pleasing It is very user friendly I only wish the battery lasted longer Love the Galaxy S7 Features are awesome Load times are great Screen is the perfect size I do wish the back wasnt glass I didnt realize it was a glass back when I ordered it and didnt find out until I cracked it the first time I dropped the phone from about 2 feet within 2 hours of having the phone it fell out of my pocket onto the ground from the seat of my car I had ordered a protective case but it hadnt shown up in the mail yet but I need the phone for work so I carried it I am a late adopter updating from an S3 Mini I love the added features and speed It was an easy transition to switch phones with all the additions being intuitive and easy to discover I am still discovering and delighted when I find another feature that makes life easier I previously used a Galaxy 4 so this was easy to learn and use right away The camera is a thousand times better than the G4 I have lost a lot of functionality I once had system appears to operate slower  Maybe its just a learning curve but I feel like I have lost a lot of what I once had  Battery life not impressive although I love the wirelessportable charger  Camera is good and the phone looks very nice I had a samsung 4s mini  I miss some of the features that came on my old phone especially the microphone on the key pad so I could talk text Also it had a voice recorder on it  This one doesnt have some convenience of my old phone  However I do like the s7 very much This phone is slow and drags when running certain apps I do like the Phone and I am happy to be back with Galaxy but I was hoping for better performance I love the battery lifecamerastorageand Verizon network Since I got a new phone it seem like my connection got even better I like this new phone so far Much much better than my old galaxy 4 Excited to use my new phone next week on vacation I like all the features that i can use as in the colorful backgrounds of texts  very easy to use  i like that the phone is very slim not heavy  so many new things that im finding just exploring the phone Works great and fast and meets my satisfaction O always been a Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite product Batter never charges over 74 and phone dies ridiculously fast Took it to try and get it fixed but nobody could even figure out what the problem was This is the best phone that Ive ever had I accidentally drop in the dishwater and it stayed dry 

BUY THIS PHONE FOLKS Love the fingerprint and love the screen and love that I can do different themes on it and then virtual reality is amazing on it Pretty good needs a little work needs music app would like to have the remote back and the unlock effects and few more things please quit taking all these great features Phone has a lot of great featurescameraeasy to use once you get to know the phone The only option I dont have is adding a picture from the text windowyou have to go to gallery Then pick one to send I had the Galaxy S3 over 2 years ago it was a great phone I like to change things up so I went with a motorola My brother and his girlfriend both have the S7 and when asking for input on which phone I should get  next they said s7 Ive been incredibly disappointed with it since I received it about a week ago The battery drains way too fast for example Ill wake up with it fully charged Ill visit some social media sites and within the hour it drains to 70 Okay whatever a lot of apps are running I keep my phone in my locker at work and by the time I get to it at the end of the day its down in the 20s Not only does the battery not last but the performance has been slow It lags during videos Im watching it even happened recording one recently and in general will just freeze on the apps Im using I cant help but get frustrated anytime I pick up my phone and wish I had ordered something different I really like my Galaxy s7 its easy to use love the size The applications are easy to load and use Just getting to know the features I just received my Galaxy S 7 yesterday Upgraded from a HTC 9 Which I hated from day one So far Im loving it So much more clearer and takes great pictures So far so good Smaller than I imagine but everything you would require in a smartphone Getting use to the feel is taking some time but worth it Features can be lost because of the number of them but treasure when you discover them On occasions it tend to slow down processingamd would have liked the ability to swap out batteries Overall I give it 4 and 78 stars out of 5 One weekbattery is what I notice mostawesome longevity  Dont like the small keyboard but adjusting  Only option Ive found so far for that is the ugly colored larger Samsungs website alleges that you will be able to unlock your phone remotely once you lock it remotely This is not the case Samsung with powerful wisdom has not come up with a way to unlock your phone without physically keying in a code to the phone So if you break your screen do not lock your phone through find my mobile webpage There is not a way to unlock it yet Alternatively if the phone is still working and the screen is locked that does not allow you to use the APP Kies plug headphones into the phone that can accept a call call the phone and answer it with the headphones The screen will unlock I am having trouble holding it  its smaller its slippery to hold Dropped it once already the protective screen cover cracked but not the screen thank god My Galaxy S5 was textured so easily held And having a lot of trouble txting Very frustrating Love the extra storage space just wish the apps didnt keep crashing and I also wish the battery lasted longer It was easy to set up and use all of the features  Using the camera is much easier than my previous phone Many of the features were the same as my old phone but with many improvements I would like it if music could be easily shared from my laptop computer files but no phone today can do that This phone is like other Android devices easy to use and wasnt hard to switch brands  The camera is a lot better than I expected which is a huge plus I went from the S5 to the S7 and expected the phone to be larger but it wasnt I guess that shouldnt be something Im disappointed about but I kind of am But once I got all my apps and contacts etc downloaded its a very nice phone Response times are quite speedy and the battery life is WAY BETTER Im on day 3 without charging but I think this will be it 
One large complaint  all the exterior surfaces of this phone are too slick As in you can barely hold onto it  seriously There is NO WAY you can operate this phone without a separate case I opted for the Speck case and its working quite well but it would be nice if it wasnt so absolutely necessary 
Some of the features that I had on the S5 that are similar but not exactly the same
1 when turning the phone on there is a sideswipe required before the security screen I dont really understand why The security screen is the same function so why the need for the swipe too
2 My S5 recognized when you were in a familiar location and would bypass the security screen The S7 started to do that but then stopped for no apparent reason Ill have to chat with Service to figure out how to enable that feature because all my efforts to figure it out on the Settings screens have been for nought
3 Love the camera and the fact that you can quickly access it by pressing the home key twice is great On the S5 it took forever to get to the camera This is a great improvement on the S7 Needed a good camera to take pictures of snakes I dont have a home phone so I need a reliable cell phone Had my phone for 2 weeks had it in my purse  Drop my purse went to use my phone and it was cracked on the back and the camera lens was also broken And your not able to get the back off yourself So Im not happy with this phone Being a long time iphone user I was somewhat skeptical of an android device I wish I would have made this switch years ago I love this phone and how easily it syncs with my windows computer I am able to get more work done and that helps me avoid stress The picture and video quality is really top notch I also use the phone as my portable jukebox I have recently added the Gear2 watch and it has made the phone all the better It helps me track my fitness and health data with very little effort Way to go Samsung

Bill So far I am enjoying my new Galaxy S7 32GB I like the idea I can expand the device storage by adding a SD card this way I can keep the device HD mainly for operational programs I like to use the SD card for music videos and pictures The videos and pictures are clear great camera The slim look is another feature I like and I find the phone not too bulky I believe its a good buy This review was collected as part of a promotion The phone itself isnt bad but having converted from a Windows Phone the Android interface is too much like iPhone and most apps are requesting access to things it doesnt need access to  If Samsung produced a Windows phone again I would switch back in a heartbeat I have this phone stunning performance but their are some software problems with the phone Always loved Samsung products They are built to last work as described and user friendly Cant get much better than this phone I went from a Samsung galaxy s4 active to the s7 and I was lery Usually when I upgrade i find all kinds of bugs but so far it has been a present experience No problems the look and feel of the phone is great I couldnt be happier I really hate Android My wife and I do not use a phone as an entertainment device So all the STUFF is overly complicated Everything that used to take on tap now takes three because you have so many options for every command  The size is fine and the graphic resolution is nice but I really miss just being able to make a phone call Or send an email  
I also hate having to charge this thing every day too The battery life socks It said it could work for three days on a single charge I cant get a full day out of it We got a new app and both myself and my husband hate it It makes creating a contact much more difficult You have to call the number to be able to then create a contact 
It also is not very easy to use the call part of the app It says RECENTS and CONTACTS The recents makes no sense I know what it is the term is just so incorrect
I also do not like how it looks Too much too confusing on one page
My husband uses his phone a lot more than I do He games and other things and he really hates the new app I had a Samsung Galaxy phone and lost it recently  Replaced it with the S7 version and am very disappointed in the battery life  The phone holds a charge for 7 hours  Ive used the guide to deactivate battery draining apps running in the background reduced my email sync time and deactivated my location finder and still have battery issues  I wanted to try the new Google phone but the Verizon sales staff was so unhelpful I just ended up with this phone Shuts off randomly pictures blurry hopefully I can exchange it without getting stuck with a bunch of fees This phone is even better than my last Samsung  Much more responsive much better graphics easier to use  Wider and stronger and I can take it out in the rain Samsung changed things that I feel didnt need changing and just made it more complicated to figure out I wish the calendar would allow me to select a date either in the past or future At least I havent figured it out if it does Very good security on this phone So good in fact that I could not get back into the phone It seemed a nice phone but it is of no use if I cannot actually use it I will not get another Samsung Android Google phone Didnt think I would find something I liked less than the iPhone but I did Great phone Love the service with Verizon Much better than previous carrier Also I was very surprised to find out that customer support technicians are actually based here in the US and not oversees Big plus Thanks Phone gets hot battery will not last 6 hours wo recharge All background applications off Phone is also hard to hold without a protective case I like the phone and features It fits my lifestyle and technical savvy Mostly I have enjoyed the overall experience with Verizon I find that I use the phone less frequently than the Samsung S5 due to the fact that I find the newest software update to be very user unfriendly I purchased the phone on 3182017 and liked how it looked and worked When I went to the free Samsung class on 325 the instructor updated my software to the newest version Im frequently told by the experts at Best Buy that the newest software offers so much more But every user is not a sophisticated user who cares for or uses all the bells and whistles I did return to the Best Buy store on 326 to see if I could go back to the software version originally on my phone but was told that was not possible Too bad Buttons are in terrible positions no matter which hand I grab it with I end up pushing a button Not easy to turn off alarms or answer phone calls Really liked my galaxy S5 phone and the Galaxy S7 was a great transition phone for a newer phone Does everything as my S5 with similar setup but better hardware and great phone I upgraded to the s7 after having the Core Prime for about a year and half The transition couldnt have been any easier and I am happy to have a great quality phone with plenty of room for the apps I need I am planning to get a 128 gb memory card so that I can put all of my music podcasts and audiobooks on the phone too The price was a bit daunting but if this phone lasts 3 years I can justify the price Great phone very fast downloads and installs as well as uninstalls
My only gripe is the size I had the Note4 before upgrading and I loved that phone with its pen I only upgraded because the Note4 battery was shot Really have not had this phone long enough to check out all of its features but so far so good I liked my old phone a Droid Turbo 2 better from the start but I hope this phones battery will last more than 1 year Its a good phone I just really loved my motorola phones and the galaxy is a bit different Love all about it Everything is is easy to use and understand  Functions are user friendly Great phone I love all the features of my s7 except for one or two There is a screen that pops up right after a screen shot is taken that is annoying Also the cartoon filter in the camera is gone like the s6 had I loved that feature None that I need to mention None that I need to mention None that I need to mention None that I need to mention Kissed my iPhone 5c goodbye and never looked back Im enjoying a bigger screen and better camera So nice Had to return and go back to a new Iphone I know it is an issue with the Samsung because inside a vehicle with my daughter she was getting good reception with an Iphone but I had nothing but no signal issues Phone has a lot of nice features that make it a good upgrade from my Galaxy S4  Battery life is better and the camera is great This phone is very comfortable and has very features I like it But most of times getting heat without a reason I couldnt play games and smart view on TV since getting very heat I like my Samsung But battery is always a disappointment  I am probably a heavy userbut why should I be judge for it
Battery life 8hrs max It has bright display and beautiful colors Fits easily in my wallet Not durable for construction work battery only holds 24 hrs charge touch screen on edges very sensitive Super glad i made the switch I love the new phone and new service Too many years paying too much Love the customer service as well Easy to use very handygood features great size beautiful pictures a large storage waterproofgreat phone Was very happy that everything that I actually wanted to keep on my old phone transferred so easy to the new one AWESOME pictures as well Great features and Beautiful too Love the camera and battery life is great Would recomend this phone to everyone Text video was less than expected Emails calls sound speed pictures are all excellent Battery life is poor compared to the Droid turbo 2 that I came from but is much more user friendly than the Motorola Happy Samsung Galaxy 7 customer here Very quick customer support If purchased or switched the value does not depreciate The photos are amazing Solid phone that will last but probably not the most price efficient This review was collected as part of a promotion The design is beautiful and hardware specs top notch Im not a fan of the Android OS though and find it lacking in fluidity design and integration It feels like a patchwork of capabilities that have been glued together Nougat has refined a lot but still a long ways to go for Android I previously had a S6  One of the new features this phone has is the  memory card for pictures makes it super easy to transfer your vacation pictures  It is a little bit smaller then my last phone which I likeeasier to handle  There is nothing I dont like about this phone The phone is to small compared to what I had before and really does not cut the musturd I really thought it would have been okay but it is not Apps are slow to start compared to my other phone  the camera was easier to use on my old phone if I could I would get rid of it for a another phone I cant believe the salesperson recommended it after seeing what I had ad the transfer of data did not get completed  Place was short handed  etc Every since I got my phone Im getting dropped calls even in my own house and when my phones sitting on the table it will flash and say nopictures found it freezes up on me always when Im online I will just be reading something  Im not sure if theres a short  Or if the delivery driver dropped it  Other than that I love the looks of my phone  I feel like Im back in the 90s with dropped service and freezing up  Im very unhappy  For almost a week I was unable to text anyone who was not a Verizon carrier I am also still having issues of turning the volume up for notifications My volume is set to the highest volume but I still do not receive sound with notifications I am a Samsung fan I appreciate being able to expand the memory with the SD carda huge plus over the fruit products With this phone however I have had numerous times that the phone comes on unexpectedly or Ill pick it up  for example the camera is on or music plays I have also had issues with the phone getting hot while in my pocket I never had these issues with my Note 4 This review was collected as part of a promotion My wife absolutely loves her new phone and is very happy with itNo complaints at
all A great product Just getting to use some of the features only had less than a week Need to play with  and use more Love the galaxy s7 edge Great product hate the finger print security because its harder to read finger print than my old s5 Still always better than iphones Please dont upgrade the software so much that my galaxy become useless Love this phone Sharp HD videos from internet sites light weight Great camera good battery life Quick charge Beautiful videos I dont like that the screen curves off the edges it makes it hard to do anything on the phone with one hand My thumb pad will be clicking on something while my hand is trying to click something on the edge its pretty annoying Hopefully my case will fix this issue Also its very fragile Thank God I purchased the coverage for damage because I dropped it after 2 days of owning it I have a case ordered it just hasnt arrived yet and the screen broke in two different places from a 2 foot drop I had my last phone for 4 years and dropped it hundreds of times and it never broke  I miss my old phone but this one is way faster takes much better photos and the battery life is better I used to be iPhone user before I switched to android At first I started with LG G3 before it broke on it own Then I decided to try the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and I love it The phone is very fast and responsive It has a lot of unique features that help me a lot with schools and work It is very delicate for it feels like it can break easily Also the camera is not as good in low light setting But other than that I love It I definitely became a galaxy fan  definitely recommend this phone The transition from iPhone to the S7 took some work getting the voice mail to work when using the same numberThe phone is beautiful and easy to use The phone connected to wireless printer with no problems and transfer of contacts worked wellIm disappointed with the stated Battery times from Verizon and they are not accurate they fall short by halfif you use no data or apps the call time is good but apps run in the background and you cant stop themThe good thing is the phone charges quickly and I will keep it because it looks and works greatAlso the camera is awesome Love the phone but the continuous application notifications is driving me crazy 

Also I need to revisit the virus protection application that I downloaded for it The application seems to be taking over the experience of using the phone

Other than that great phone Better visibility and texting experience than my older iPhone that I transitioned from Really good battery life Improvements in all area over my previous S3 Only complaint sensitive screen Often goes where I dont intend This review was collected as part of a promotion I had my previous phone for 3 and a half years and I was hesitant to change it but I wanted to upgrade and and I am so glad I did The battery life is amazing and the overall ease of using this phone made the transition enjoyable Great phone clear screen takes amazing pictures worth the purchase Wish I bought it sooner I love that it water proof the touch screen is on point Like the phone however the battery life is very short it charges super fast but cant get more than a day on a battery and its only 2 months old For whatever reason this phone eats data like crazy Im not doing anything different than I did with my last phone Droid Maxx and I had to upgrade for double the data already the rep on the phone said all the newer smart phones eat data like that pretty lame cost me more money This phone loses battery even on safer mode  It drops calls  It freezes  The recent update has made it very difficult to navigate and print extremely small  It also left some apps not usable  Over all a very poor choice of phone Samsung does not provide an Android 7 update for this flagship phone Avoid it Really good phone Some minor issues as I was used to iphone 4 so needs some time The phone is easy to handle and it has great features  I talk and text  a lot so it serves my purpose I can not use my phone for much because it gets hot and shuts down  I also cannot put a protective case on it as it gets to hot and shuts down Cant watch videos or play games  Probably going to return To whom it may concern
        The Galaxy S7 is a great new phone with many features that I love 
                                                        Have a great day
                                                                                     Glassh3art I am so happy with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Verizon service The features are convenient and easy to use This phone is everything it was advertised and then some Great phone Have not had any issues But was sitting in a lawn chair and dropped it Broke the outside shell Phone works fine Not a very durable build Would not recommend going with out some sort of protective cover Ive always chosen Apple products for my smart phone before but I am currently using the Verizon Galaxy S7 It was really big decision for me You know why Reasonable price with great promotion now Fortunately Im satisfied with Galaxy S7 It has really fast speed quick respond nice compatibility and perfect quality of camera If you have a chance to get great promotion try to use it I will keep using this android phone until any mobile revolution is happened This phone is much lighter than my S6 Active The Samsung switch worked perfectly I didnt lose anything on the phone
Issues I have are a result of the latest OS upgrade to Android 7 Nougat It completed the upgrade but continues to try to upgrade over and over My text doesnt work right the battery life has dropped to 4 hours so I need to carry a quick charger with me everywhere Gmail takes 3 days now Awesome phone love the lighting fast speed and camera Makes the work i do much easier and faster Much love Have know video or pictures i want to share at this time A little more complexes to get use too But more features My last phone was a S4 this is a great phone easy to use and setup Only had it a month but great features and battery life I would highly recommend this this S7 Edge to anyone wanting to upgrade The limits on volume minimum prefer a lower level Also it doesnt ring as long as the S6 It was cut in half and before I need five minutes for my job needs Great phone no problems at the presentCheck back with me in a couple of months to see if there is any change I had had the S4 before getting a new phone to say I needed and update is an understatement One of my favorite features is definitely the wireless charging even through my Otterbox case Plus when I called to activate it customer service champ Eric reviewed my plan and updated me to the Verizon 5 gigs rollover data plan The phone calls are crystal clear and the video quality is incredible not a professional though cant speak to that expertise Loving it I bought 2 Galaxy S7s back in 2016 Black Friday spcls  it was a great deal  Fast forward to March 2017 my black Galaxy S7 gave me a half screen defect  nothing Verizon could do  Vzn ended up sending me a Cert Refurb S7 only time will tell with this one I had used an S4 from a friend and it was great  I bought a refurbished S5 back in October of 2016 and it only lasted six months  Even though I had insurance and it was still under warranty I didnt want yet another refurbished phone and possibly have the same problems again  I decided to start with a brand new phone and liking the Samsungs I purchased the S7 and so far its been a good phone Im still getting used to the features it took me awhile to find the text voicing since that was a little different than it was in the past  All in all Im pleased with the phone Was still using S3 was amazed at how many more features this has Great screen My S6 edge failed WiFi stopped functioning after a year
Wanted to upgrade to s8 but not available when I needed it
Chose s7 edge and the only issue I have is the limited memory
Would have rather got 64G and not bothered with sd card
Most apps wont work from sd memory properly Especially games This phone is awesome It does every task with ease It runs my games smoothly and the water cooling system does great The design is amazing and feels comfortable in my hand Though its a fingerprint magnet thats the least of my worries and its still beautiful I totally recommend this phone The battery life is great Its even better now that mine is running Android 70 Nougat The performance is great and the display is beautiful The camera is absolutely amazing The water resistance works perfectly Please buy this phone and you wont be disappointed I loved the way the phone looked and how it operated but I track a walk with my Fitbit and the GPS was HIGHLY inaccurate A 3 mile walk recorded as a 38 mile walk with me Zigging and Zagging all over the map I had an iPhone 6S where this feature worked perfectly but I HATED IOS I traded in this Galaxy for a Google Pixel and the GPS worked perfectly on this mornings walk The phone has a very fast CPU using kyro dualcores to power it with a decent battery to go with it I could get a good 10 hours on heavyduty apps and up to 2 days on a powersaving mode The screen is bright and responsive with the edge being a nice addition but I feel like it would have been better without it However it has some problems with heat but that could be a case problem Overall a very good phone Curved screen is a cool look however it is much to easy to crack the screen Best phone Ive had yet Love the edge features  Good phone Would recommend to anyome who wants a quality cellular device Im doing the same things on my phone and most of the time it gets hot for no reason Over heated 2x All the phones i had before this Is the one that i dont like The only thing i like is the camera This Galaxy 7 is by far and away this the easiest cell phone I have ever owned andor operated   The features are terrific the functionality is great and overall I am delighted with my experience so far I cant figure out the hidden setting the is not allowing get me to access mobile data while on a call The phone itself has a quick processor and is easy to manage The screen however is super delicate and even in a Speck phone case it cannot withstand even the smallest drop My screen shattered with a case on it from a 2 foot drop because it doesnt protect the actual edge of the phone ATT said they do not make cases that will protect the edge of the screen I would opt for the regular S7 if I had it to do over again I havent had this phone for 2 months and already regret it I have had a Samsung phone since before the Galaxy line existed I just switched from Sprint after having their service since 1988 A meteor hit me in the head which is why I finally switched to Verizon The clarity is night and day different and I had a Samsung S7 with Sprint Night and day Thats all I can say The phone interface is great I have serious issues with the battery life Ive had enough has the Samsung s3 s5 and now s7 and this battery has the shortest life Also Ive had it shut off twice while on speaker phone and using navigation  It just restarts itself after making a loud noise I would have expected returned it had itnot been for a restocking fee and being past the 3 day window Now Im stick for two years Great phone Does what I need so far much better than what I had before I like it a lot Glad I switched Best phone Ive had yet Purchased lots of phonesome over the yearsbut Samsung phones work best for me I really like the slim design Things are easy to access The battery changes faster than my S5 Staff at the local store are amazing Purchased a LG G4 18 mos ago and It died prematurely Opted for the S7 and very happy Unlike the G4 this phone runs all day on a charge and performs flawlessly Cant ask for much more The phone is small simple to use and great Speed of the phone is wonderful The lay out is the same as normal but very functional My galaxy s7 edge was the top phone to get when me and my family up graded It has advance features that get better with the system up grade I think the price is price but the phone is great I would be happier with phone if it wouldnt heat up all day long Phone is great fast with good battery life Camera is amazing and audio is clear Very happy with the S7 Love all Samsung products Especially the note 7 too bad it was recalled because I honestly didnt want to give it up The store I bought my phone plan did not have any Samsung Galaxy Edge I am in military training and can not get back to get a different kind
 I only had that one opportunity to get a phone Very happy so far The phone was not meant to be my PDA and I dont waste my life on it but it was easy to get use to it after turning in a S3

Peopleplease turn your used phones and request that they are recycled for victims of domestic violence This is simply an allaround awesome smart phone I was considering the S7 and the Google Pixel but ultimately decided to go with the S7 because of its resistance to water and Samsungs dependable reputation After having an iPhone the Samsung was difficult to learn to manuvre There are still things I dont understand I love my new phone I get service everywhere and its perfect for me  Picture quality is amazing  I highly recommend it I traded my Note 5 in for the S7 since they no longer make a note Im very disappointed in the Phone features expecially the camera which is the main reason I bought this over the modem To be totally honest it wasnt for the fact that I bought OtterBox cases Exedra I would have already went in and traded it however Im out several dollars on the accessories so I feel Im kind of stuck I love my new phone and the service that comes with Verizon  The transition to a new phone was for the most part seamless I had a Droid Maxx before and liked it It was my first smart phone Had it for two years Im 60 years old I like this new phone much more Better camera lots of storage more features Im not super techie But I do know my way around technology and I would recommend this phone I prefer my phones not too large and not too small and the Galaxy S7 is a happy medium when it comes to screen size The battery life and camera are both top notch Internal storage seems average given other options on the market but the memory is expandable via SD card

The shape and texture of the phone is glossy and slightly rounded which is nice in the hand but the design does lend to the phone slipping off furniture sometimes I dont normally put a case on my phone but in this case I found it necessary Everything seems pretty top notch Camera call quality app performance speed and battery life I have no complaints thus far and the refined Galaxy 7 design is aesthetically pleasing I am surprised how great my new S7 is I seriously thought about switching from my S5 to an iPhone 7 My son who is a diehard Samsung fan convinced me to stay with the S7 It is actually a little smaller than the S5 but seems to have more viewable screen It charges up fast and so far has been okay with the battery length 

My only knock and it is only a slight knock is that it gets kind of warm when it is charging up It is not I am going to catch on fire warm but enough to let you know it is warm That being said they hit out of the park with the new S7

The compatibility with other chargers being able to use a charging map and the USB connector adapter is awesome You can really turn your phone into a minicomputer now The phone itself is very good however the battery life just like any other smartphone as awful as long as you get an external battery case such as a power bear or something else that you can charge it while using it it worked wonderfully lots of nice features It does everything I expect It is easier to use than the mini droid I was using Now all I have to do is figure out what all it can do If I cant figure it out I will make contact or check on website the Best 
I cant wait for the Note 8
Samsung hasnt let me down from my first phone the S
excellent for work 
excellent for every day living 
over all the best cellphone mfg by far I needed a Phone with a speed capable ofgetting along with my new hearing aids  My Note 4 was having real problems  I am NOT a techy and dont need or want most of the grand new stuffI just have to relearn how to do what I want to do  One of those things is the weekly notification of my groups of the where and when of some of our activities  I cant do this if I cant send a group text  NO ONE ANYWHERE has been able to tell me how  My mail box is full of offers to explain to me how to manage my data  I seldom use more than 05 Gbthat would be a high use month I use this phone for my work  texting google maps internet etc  Work and I do alot of texting back and forth Loving my new phone the camera takes awesome pictures I also really like the finger print sign in Over all Im  enjoying my new phone Its fast and does everything I need it to and then some Great device 
Could be a better battery
And stereo speakers would be a plus It is not as good as the iPhone wish I had chose the I phone it offers so much more and easy to use not liking my android Wont let u change certain functions the way you want them like sounds notifications and internet access Had better options on the s4 I have had nothing but iPhones for many yeats so the transition over to an android was a huge step for me I was amazed at how easy to use this phone really is The apps are easy to locate and download The storage is huge and the camera is crystal clear I am still in awe and have shown all of my iPhone using friends how fast and easy this phone is Im hooked forever The phone is thin and an ideal size with a very good screen This phone is very slippery without a case but I found a great case for it and a good screen protectorI like the minimal buttons to accidentally push on the sides of the phone and the sound quality is very good The battery life was less than expected but the Samsung charger is very fast I am very careful with my phones and still have a very hard time getting one to last two years so I am hopeful that that this one will be as durable as it is beautiful My son loves his new phone Hes very glad to have a phone that works Thank you for great customer service Honestly I like that it is very similar in function to the Galaxy S5 that I had before Its user friendly and has a lot of the same features Thats important to me if you liked any galaxy phone you will love this one I like it It is smaller than my s5 and much faster Great phone Ive had the S7 edge as well this phone is better in every way Buying this phone unlocked eliminates the ability to receive all of your carriers features I like fact that you can chose to let members of group conversation see responses Like when I delete emails on phone it deletes from my computer  Old phone didnt do that Very easy to use Ive only had this phone a few weeks  but the ease of use after owning the S5 for years upgrading was definitely to my advantage I have never had a phone that was easier to adjust to and learn I love the bright display the edge is terrific so that I can pull up items with ease a big upgrade for me and im completely satisfied with phone is very fast plenty of awesome features with a good design waterproof The display functionality sound color camera video capabilities available apps and the gear 2 watch is mindblowing The watch even alerts me to get moving when my meeting last too long at work Love my Edge 7 Impressed with the camera features especially the low light and zoom features Good video also This review was collected as part of a promotion Like the phone Miss the infra red capability Storage slot for the micro card to upgade memory is awesome I just dont like the phone   Its not what they make it out to be  Little letters so hit the wrong one all the time  I just dont like it  I really love this phone its fast and the picture on it is so clear the processing on it is very fast Easy to use except that when I attempt to reply to an email the reply fails The store where I  purchased phone asked if I  needed help and I have  asked three times and not received response Very frustrating A first time owner a little learning curve but this old guy is learning new tricks  Like the fast charge on the battery  Good phone II prefer glass and the feel of it it is hard to find find pretty cases like what iphone offers The phone should of been made with shatter proof glass 64 gb should of been standard on this device for the price Easy light and just the right size to handle Apps are quick to load and easy to find on pages The color selection is also a positive for those who dont want just a black phone i got an upgrade from my old galaxy s5 and i am very happy with my new galaxy s7 edge looks good works better  very satisfied Great phone lightweight easy to use I keep it with me all day and my battery does well I love the range of cases available online for this phone as well I like the fact that I could transfer all my information from my old Samsung Galaxy phone to my new one I also like to speed up my new phone I love all the new features it has and so more up to date then my old one  I like the new style easy to hold in your hand and also takes beautiful pictures  Samsung has gone above and beyond other phones  They can not compete with Samsung Easy to understand and easily communicatesintegrates with other operating systems The only thing better than the s5 is the built in memory Much worse than the s6 except the extra memory Still no HDMI out so its a nobuy for me I cant find the things I want so many extra added not needed and did I as for this  You dont really want me to go on do you just to get to 100 characters Camera isnt as good as I wanted it to be but still better then my iPhone Over all I really love the phone  This phone has great features and is easy to operate once you get the hang of it
Great camera lots of storage especially with the SD card All it does is bombard me with advertisements  Its brand new so it cant have a virus unless it came with one  Ive never had a phone that does that before  None of the instructions Ive found online to get rid of these annoying ads work  Ive had several different smartphones and none of them have done this  If you want to swipe an ad every time you want to use your phone then this is the phone for you Samsung S7 EdgeI am not a fan of the edge at all It makes typing difficult as numerous characters are on the edge and hard to tap when typing
The phone is like most phonesif I am not wearing a headset of some sort when talking on the phone it hangs up an me I have Verizon service is ok better than ATT
Phone has too much bloatware and garbage like all phones 
I am tired of having to sign up to some site to do anything at all and then get 57000 emails or texts a day from some bozo ad firm trying to pass off some useless product or service 
All in all like all cell phones its average i didnt write home to the folks about it The Galaxy S7 was a perfect upgrade from my previous phone a Galaxy S4  The operating system is easy to navigate and similar enough to the previous versions that it was not hard to adjust to at all And the battery life is so much better Best performing phone I have ever had Highly recommend The phone and video is great The phone is fast The sound is clear It is a great phone I love it and how it works Using my fingerprint almost had me locked out of my phone forever It took many tries for the phone to accept my fingerprint and once it accepted it it never recognized it and kept locking me out of making another try Makes me envious of all my friends who effortlessly use their fingerprints on their iphones 

Plus its text messaging system leaves a lot to be desired 

Camera though is a huge improvement over my Samsung 4 Old phone died  Battery length a problem all along and still have to charge multiple times with new one Phone was easy to transfer information   Only issue has been allowing apps to share as sometimes it changes the settings itself and I must try to figure out why I cannot see contacts in certain apps particulary Whats App Exceeds all expectation Camera shortcuts Samsung apps display speed I had a Galaxy Note 4 before this phone and this S7 is simply just a simple upgrade from my old phone The pics are a bit nicer and there are a few more fun features but nothing that Im really incredibly impressed with  Its another good quality Samsung Android phone and has all the basics that I expected  Thanks I love everything about my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Its a good phone with great features I like the sleek design of the phone Sooooooooo much better than the Droid turbo 2 which was suggested for my last phone Disappointed by that suggestion from the Waterloo store assured me it was just like my Galaxy Camara the best and service  I am costumer since 2006 never I have problems I hope continue lake that  thank you It freezes I like the phone but dont feel like going through the hassle of sending it back It also stopped receivingemi email I love this phone Beautiful screen Still Learning I just downgraded from an S5 to an S7 Yes I said downgraded My S5 I could talk on the phone and conduct business on the internet at the same time With the new S7 you cannot do that So I have went backwards and Technology at least 5 years Apparently Samsung has decided to go backwards instead of forwards and Technology I am very displeased and upset with this change Key functions are not aligned properly   The use of the s5 are a lot easier to use  Thus making phone easier to operate than the 7 Sill getting to know the phone but I am very impressed thusfar  Just transitioned to Nougat no manual available yet so learning as I go My friends told me I would regret waiting so long to upgradenow I know they were right I love the phoneall aspects and features This phone does everything I need and more I couldnt be happier This Samsung is a great deal nicer than the Samsung s3 that I replaced I am still learning this phone I am not a teenager so it takes me loanger Ive had the phone about 2 weeks now and Im very happy that I went with this phone The colors are sharp The battery lasts all day even when traveling and using it  The Gold color is gorgeous It was VERY simple to transfer all of my old phone to this one even with switching carriers I was extremely impressed with that part I had considered the Edge but went with this one because I can be a tad clumsy and Im glad that I did because Ive already dropped this one and not caused any damage to it I have a simple case for it because it matches the phone and the InvisiGlass front screen cover but thats it Overall this is an awesome phone Best phone Ive ever owned Prior to purchasing the S7 I owned the S5 and I am equally satisfied with both products Overall great phone got everything that was expected plus more My old phone was a Galaxy S3still functional but not really keeping up with the times I like Samsung products in general so upgrading to the S7 was a no brainer for me Also I received a Samsung Gear S3 for my birthday and the two work together really well My only real complaint is its a lot heavier than my old phone but Im getting used to it I also had to do a full uploadtocloud and download for my old phone because the directconnection transfer didnt work  wouldnt connect Way better than the Galaxy S 5 just as easy to use My grandaughter talked me into getting this phone and I really glad she did Im still learning how to use it but I love it It works really well for me and I like the feel of it in your hands This review was collected as part of a promotion Foam forms well in all areas and is excellent and hes of you day and night the phone does have one slight drawback with almost all smartphones the battery life could be a little longer drain does seem to be a little fast but I havent checked the settings possibly theres a setting or two that needs to be changed As smartphones go this is another improvement in the already established galaxy line However 3 months into its life I began having ghost images on all screens leading to my having to acquire a replacement 8 months into the replacement and Im finding the battery life diminishing having to restart the device approximately once every 2 days as apps lock up and Im beginning to lose my enthusiasm for the device Hopefully other units dont have the problems I have had but these problems have led to my disenchantment with Samsung galaxy phones The face of phone very hot to the touch Green line has appeared at right side of the face When I took it to Samsung rep at Best Buy the phone came back after 24 hoursI still do not trust it I do not place the phone on flammable materials Contract was for 2 years only lasted 13 months The phone was not dropped or abused Will be speaking with apple in near future This phone is by far the worst phone i have ever owned It is poorly made It runs slow The apps run slow It cracks easy Definitely doesnt sustain a light drop like other durable phones doOpening up the camera takes forever The quality of the pics are terrible I had the Note 7 and loved it and was forced to downgrade and turn that phone in for the edge I have never been so unhappy with a phone like i am now I love this phone it has held up great i am a HEAVY Android user and it has handled it well BUT i had to use its warranty to send it in for repair because of super amoled burn were the screen has ghosts of images on it permanently i sent for repair OVERALL GREAT Very pleased to see no major changes yet nice enhancements  I would like to see the same tones notification moved to the new phone Not an issue really just get used to the tone being email etc and they change I like Samsung products much more than my previous product This phone is fast and doesnt lag in any way Perfect for what I use it for I havent even used all of the voice activated features yet I upgraded to the S7 from my S6 since my S6 mysteriously got slow once the S7 and S7 Edge came out Theven S7 is nice I mainly got it for the water resistance Its not much of an upgrade features wise The battery is terrible It drains a good 10 in 30 minutes or so just sitting With the S7 portable charger is a must have if youre out and about Phone is a lot smaller than expected Also the screen protector I bought with it dosent fit properly Its like it wasnt made for the phone I purchased love the phone works great looks terrific  Way better than the phone I had before and I liked it a lot This phone is terrible battery wont stay charged and is way slower than my old galaxy s5 wish I still had that phone Perfect size and weight The screen is big enough to enjoy games and movies As a hair stylist I take a lot of pictures of hair colors I do on clients Only phone I have had that picks up the dimension in my clients hair All around an awesome phone I like the S7 the power button is located in a better spot and has longer battery life I did like how the S5 displayed the apps in use at the top of info bar screen display but cant get the S7 to display the same wayI also miss the eye icon designating the unit in useother than that it functions fineso far I have been a Note fanatic from their beginning and i would have purchased another one My only disappointment with the S7 Edge is losing my stylus and handwriting abilities I used it often at work The Edge is very nice aside from that I hope to see some type of Note return soon though Samsung rocks I like the size and the ease of use I set up my device to meet my unique needs I dont like the hard installed apps that are difficult or impossible to remove I simply deactivate them as they are more of an annoyance that a benefit Great network coverage and reliability Easy to work with and transition to from my last Samsung Galaxy phone I dont care for this phone it is to small ant hard for me to see and type on I am going to trade it on for a phone with a bigger screen This is by leaps and bounds my favorite phone Ive ever owned It multitasks beautifully and the controls are intuitive A year later and I dont feel like I need an upgraded model even with OS upgrades it works just fine I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 Model SM930VL and its not supported by Samsung Switch on my PC with is a great inconvenience if you want to back your phone up on the computer or search for updates for your phone This has been the worst phone I have ever owned While I like the aesthetic of the phone the reliability of it has been subpar The first one I got overheated while charging and the screen cracked It constantly would overheat even with the fast charge turned off When I asked for a replacement since it had the issue after 2 weeks of ownership Samsung and my provider both said no It continued and got bad enough where finally the sent me another one but I had to pay a little extra The phone they sent me was broken The screen didnt work well and you could barely swipe to open an app let alone the phone They replaced that one and this one while better than the previous again is not quality made It cracked in the bottom right of my phone from falling 2 feet onto carpet Though it is obviously my fault this is supposed to be made of gorilla glass that is very tough to break yet it broke from a measly 2 foot fall While other people have been more fortunate with the phone I seem to be the outlier and have had the worst luck with it I will never buy a Samsung phone again I would have like a different color but its awsome besides that This is for my girlfriend Ima be waiting for the note8 Its Battery life is definitely improved and the metallic feel makes me think its much more than the price I paid for it too I have owned many Samsung Phones and this one is the best It is fast user friendly and I believe it also has the best camera Pictures are amazing and brilliant WONDERFULL PHONE Much brighter and clearer screen Camera is a big step up to my old S5 phone news Well worth price of the upgrade I wanted a darker color but was never avaiable so I settled for the gold Not happy but living with it I have only had the s7 edge for about a week and cant stay off it So many different features its amazing Looking like a good relationship with my new Galaxy S7 This review was collected as part of a promotion It has a bigger screen than the s6 edge The screen quality is much better more crisp Pictures are wonderful And I dont have to worry about accidentally spilling anything on it where its waterproof So far so good Love the features and plan with good battery life Although I have only had the phone for a few weeks I have had no problems Still learning how to use it not sure Ill ever use it to its full capacity It seems intuitive fairly easy to work through the process when using a new feature As time goes it should become a more comfortable tool Galaxy s7 has many good features Ease of use is good Photos are great Takes time to learn all the things it can do and to set every up the way you want it Worth the time Very disappointed that its so difficult to find features readily available on the S4 Bookmarks and downloads are 2 examples  The S4 was very user friendly  Miss that Overly sensitive it goes off opening things on its own  Very difficult to enter on the keyboard even after making it bigger  Response time is good and so far the battery seems to last longer and charge faster then the S4 My daughter and I are enjoying our new phones and features We are discovering new features each day I am not sure about the phone It seems to need to be charged alot and it gets hot when I charge it or use it I guess if I could I would rather try a different  phone Easy to use and set up Beautiful graphics Id have preferred a smaller size but this one fits in my pocket without much trouble I am never disappointed with any Samsung galaxy phone Every upgrade is always a great choice I will never use any other brand The battery dies fast when in use At idle it lasts a long time Got a free 256g SD card good selling point The phone is not bad a little fragile gets warm when charging battery life is not the best wish you carried the S7 active great phone no problems yet good features no compaints Its faster the camera is better and in general better it works similar to my 4 so i have some brand loyalty it is pretty darn expensive though I like that I no longer have to bring along my tablet My new phone phone has all the features I need and then some  Im sure I will be learning about all its features for quite some time This would have been a 5 start but store kept trying to put tempered glass on my screen but it would not seal When I got home with out a screen protector I noticed the edges of the S7 were not flat against the screenthe screen is raised and had to slope down to meet the edge of the phone  I still love the phone but would like a good screen protector Best choice for a phone for the money  Good screengreat sound the best phone I have ever had service is great This is a great phone intuitive and fast The only challenge is the battery life I ride this pretty hard and on tough days I am back on the charger by 200 in the afternoon BUT that being said I would still get this phone again i miss my Calendar options from the Galaxy S5  This Samsung S 7 does not have the Emoticons to mark my calendar I love the galaxy s7 Its really easy to use products line for it is good and there is alot of different things available to use Doesnt matter what quality of video you select whenever the video is sent to another phone via mms the quality of video is SEVERELY derated Its all blotchy and looks like a bad attempt at digitalizing some old atm machine video footage The Samsung Galaxy S7 has many great features to offer The processor is faster and the camera is awesome Galaxy S7 has the same cool features as the past Galaxy S phones but has many more features to offer The Galaxy S7 is also dust and water resistant This phone is amazing Great speed light weight and stylish No problems Works as expected Easy to use if youre used to the Samsung devices Comes in gold and white options Good memory space Hate the text messaging Miss my Droid it was so much better and easier to use Even this survey is too hard to send The phone is a improvement from 6s Sam Sung Battery life good Fun phone I like using camera for dj events I upgraded from a really old galaxy s2 and I knew anything I got would be better Im glad Verizon has a new plan so my bill ended up the same with the new phone payments and insurance  Only thing I dont like is the sim and SD card loading tray Has great camera like the split screen option The phone is very powerful with running multiprograms at once I havent had enough time yet to learn all the features  The features I have used were easy to transition from my old galazy 4 Really like the reliability and look of the s7 Its a very user friendly phone I love the wireless charging very handy I am impressed with the various facilities afforded by this phone That includes the battery life and camera So far I love this phone The battery life is so much better than the s5 which is what I had before Easy to use ease of transition from old phone since we were using a Samsung S4 and ungraded to a S7 The new software is extremely fast Slightly smaller which is actually a good thing than the GS5 I had before  Fits in the pocket more smoothly  Operationwise its fast to boot up battery lasts a good long while and its generally an improvement on the older Galaxy models  Very pleased This phone does a lot of things a bunch of things I probably dont even know about yet Go s7 Its got alot of fantastic features Love the quality Would love to learn more about what other features it offers This phone is a little smaller than the S5  I am not a fan of the slight curve to the phones edge but every other feature is excellent  I thought my old phone took good pictures but this one is outstanding  The battery life is much better This phone is easy to use and has some upgrades from my s6 like email functions which are important since I am a manager and use my phone a lot for my job I love it the phone gets extremely hot when I browse facebook for more then a few minutes or anytime I watch a video on you tube Its also very laggy even compaired to my note 3 that I was using the glass back is stupid I have had it less then 2 weeks and there is already a crack in the back The 360 gear camera that came with it is  complete junk anything more then a foot away is grainy I have my doubts about the advertised 30mp All and all it was a terrible move upgrading and I wish I would have just kept my old phone Phone is really nice Graphics are clean and clear Love the crisppictures from the phone I do miss some of the features my S5 could do that this one doesnt but Im learning to live without them I had a flip phone So to be honest anything was better I use to have an S5 and theres not much difference in my opinion I wish ot had 64GB instead of 32GB And it had way too many unnecessary predownloaded apps So 45 I needed to replace my Galaxy S4 due to lots of redundant issues I narrowed my choices to The S7 Googles Pixel and an I phone 7 I am so glad i made the choice i did Everything is really good on the S7 especially the camera I have problems holding my phone still due to shakiness Even when I zoom in to 8x the picture is very steady I cannot put enough words to describe my love for the phone To make it easier Ill list my only one complaint Battery lifebut beyond that the phone is amazing Good live my new phone  price was good fast on line pictures show well need to receive something free Samsung makes good phones I use lots of data take lots of pics always check FB and play my favorite game I would recommend Verizon Great customer care fair prices Easy to work with The two main things I look for as a customer are excellent customer care and affordable prices Those are the two main qualities I look for when choosing to do business with any company and Verizon has them in abundance Very proud to be a new Verizon customer I have finally got the galaxy s7 edge And its everything that I was expecting and more The ease of functions and the design of it I couldnt be any happier with it The 12 mp camera makes pictures look like its in HD I would highly recommend this phone to anyone To me this phone blows the others out of the water More bad than good to say so it wold take to much time to write it all My new S7 is faster and smoother than my beloved S5 I ride my mobile devices into the ground and traded in my S5 only when it started heating up at inconvenient times such as when my wife is trying to reach me Anyway I love the S7 so far Using it is effortless The only reason for the 4 star rating is that I havent had enough time to discover all its features Everything I hoped it would be The size of the phonethe weight and sound is great I feel this phone is a great value This is a easy phone to use for work and play like that is 32 g phone many features and great memory I needed improved internet access and better functionality than was available from the land line that Ive been using for the past 20 years  Friends and colleagues have had good experiences with the Samsung Galaxy phones plus I have used Samsung products in the past which is why I went with the Galaxy S7  I am very happy with it especially the Mobile Hot Spot feature  I will now be able to relocate my desktop system to another place without needing to move the telephone line Nice phone Can hear this phone much better than old flip phone Camera seems good Not happy that the battery doesnt last as long as the old phone Still learning how to use it but do like several features The phone is about the same as the galaxy 6 The camera is better The only problem I am having is the space bar while texting Not big difference from s6 battery life could be better too many Samsung app preinstalled My phone does much more than you last android as well as look better the screen itself was a hazard But overall I am enjoying  this product  and look forward to the great customer service that I have not been receiving  from my last service provider I love my phone  Way better service then other companies in my area  Friendly staff and fast service Absolutely terrible I am counting the days until my phone contract is up I own two phones one for work one for personal use Samsung phone never works in my neighborhood especially in my home The iPhone works pretty well Obviously the samsung phone is not compatible for my service area I have attempted to reach a solution via verizon customer service multiple times but no permanent resolve has been accomplished Still not able to use my phone for the simplest of needstalking So disappointing Sound quality is an improvement but so many apps are embedded and everything gulps down battery and data Constantly dropsswitches networks Every day I find a new use for my phone It was easy to transition to but it has so many added features It helps me at school as a timer I love the beautiful pictures that it takes I love that it is so thin and the screen is largerI Just Love It galaxy s7 edge love the 32GBs internal memory specially the option of the extendable memory up to 256 GBs with a Micro SD card love the screen resolution best camera on the market best of all water prof I definitely recommend this device So much easier to use than iPhone and cheaper The camera is great but still learning  Hoping to get it down soon Lol Screen in smaller than Im used to so harder to use Changes made to the software which are not better this is an Android issue I enjoy this product a lot wish it was a little bigger and had its own stylist I enjoy that the phone is so smart Nice Phonesleek and easy to use  Had no problem transferring data from old phone   I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family  It serves my needs 100 Recommended Love it I love all the Samsung Galaxys but this is the best In love with it Main feature I miss is the continuous scrolling  Charging port is a tad tight and scared going to damage phone 
Other than that seems to be a great phone The phone features a lot of awesome upgrades from my Droid Turbo It feels faster has a clearer display and bettwr audio output With the addition of the removable memory on the S7 it was very clear that I would like this phone so I could fit all of my music The only downside to this phone is its battery Sporting 3000 mHa conpared to the 3700 mHa from my Droid Turbo its taking a lot of getting used to My biggest gripe was having to read forums on how to save battery as the S7 has many features that use battery that you might bit be aware of and then having to hunt them down and shut them off Overall its a good phone though and the battery issue can be solved pretty well by carrying an external battery or just the charger on general I really like just about everything about my phoneexcept for the battery Im lucky to get through the day and I am not constantly using it Its a nice phone I have always loved Samsung and am extremely happy with the phone and the details of the phone This phone gets the job done and it is a great tool to have with so many apps from Google and Samsung The cameras are superb along with many options to edit photos Very powerful tool Great device for a great network very well built phone top of the line fast and snappy easy to navigate like apps and the health app is awesome I love my s7 phone Had everything I loved about the previous versions and then added new things I love I do not like the Nougat update I dont like how the gallery is set up now I really hate the fact that the quick contact bubbles at the top of the messages app are gone I also dont like that in order to send a group message I have to scroll down all my contacts It was so much simpler before Personally I think the new update makes some things more complicated and took away what I loved most about the Samsung phones The Samsung Galaxy 7 is my third Galaxy phone  I had the S3 and the S5  I was happy with all of them but they improve with with each upgrade  I am happy with the 32 MB memory as I had 16MB in the past  I do not like the nonremovable battery  I hope this battery lasts I like the time on the lock screen  And something as small as a small bump on the charging cord that lets me know which way is up when inserting it in the phone in the dark is a plus for me  The fast charging is also a plus  There were no decisions to be be made  A Samsung 7 was going to be my next phone I switched over from the Iphone to the Unlocked Galaxy s7 I was really wanting to love this phone but simple issues that shouldnt be there are preventing me from doing so 

Before purchasing this phone I inquired about the unlocked vs locked phone I was assured by the Samsung Sales staff that this phone would fully function with any carrier especially with Verizon 

I am finding out the hard way that the simplest of features such as Verizons Virtual Voicemail is not available for the unlocked Galaxy s7 I cannot tell if and when someone leaves me a voicemail because there is no notification on my phone I have tried Voicemail apps from the Play store but have been unable to find one to work so far 

Samsung says its a carrier issue Verizon says its a Samsung issue because the Galaxy s7 is unlocked 

I am also finding out that the signal strength is lacking as well Verizon attributes this to being a unlocked phone 

The battery life could also be better Its better than my older Iphone 5 but nothing compared to my wifes new Iphone It also doesnt charge as fast as they claim 

For the price that you pay and with the available technology these simple issues should not be there Very disappointed If it wasnt for those issues I would absolutely love this phone So far it has been easy to use A little getting used to coming from the Samsung Convoy flip phone But was fairly adept to is in just a couple of hours If it holds up as well as the Convoy then all should be good I love it Amazing camera Clear calls Really fast and smooth for gaming Mostly use it for Pokémon go and it works perfect Not bad really wasnt worth the upgrade though Pretty disappointed overall compared to my galaxy s5  I like the features of the new phone as well as the feel weight and screen  Im disappointed that it doesnt seem to have the same network strength in my home as my last phone Samsung S5 I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was setup This Samsung Galaxy 7 phone is by far the best phone Ive had I like it but Id love it if I had more storage space on phone itself I do like that I can have a SD card again Im happy with my new phone It wasnt hard to transition I did have galaxy s6 I love the camera Battery life not too good Great phone Great battery life and recharge Was able to learn the function of the phone without difficulty My new Samsung Galaxy S7 is a solid upgrade from my previous S5 phone  It has upgraded features faster operating speed all while keeping things similar to past versions for a smooth and easy upgrade  Would definitely recommend one Very good quality on the phone Works well at work and keeps a good charge Process speed is extremely well Great phone so far Great battery life too
Graphics are good speed is great on wifile slightly slower when using data network Must return via UPS Lose the use of a phone for a week This phone is all round a good choice for people of big business or farmers I was expecting more features longer battery life and a noticeable upgrade from my S6 It really isnt anything special Had I known I would have kept my S6 til next year Just had a little problem with my kids phone and its was very frustrating going back and forth with apple and verizon The phone allows me to add apps which improves communications with my wife when either of us are traveling Love the Samsung 7 Easy to use Of course Ive always had an android so it was easy to figure out  Phones operation is excellent   Love expanded memory and increased speed  Wish the screen was larger  Have a difficult time using smaller keyboard Great service speed is fast Easy navigation Like having dealer in town Camera takes awesome pictures My first smart phone Yes I am behind the times Super user friendly I am very happy I chose the S7 The Samsung S7 is what I was looking for and I new from friends how reliable the service was so it was just a good fit One of the greatest phones Absolutely love it and wouldnt trade for anything else Big Samsung fan This phone is great This phone is great This phone is great This phone is great I like the size of the phone its really fast and the customization is really cool The camera takes really good pictures Cant download photos to my computer Battery life is only marginal Security features are a pain finger print didnt always work Sound controls are hard to work through case Great phone  Many features that can be utilized for all tasks  I would definitely recommend this phone to others Was really nervous about upgrading from my s5 I didnt know if all my pictures would transfer over but the s7 has a special app that helped move all my pictures videos music and contacts from my old s5 Am familiar with features but love the size and compactness Offers all the same features plus many more from my latest Android love the phone but HATE the glass screen protector it does not go edge to edgewhat a pain Who designed it and WHY did they try to type on the screen with the protector that doesnt go the edge very poor design Also WHEN will they start putting the speaker on the front of the phone seem so simple yet Samsung has not done it I will always own a Samsung phone and tablet period Love this phone Got the gold love the wireless charging Gorgeous screen Make sure to get the tempered glass screen protector and a decent case like the Otterbox Commuter series cases Smooth operation fast speaker is awesome and loud camera takes awesome pics call quality is great For some reason my older note 5 was much faster This phone is slower I also notice that it is not as sensitive to the touch as my note I have to push keys a few times sometimes to get it to enter and pulling down the notification bar takes a few tries everything Not as happy Im still getting used to all the new features on my new phone but so far I just love it  Its easy to find everything I need and it was so simple to transfer all the info from my S5 to my new S7  Loving the added themes and new applications  The screen is so bright and clear and with the added storage I can easily add all the new apps I want to I really love this phone I went from a Galaxy S5 to this So if I were to compare the two devices its amazing how much faster the S7 is I like that it comes with 32gb min instead of having to pay extra for more memory The camera takes great photos Even the front camera is nice compared to other models I have used This is an all around great device I love the small size of the phone And especially love the amazing camera quality I only wish the holster clip was a bit smallerless bulky Been using this phone now for 3 weeks  Its ok and does what I need it to do but i find its slow and locks up   Battery use is not as good as the droid I had and the speaking is a little more of the poor side  Being able to add memory to the phone is great and the video and photo quality are above average  Overall the phones not bad i just seems a little slow and wish the battery was a little better i love the new sleek look of my Samsung 7 scrren is alittle bigger and easier to text on This review was collected as part of a promotion I have never had a phone go through battery life the way this one does  I make very few phone calls and do not play games on it  I do have a few apps that I use when I am out shopping  Other phones would last days on one charge  This one I am lucky to make it through one day  I also do not like the fact that I can not seem to set up the home screen with the apps I want  There were already apps there and they will not go away  Also  I keep getting Briefings alerts  I get enough email and texts that I do not want unsolicited junk  I wish I had never bought this phone  My HTC Max One was way better  Also the internet is so much smaller on this phone  Do not like this phone at all Non removable battery is probably the worst aspect  My s5 lasted at least 34 the day before hitting 40  S7 is at 30  at half the day Edges are unresponsive with or without screen protector No Glass protectors  fit the edges started gathering dirt and peeling off in the first week Removed the feature of tapping screen to take photo  Speaker although it has a better placement doesnt cut it  I just cant recommend this phone to anyone  The only thing I find decent about this phone is the amount of internal storage for those apps that keep transferring back when they update  Was a problem with the s5  I had the Note 5 and almost didnt get the S7 edge Im so glad now that I did Happy to have a micro sd card again The screen and graphics are so much more crisp and more defined Note over saturated like some other phones Ive seen The design is great overall Not too hard to hold one handed or get into and out of my pocket Doesnt slip all over the place I do use a case and applied a screen protector Ive never had a phone where the screen was the edge of the phone so I didnt want to take any chances Its a great phone overall and of you have a note 5 and not sure if you should get one I recommend buying it Great phone Works great Also use Samsung phone  Cant imagine using another phone  Love love love it If I had never had a Note I would be crazy about this phone The features are great its easy to set up and use It takes fantastic pictures No cons yet I just loved my Note and wanted another one of those I was going to wait for the 8 but bought a new S2 Gear classic that just would not work well with my old phone It works flawlessly with the 7 Thanks I love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 I have been hesitant to get a smartphone but I really love all this phone can do It really is like having a small personal computer at your fingertips Very convenient Sleek design Durable Great UI Great service The nonreplaceable battery bothers me just a little bit but overall its a really good phone I absolutely love this phone Blazing fast performance beautiful display decent stock features However its audio really kind of drops the ball My S7 has a relatively common issue being the audio often crackles both through the speaker and when plugged into an aux input on a home or auto stereo system There is a temporary fix made by tweaking the audio settings but it always comes back Also the speaker is fairly quiet compared to my old HTC One M9s stereo speakers and even the output to external audio devices is quiet in comparison Overall its still a great phone despite its shortcomings Im hoping a future software update will fix the crackling audio issue At this outrageous price cant believe they took away IR functionality should have read small print S7 is ultra slick and harder to hold on to as well Battery drains fast and charging via laptop usb takes forever Really miss my s5 that was stolen This is a great device that works quickly and is very reliable I have had very few issues and the ones I have are quickly resolved My biggest negative comment about this phone is the amount of bloatware added by samsung and google I have no photos or videos that I want to post at this time  I do not feel free to post photos of family and friends on this and I dont have any others at this time  I still have not made a video  That is on my to do list The S7 is easy to use fast and meets all my communicating and online needs So far the battery life has been excellent with less recharging required I really like my new phone but the battery life is not very good Ive turned off several features in hopes it gets better My phone is so easy to use I just love the Samsung Galaxy S S 5 was great but the S 7 is even better awesome Speed graphics navigation feels good easy to use awesome speakers Awesomespeedawesome awesome It was an easy transition from my Galaxy S6 Too bad that it is slightly different in size and required a new cover I still had about 7 months to go on my S6 but suddenly the screen blacked out This phone is amazing  It Is packed with all the new Technology great phone design The best Screen on a smart phone to date I cant find anything wrong with this phone Would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a fast state of the art phone with all the bells and whistlesand the best camera on a smart phone liked Samsung phone including features and ease of use  everything easy to access so wwhen the camera stopped working I had no problem going back for a new Samsung  Was told features were same only better so purchased the newest model Going from a 7 year old S4 to the S7 has been outstanding  Easily switched  more advanced apps nice size screen fast and sleek I went from the Galaxy 4 to the 7 and I love it Easy transition Loving the extra storage space Pictures look amazing as well A great device Software wise I wish the mail program made it as easy to erase junk files as it was on the S5 Phone easy to use no problem transitioning from Galaxy S4  However battery life is disappointing  Several days with only modest usage battery ran out in early evening Ive always had galaxies and after having multiple hardware issues with the 6 I had to get the 7 but so far Im very happy with it   Love Samsung products love the personalization and the gold color option for the 7 is fantastic Excelent productshight expectativs
Good Speakers
Good design With great help from the Costco salesman we had no trouble learning to use our first smart phone  Everything this phone does is so fast The phone is great much better than the S5 I previously had It runs quicker and some of the settings are easier to find and set Bought it with a contract from Verizon Offer from Best Buy which included a significant gift card
The phone itself simply does what a phone should do Amazing snapshots with the camera  even in low light Party pictures are almost never blurry
Battery life is more than enough to last for one day basically its 15 days with medium to high usage but what are you gonna do the next day at noon or afternoon
The EDGE feature is more optical than actually functional because only few apps can be used for it I bought the edge because of the bigger battery size than the normal one
Samsung Pay works flawlessly on every chip card readerthis is where Samsung has one thing ahead of Apple You get points for every purchase which you can redeem in real money after some time
Summary It has everything you need and more Nothing to complain about I have been with Samsung since the S3 and they have never disappointed I have high hoped for the S8 when it is released I will for sure be preordering it once its available Its a great phone  better than my previous Samsung s4 love the features better camera and easy to use Good phone Easy to use I recommend this phone to anyone who want to change from a iPhone to Samsung galaxy 7 This is a great phone though Im on a massive learning curve coming from being an iPhone user the functions of the phone are much better High point Camera and resolution SO much better Battery life also If you play Pokemon Go this is your phone   Down side is that the audio isnt as good as my iPhone and its not as simple to use Grateful I have a techie person to teach me Thoroughly enjoyable with great features including a phenomenal camera and great battery times Really have no complaints with an excellent phone I wont be switching from it for some time This review was collected as part of a promotion I always expect new phones to be better but often missing some feature I liked in my old phone  Have not found this to be the case  I like the fingerprint security Works flawlessly   I use my right thumb so just pick up the phone with the right hand and I am in I love my phone and service is great And the people are awesome Im really happy Im with Verzion This is a wonderful cell phone I am still learning about all the new and different features I have found that all cell phones have a pretty big learning curve but once you have made it past a certain point it is just plain old fun looking at all the new and useful features
This galaxy has a wonderful camera I have really enjoyed taking my phone with me and taking pictures during school events 
The mic and speakers on the phone are really functional 
As far as ease of use it was pretty easy to figure out how to change settings and learn about issues with the phone that are easily remedied 
I would highly recommend this phone the screen protecter needs to fit the screen  When you use the keyboard the letters on the side doesnt always register when touched because of the way the screen protector sits This phone is in standby mode 99 of the day no activity and the battery drains constantly a 5 minute phone calls drains 2025 of battery I am stuck in a 2 year contract and hate this phone I have been a Samsung Galaxy phone owner since they came out Just got the S7 and disappointed in the life of the battery Not as good as my 5 I dont do anything different so either there is a lot more running in the background that I dont know or its just the way the battery is Otherwise I have no complaints with my new upgrade to the S7 I will continue to stick with Samsung its been a great phone Overall design and features are good Great camera slim design easy to use if unsure how to use or correct can go online to find instructions Added Folio case to ensure the protection of phone So far great phone I previously had a Droid Turbo 2 So my review is mostly in comparison to that phone The battery life on the S7 is only ok when in power saving mode But I had to play around with settings to find out it was limiting background data This was causing problems listening to Pandora and Spotify I had to keep opening the app in order for the music to keep playing I feel like the phone is also slow It sometimes gets really slow when I would be typing a message Or just slow in response to whatever I touched It does have an amazing camera And I do like the motion features it has Had an S5 prior to this The S7 is head over heels better Faster performance and great camera  The calling performance is much better as well Over a great phone I upgraded from an Samsung  S4 to the S7 The S7 is very similar to my old phone with a lot up upgrades I feel like I know the phone but there is still a learning cure on some features It took me about 10 minutes to figure out the camera when texting but it seems the upgrades are fabulous so far The pictures are very clear compared to my old phone It seems like the phone is more intuitive so learning is easy I have only had it about a week but I am loving it As much as I like the phone I did have to exchange for another one  The phone locked up twice within two days of starting with the new service  I got another new phone and had it lock up three times within the first week  I need to exchange it for another phone Its fast sleek and so much easier to sue over my older S3 Love that I do not have to turn it on to see what time it is The phone is very easy to use   Easy to navigate thru  Easy set and takes great pictures Love it a lot I love Galaxy S7 The features Galaxy S7 and Verizon Wireless work together on unlimited data make the best Basically the same as the galaxy s5 Ive had for almost three years  So far the integrated flashlight is the biggest ready usable upgrade a opposed to downloading a flashlight app  Audio via an aux cord still plays entirely too lowstereo must be turned almost to max which leads to buzzing sound most of the time The split screen apps could prove to be useful after further use everything but my business email moved over to the new phone easily the salesman at Costco was generally knowledgeable only negative I had a question the next day and called his number on his card but he never returned my call I eventually figured out how to install the email in question and my other problem was resolved by a Verizon rep one thing not explained was the one time upgrade fee My favorite phone my second Samsung and has improved features since the last version  Particularly the microphone and plug in  I love the charging station and the long charge life I love the size of it and that it is similar to my Samsung S6it was real nice to just switch to a new phone and it was easy to use like my other phone Didnt loose anything I needed Plus extrate features it gave The ease of the Samsung S7 is amazing Traded in my Samsung Galaxy 5 so the transition was easy  I did find newer features on the phone helpful  I disliked the extra software on the 5 and glad to see not much on the new 7 The only thing better than the s5 is the built in memory Samsung really dropped the ball on the design of the s7 nothing has impressed me about it Very User friendly  Faster  Just a real good phone
Battery seems stronger than the old phone  New
features are great I absolutelly love this phone Ill recommend it to anyone who asks me about it I previously had the GS6 so this phone is almost exactly the same which I love The only downside and I had this same problem with the S6 is that although I have 32 gb I always seem to run out of memory and I have to download all my pictures And I dont have thousands of pictures on my phone Im just at 1000 pictures and Im out of room on my device I dont have lots of apps either so if you want to keep all your pictures on your phone or have lots of apps you use get the 64 gb or expandable memory This phone is amazing and really easy to use Display is nice and big Battery runs down way too fast Just as bad or worse than my S3 which stunk They need to do something about the batteries They are horrible faster than my old phone pictures and all are clearer faster battery seems like it last longer than old phone Love the new clear gel case over all very satisfied Took longer than it should have to get old S5 data moved to the new S7

Was caught a bit off guard that S7 does not have removable battery  hoping the battery life is better than was the S5 or Ill be hurting in 12 months

While my S5 plastic back to the phone had cracked the S7s all metal case is much slicker and I felt compelled to buy a case for it as I am afraid I might drop it because it is so slippery

In all other respects the phone is thus far meeting my expectations  Some of the Samsung UI has been changed a bit but that happened with Samsung  Android updates too so no major pain there Simply put this phone has everything Its easy to understand and begin learning its new features I took one star because I live in an area where the service stinks Its not Samsung but I recently had an Asus Zenfone 2 and it worked great so Id like to challenge Samsung to increase its reception hardware and they will have a perfect phone for everyone Overall I like the phone but I find it  a little small for me I do prefer the edge plus it is wider Samsung S7 is great solid performance and familiar function to our Tab S2 Good screen great interface and good battery life Love the apps options and seamless updates I love this phone It has been the best phone I have ever owned Best phone I have owned hands down The speed and fluidity of all my games and apps is   exceptional 32 gigs on board storage with expandable SD slot allows for multiple large apps with no problems I really like the phone but the screen protector that was sold to me is complete garbage It doesnt work with the slight curve of the screen so I have major touch response issues with anything that falls into the foggy areas Love samsung products wouldnt want any other brand Great screen and awesome camera Waiting for the 8 I love the device  Im very familiar with the galaxy line  However I do wish there was a button while on a call to put someone on hold being on the Verizon  network TMobile  offers that feature It lets you know when someone puts you on hold Besides that everything else is great Battery could last a little longer that hough The pictures are smaller dont like that Having trouble transferring my old ringtones and music to new phone Very sleek design Fingerprint secure feature is awesome  Like that I can change the fonts and sizes The screen is crisp and clear Do not like the lack of a menu button in the bottom right of the screen like the S4 has Also there is way to much bloat ware on this phone I cannot r Ive had it for one week tomorrow  Thus far it is working just like my tablet does but with phone capabilities  I do not like the stock Verizon apps that came with it though hard to review a device that took over a week to figure out how to answer a call  Two weeks to set up voice mail  Not happy that you can not delete Apps that you have no use for This  phone is similar to my old phone The camera and photos are much clearer and sharper The color is also more accurate Havent had much of a problem getting used to the differences no  the screen protector cuts off the edges of the screen  REDUCING THE SCREEN TO SMALLER  SO THAT THE EDGES OF YOUR PAGE CANNOTBESEEN I like the size of the phone not too large or too small to handle I have been along time customer of another phone carrier and decided to try unlimited talk and text and data but it is still costly because I am charged to additional per line per phone to make calls This phone was an upgrade from an old iPhone Boy is it a huge upgrade I thought it would take some time to get used to an android again but that is not the case I love it Good phone Feels like a downgrade from my note 5 Smaller screen Battery life seems smaller to me No stylus Hasnt given me problems other than that Had Samsung S6 and loved it The S7 is just as good if not better Samsung makes great products Love the features easy to use  I have always trusted Samsung products  Great quality in style functionality and sound Great working phone Camera is great Switched from an s5 to s7sleeker style great screen still missing some features from the s5 Good phone Different from iphone products but does not freeze as the iphone Camera is not great unless subject is still No more Samsung link which was huge reason I went with Samsung to begin with Its just a basic camera phone I will be switching back to other brands of phones and TV and appliances of good quality and durability Glad I learned of Samsung poor quality now so I wont have to throw away my hard earned money away on Samsung products again in my lifetime and thankful I can let others know Love the fast processor in the phone My second Samsung phone Really nice I LOVE Samsung products I own a 7 tablet and the Galaxy S7 phone My previous phone was also a Samsung Samsung products are very well made very user friendly and provide fantastic graphic This phone is head and shoulders above any iPhones I have had I HIGHLY recommend it Im an old guy with a new phone this S7 will take me a while to get used to  If you want honesty in your reviews dont make some blocks only 15 character long and other mandatory at more than 100   I might recommend the product wouldnt recommend the review process This phone was top of the line and it still is Its affordable easy to use and understand and has been key in my my social and work life since I bought it last October Ive used it to make money entertain me keep up on trends set appointments text stream talk surf it fit all my virtual needs Ive just begin to realize what this smartphone is capable of and im discovering how to do all new tasks everyday  I highly recommend to anyone who needs the world at thier fingertips Had to make a quick replacement I broke my S5 Even though I was planning on waiting until the S8 came out so I could get a lower price I had to bite the bullet and get it early I absolutely love Samsung products and I hate to say that this s7 is a lemon always freezes and locks up I do YouTube part time and this phone hates it But I will keep it until the s8 arrives and lose money to upgrade to that I have had this phone for only 6 days but I came from att and had the same phone with no problems at all so I know its just this phone This is the first smart phone I have owned and so far I love it Hi res screen and a fine camera front an back viewing with great resolution and all the apps anyone could possibly use are available I think I should have stayed with the Samsung Galaxy Note  But now Im stuck with this Great phone I love it Everyone should have one the price is great Fun phone to use and play with Still learning how to use it as its still new to melove Samsung I wish I liked this phone more Touch screen is balky GPS goes haywire while I am trying to go somewhere Sometimes voice commands work sometimes they dont Really disappointing product The Samsung phone is easy to use and Im familiar with android operating systems The accessories are easily available and there are many to choose from Its fantastic Battery charge stay longer The speakers sounds is very loud and clear It is very light and it doesnt bother in my pocket Icons set up are easy to manage I guess there is no competitions for this kind of phone This review was collected as part of a promotion Awesome Possum sauce everything what its supposed to be and more still figuring out options and more Great device I love samsung products and the s7 is awesome it does heat up when Im charging which could be fixed and when I connect to WiFi it lags a bit but all around great choice Theres so much to explore I enjoy the similar layouts to the other Samsung phones There are more options to your basic device commands Verizon service is good and I do like the Galaxy but the S7  seems to be all over the place I had a S5 and liked it much better  I have only been using it for a short time so my hopes will be it will get better with time  Average use seems to be a bother more monotonous then it needs to be Email seem to be more or a chore then they had been  Not sure of the photos yet The only thing Im hesitant about now is the curved edges I thought I would like it but not completely sold on it I switched from a Note 4 and was ready for a slightly smaller form and this one fits well in my hand I was long overdue to purchase a new phone This model is a major improvement on my previous model S3 which by the way is working still fineI just wanted a better camera and a few other bells and whistles Happy with my purchase So far so great Love this phone I upgraded from an S5 and really didnt think there would be much of a difference Boy was I wrong The camera is fantastic the size is easier to hold with one hand and navigate itseems SUPER FAST battery life is outstanding and its so pretty Worst Samsung product I have ever purchased In 60 days of ownership it has been with Samsung for over 20 dayss for Warranty repairs External speaker stopped working and WiFi works slow when it works I like the phone the phone it is similar to my old phone not sure what else to put here  Hopefully I continue to like it I like that it is not much bigger than  my old phone  I am still having trouble finding all my old information or where it is now located Unfortunately phones have become way too involved in our lives so they may as well be easy to navigate like a Samsung After reading reviews I decided to get the S7 rather than the HTC 10  I had an HTC M19 and the screen was not very bright outside and the S7 with all the fancy colors was supposed ot be better  NOT  Still very hard to read the screen in sunlight
Also although this may be a user error I cannot get one notification tone for text messages and a separate one for emails
On the plus side I bought a Qi charger and that works really well Its a good phone with great features all that you could want in a phone The phone it self is fine my disappointment stems from the fact that I had purchased a Note4 because I wanted the stylus feature and removable battery This phone lacks both I am an insert name here customer and this was sent as a replacement which I am being charged for when I dont even have the Note4 paid off Thought the phone I had shouldve lasted at least the 30 months I was paying for it or be replaced with a phone having equal or better features I know you had problems with your most recent Note phone just disappointed as I said Im only typing here because it made me Now I need 60 more characters  Almost there  14 more to go The screen is a bit narrower and text too close to left border Space bar frequently does not work when writing text so have to go back and it  Annoying  But everything else is great  Also I like the weight and camera is excellent My S7 replaced an S5 The S7 is equal to or better than the S5 in all ways except for the nonreplaceable battery b Upgraded to Galaxy S7 and really like the phone just the right size and features are great Not much for change but glad I did I really like my phone just wish it came in Windows Just bought tonight Taking a little more time to set up than my previous Galaxy phone but the other features Ive used so far are good Not much different from my last phone similar icons 
Easier to see the brighter screen Like the EASY access visual features Great sharpness for photos  Key pad seems smaller  Hard to use accurately Need to improve for slight vision impaired people Love the wireless charging long battery life and metal body  The only thing that troubles me is the micro SD card never seems to work from the S4 forward  this one is no different The battery life is awful Within a few hours you are down to 70 without doing anything Expect more for the cost Not happy with the specs and performace of device cant say enough about this product other than connects to all samsung products like a champ Would like to see how it pairs up with new Gear s3 Frontier So far so good I hope that it will turn out to be much better than my S6 that I had I definitely love the battery life It is much better than the S6 Very easy transition to S7 from the S5  All my information was transferred with no problem Love the extra storage Uses far too much power even in Power Saving mode Speed and screen is fine but when pulling down screen menu it often locks up for ten or more seconds before retracting Extended battery makes phone thicker which I like but runs out of power far sooner than the Zero Lemon or Antec extended batteries on my older Galaxy phones Maybe a future Android software upgrade will fix these problems Maybe not Starting to wish Id gone with the Moto Force The key pad is to hard to type The prediction text i dislike  


 Yes great phone camera still needs a better clarity but its great for everyday Had S5 before and like Samsung phones the best This phone completely shattered when it fell about 2 feet to the ground  Not only the front but the back too  Its impossible to remove the back and there is jagged sharp glass sticking out Got this one as an upgrade for my s5 I really dont see any dig improvements over the s5 It is smaller and slimmer but the battery life is about the same I like the camera on the phone and the flashlight is easy to get to and use I dont like that I cant replace the battery myself I would have to take it in or send it in if I ever have a problem with it  I have only had my phone for a couple weeks and so far it works fine the battery will hold a charge for about 40 hours with my usage A lot of personalization available to those who need it This phone has a lot of meaningless but cool features I dont know why I would want my phones edge to blink and pulsate but it does and its kinda cool It has a dope camera and cool features to that as well Great phone all in all I had the Samsung Galaxy 4 before so I expected the same kind of features but I was blown away how different it was I was so used to the simple features of the 4 than I almost couldnt understand this one But honestly way better just plan out better The screen is better the camera is amazing the software itself I have forgotten how hard it is to change phones Battery life no better than my s5 They did not transfer all my info from old to new Lost all passwords and settings Phone has key board lag and to many apps I do not want but cant remove I would have liked a larger screen having previously owned the Galaxy S5 however what the S7 lacks in size it makes up for in picture speed and functionality unhappy the battery dies so quickly  I use it the same way I did my driod and it frustrating that by 3 pm the battery has 12 I have always leaned towards Samsung Products I wish Samsung would have left the IR blaster for TV remote in place This was a great feature that I used often in previous Samsung phones Removable SD card would have been nice too Great phone none the less Great design and features Worth every penny but the initial setup is anything but intuitive I had to dig deep into the Android forums to figure out why it wouldnt save text message photos to the gallery some arcane app permissions I still cant figure out why this phone wont display all my Gmail categories My old Galaxy did but even when I add my important catagory to the list with add folders it is gone again when I reopen my email app Same with custom text message alerts for my contact list I have them set in contacts but when I receive a text all I hear is the default tone Frustrating Missing some of the features that my other phone had in play store
No free music in this phone like the other one None that I like anyway
Some of the stuff is cool but I rather have another phone like the one I just had
Disappointed in features but I do like Samsung products This product is way beyond my expectations I highly recommend it for its ease and convenience I absolutely love this phone Personally this is the best phone I have ever owned This is a fantastic smart phone with loads of features and useful abilities I give this product 5 stars I love it I highly recommend it The Galaxy S7 is one of the easiest phones to use Everybody keeps talking about iPhones Why pay all that extra money for Less Edge 7 is nice only issue is the 64 GB version was not available when I had to turn in my Note 7 With the 32 GB version I have to manage my on device storage since it is running at near capacity The screen is nice and vivid and overall I love the phone other than only being able to get the 32GB version I have no complaints Really love this phone Have had another Galaxy for the past few years couldnt wait to get the S7 Does amazing things This is my husbands phone and he loves it he had the 5 before this one and he was so happy to get the s7 easy to use easy transition from the Note 5  Features are easy to use Easy to get around all the phone apps and settings it offers Had nothing but trouble with my first phone Got a replacement factory reconditioned even though Im still making payments on a NEW PHONE Already having problems with the secondreplacement phone Unbelievable I love my new phone excellent for talking on the phone because the sound is so good that it sounds like you are talking to someone in the next room Camera is excellent too This phone is absolute junk  Im assuming and hoping that previous generations were better phones  I purchases this one with an upgrade in November and just like the 1st Samsung phone I had it was good for about a month  After that it has been nothing but problems  Ive already had to hard reset it twice and claim warranty

It overheats and drains the battery at an alarming rate  It overheats enough that I can feel it heat up in my uniform pocket  And the wifi and bluetooth signal are constantly dropping or changing settings  I have it connected via bluetooth to my watch and sometimes I get the notifications sometimes I dont  Sometimes it syncs sometimes it doesnt  All depends on how the phone is operating that day  And while my computer and tablet can manage with the wifi connection this phone is hit or miss  And thats upsetting because then it either wont work or use the data connection

Then there are the apps  Im constantly having issues with the phone running or loading the apps And its frustrating because I use the basics  I dont play games all day on my phone  I dont use my phone all that much all day for that matter  Yet it is nothing but problems and constantly having issues as described above I am very disappointed with the video sharpness My videos are fuzzy Some features are more difficult than my s4 Hopefully I will be able to master some of these features And my videos will get better because the camera is one of my most used features Also wish that the screen was bigger I like the tech coach programhave spoken to them twice so far about my phonemy phone needs to be restarted in order to make a phone callthey fix it its fine for a few weeks than it acts up againin fact I need to call again as we speak This is the 3rd galaxy I have had this product has great features its simple to use its just a great product overall I came from an iPhone 6 so a first time Android user here The NOTE7 fiasco left me no choice but to go with the S7EDGE Got my Black Onyx S7EDGE on 20  Jan  17 as an early birthday gift Honestly I could not put this phone down it was just too stunning The display the features the battery the everything This phone is durable and lightweight The only thing that bugs me is carrier bloatware Other than that its an awesome phone looks I wont be going back to using iPhones Yet me Going back to using iPhones Over my dead body Only had phone for 2 weeks but Ive been thoroughly impressed with features durability and user friendly apps and options Went from flip phone to S7 Fairly easy to transition although still getting used to touch screen Love the ability to have better calendar and camera is much better Dont love the feeling that Im constantly being spied on I am enjoying my S7 I upgraded from a S4 The layout is a bit different but still quite functional and easy to use It has more capacity and storage space which is always a plus Always buy Samsung products They are the best Great Nice looking phone Has the galaxy 5 before this Better features but phone calls echo in ear Im not as impressed as I thought My phone doesnt work with talking to people so I took it in to get checked and thought it was fixed  Went back home and there are times callers say I am fading out while talking to me and its still going on  Thought it was fixed  Need to take back and get another phone but too expensive as will be charged for restocking fee Just got my phone havent had it for a month but it is not too much different from the Galaxy 6 so lets see how it goes The Galaxy S7 comes with too many preinstalled apps Phone functions seem to be up to expectations I was worried initially about changing to a smaller phone This has turned out to be only a slight problem to my old eyes lol
The camera exceeded my expectations and Ive only just begun to explore what it can do
The speed of this phone is also a bonus May be that my older galaxy was so slow but Im amazed at how quickly I can accomplish a task Still trying to adapt and get used to something new but can say Im pleased overall Enjoying the Samsung s7 Especially the 256 gb card that came free I dont have to worry about storage anymore So far I like everything about it The camera the storage the design  Just everything about it so far The price and size of the phone is what drew me to purchase the S7 However I disliked the set up of the phone the inability to changeadd apps to folders phone wouldnt connect to the bluetooth in my vehicle speaker phone did not work Ended up hating it and exchanged it for the LG G5 The issue is when tapping out a message or any type of typing on the phone when you get over to the right edge the touch screen stops working  The reason I am told is because there is a slight curve to the screen along the edges and so when you try to tap the letters or numbers along the edge of the screen your finger does not touch the screen completely  Frustrating  If it wasnt for that I would give this phone a 5 star i love this phone i would def tell other people to purchase With the S7 I dont worry about dirt rain and it has even taken some very hard drops Great phone Wont buy another brand name ever again Samsung for life pretty design decent weight and size yay fingerprint scanner good sound and better speakerspeakerphone placement fantastic improvement on the camera fast charging is great i still think theres room to improve with speakerspeakerphone placement and maybe placement of earbud jack maybe miniusbpower too really good stuff overall though This phone is great I couldnt wait for it and wasnt disappointed in the slightest The design and easy functions makes my experience with this product very satisfying I love the design It has great battery life The best phone Ive ever had This review was collected as part of a promotion Great improvement from prior form once gotten used to  Have yet to use camera but find all other features very satisfactory I am disappointed that I have to go to another screen to type in the numbers and most of my passwords include numbers Great Phone no problems so far well worth getting and a great improvement over my galaxy s4 which I had for years Charges faster and has a great screen My advertised memory card has not shown up Within the first week I had an alarm that would not go off even after I restarted my phone Used the same application on Galaxy S5 for years without an issue But so far that is the only issue I had an iPhone 5c and the difference is like night and day compared to my new galaxy S7 This review was collected as part of a promotion Love this phone It is the best samsung ever Team samsung for life Always love that I can do multiple things at once with ease and doesnt crash on me I really like Samsung products for the most part the S7 Galaxy being no exception I was however very disappointed when I upgraded to the S7 From the time I first took it out of the box to charge it the phone would get so hot you couldnt even hold it If I played a video after maybe 30 seconds into it the phone would start getting extremely hot It would do the same thing if I tried to play any games too Within a matter of a few minutes of playing the phone was extremely hot Once it would charge sometimes it would hold a charge all day other times it would drain extremely fast One day I had it at 100 put it in my purse  3 hrs later after not having been used during that time I pulled my phone out only to find it hot as can be  the battery was down to 25 Luckily the phone was still under warranty  I was able to exchange it but I cant honestly say the replacement phone is any better It doesnt seem to get so hot quite as often but it does still happen There are also times where it seems like its not holding the charge as long Not to happy with the way the phone is how slow it is and how it is hard to type on really nothing different than a basic Samsung phone Not satisfied but stuck with it It makes texting very easy as it learns commonly used words including my dialect So far is a fast running reliable phone  Also has a great camera with lots of memory  Also has a removable SD card to upgrade if you need more memory I had a note before this phone  It doesnt have the features that the note had  It is also a pain to use  Dont like it at all  Wish I could switch to another phone  locked for 2 years  ugh Upgraded from the S5 and can really tell a difference It runs smoother and speedier The battery does not run down near as fast and applications look and run well The back is a little smoother than I would like but that was fixed with a slim cover to give more traction when holding or pulling out of my pocjet Overall really enjoying this phone It seems fine except I keep getting the notification sound for a text and there is NO text Its very annoying So I turned all notification Tions off except Calendar And it is now making that sound for emails though I turned off nofifications Transitioning from the Samsung S6 was super easy with the Samsung Smart Switch Very cool of Samsung to include an adapter in the box to connect phones via hardline MicroUSB to MicroUSB  The phone is fast and responsive and the camera is excellent  I bought the phone during the Samsung promo that gifted you a totally free 256Gb SD card  I have and will continue to recommended this phone to everyone Upgraded from a Note 5 to the Galaxy S7 Edge Absolutely love the phone The extra features took this phone over the top in comparing it to other phones Looking forward to my future experiences with the phone Good phone but bad speakerphone  glass breaks easily Great for the shower and everything else except the speakerphone Conversations on speaker tend to cut in and out 

Dont ever drop this phone without protection it will crack It cant be covered enough

OTHERWISE AMAZING phone My Galaxy S6 had some issues with the charging port so ATTAsurion upgraded my phone to Galaxy S7 I have to get use to the Gold color but the phone does look nice with my black Otterbein case The S7 has some nice new features I have had my new phone for about a week so I can not say much I am still learning my phone The phone is amazing Its very very nice It does get hot though GREAT PHONE AND GREAT PRODUCTS IVE HAD ONE OF THERE Tvs and phones for years Now  thanks I struggle with learning how to use the programs after updates are installed  Things change but they dont tell you how to use the I get frustrated I am 88 years old could you make a phone for an old person  My wife and I each got a new Galaxy S7 a month ago and have been extremely happy with every aspect of the phone The camera functions are amazingIve never looked better in my life We highly recommend this product I have had Samsung phones I like that it talks to my other Samsung devices its just as easy to use as my last phones I went from an Octane phone to the S7 It is a little overwhelming at the moment I am sure that once I master it I will love it It is just very confusing at the moment One thing is that I have to charge it everyday I only charged the Octane once or twice a week I am not even using the internet on the phone yet since I am sitting next to my computer I have my emails turned off to save on the battery and still it is draining I like the phone it definitely works well The low light camera feature is sweet I do have to say that it really doesnt feel much different than my S5 however I still seem to use all the same features I do like having the wireless charging dock which is something my S5 did not have All in all Im happy with my phone I would recommend it if yourecord in the market for a new phone It does everything I need to do for my job I am a small business and it loads and works all the apps I need on the road I dont use it to its full potential so for me its about the same I like the improved pull down menu for the added apps much handier Like the phoneupgraded from galaxy 4s mini  tho prefer the smaller size of the mini Having problems with speed of accessing sitesseems to be delays more times than notneed to call about this problem  Design is good features good I like the cost and quality of coverage I like the representative that helped me with my purchase would recommend to a friend The Galaxy S7 Edge is Glorious Its the phone you dream about when you dream about dream phones I just have a few things that sort of tug at me 1 Carrier bloatware should be completely uninstallable as a matter of fact just dont put it there let me decide how to use the storage on my device I am buying it after all 2 Performance at these specs should be better system lacks optimization other than those two issues my S7 is a Dream Former iPhone Disciple This phone has yet to let me down I look forward to my next Samsung after Ive abused this one too much Got this as an upgrade from my note 4 this phone has a good camera for a phone the internal speaker is weak but I rarely use it for music so thats not a problem This phone runs smooth no stalling  if you know how to manage apps and large files on an android device I have thousands of songs and pictures and hundreds of large pdf files that I use for work on this phone and sd card No problems yet seems to be a good phone Phone performance seems a little sluggish Battery dies extremely quick compared to my S7active I had with ATT Excellent mobile phone with awesome features Also Verizon provides a good coverage for the New England area I purchased my phone online this time and feel I got a better deal than talking to a representative when we ordered my husbands phone  We paid off his phone because he lost it and paid upfront for his new phone with a 2 year contract and ended up paying as much per month as we did while we were making payments on his old phone  This seems very strange to me and no one could offer a resolution that satisfied me I really like the Galaxy S7 Its fast with great features superb display really nice camera expandable storage and an excellent battery Also the wireless charging is nice and the speaker is ample I have only had it a little over a week but love it so far I really dont have anything bad to say about it at all I had a note 5 prior and this fits my hand much better I plan on keeping this phone a while I love my s7 edge I was a note user but I switched to the s7 edgegreat phone It is very easy to use  Better features than the S5 had  Glad the charging adapter was made smaller I would rate this item higher and probably have in the past but realized this weekend that this phone has no ability to connect to a television unless it is Smart My note4 needed a dongle but that was fine chinzy of Samsung but fine This phone doesnt even give you the option 

I had put together a slide show to honor a friends father which would have been nice to play for friends and family on the very LARGE screen at the facility Wasted effort since it was not smart 

Considering the cost of this piece of equipment you would think that Samsung would be able to offer the same options as prior versions I said something to other S7 users and they were also disappointed in the lack of feature I went from the s4 to the s7 and was immediately happier Every complaint I had about the s4 was resolved with the s7 Im especially excited about the dustproofing The options menus are more sleek lots of customization available and fingerprint unlock to name just a few of my favorite things Im also glad I can access the SD and SIM card without having to take the back off I havent found anything I wanted to do but couldnt If I had to complain about anything it would be the learning curve as the functionality of the physical buttons changed between versions Overall good uparade I wrote a nice review but it wouldnt allow it because it somehow violated one of the three very vague rules about leaving a review so whatever Nice camera The product is very good easy to use It is very nice looking and light to hold The brightness and sound are very good for even people with difficulty seeing and hearing I like the overall quality and features of the phone The only thing I dont like is where the power button is in relationship to the volume buttons  When I go to turn up the volume I hit the power button  It has happened several times I wish the power button was on top or on the same side as the volume buttons Great phonefast and easy to use
Bright colorgood quality camera
Nice design 
Have been using this phone for less then a monthand all I can say so far it is great Cant adjust screen sensitivity so now texting and generally using the phone is VERY frustrating because its not sensitive enough Ive heard others complain it is too sensitive
I use my phone to record video at work they made some weird framing changes that cause the phone to zoom in after you press record SO That means I have to frame the shot while already pressing record UNLESS I change to VGA which sacrafices resolution VERY irritating

And yes I did research online to see if I could fix these issues Ill come back and update on other things that upset me later if I dont give up and return the phone today I like that you can expand the memory and was looking forward to using that feature too bad I wont get to I am trying to learn all the features Right now their is a hickup with texting to my husbands phone only his Strange Going to stop by Verizon and see what may be the problem Wish me luck Ive had a few questions about some minor things and the people at the Verizon were very patient with me Everything you need in a phone Takes great pictures and video Easy to navigate between screens Nice size for display This particular S7 I was sold is nothing but junk Owned it for 11 days and nothing but troubles with it  I will be taking it back to the store for a replacement Love my new Samsung S7 I had the S5 and the battery would get really hot No problems with this one so far Wanted a better camera and this one seams to be awesome so far Nothing special about this phone and it gets extremely hot to the point where my hands are burning I need to know how to check my voicemail I havent figured that out yet But I like how Verizon is interested in what I think I replaced a Note 4 with this phone because basically I didnt want to wait for the next Note  Anyway so far this phone has been great  I had some issues with setting it up to run with all my old apps but I think Ive got it close enough  Still some alerts and whatnot that arent working but overall a very good phone Hi 

I have been through the S S3  S4

This S7 Edge is the most user friendly unclunky phone yet 

Honestly the others took a little time to get used to

But the human interface improvements in this phone made me forget that it was new

its was so easy to acclimate

Thanks Great features easy to use love the gear accessories and wireless charger Cant wait to purchase the virtual reality headset pretty nice device and transition from S4 fairly straightforward but cannot figure out even with help of verizon drive and online forums to activateuse some files that were transferred via smartswitch theyre there on the S7 but i cannot put them where i want them The phone freezes all the time the battery dosent last long at alldosent even compare to the note 5 I had before This is only my second smart phone My first was the Galaxy Note II This is a much faster phone I did have a problem with the mobile data turning itself off on its own I turned on developer options and set mobile data to stay on all the time and that fixed it My only other issue is that I have apps set to update on wifi only and I have to manually update them They do not update automatically like on my Note II This might be a Google Play issue though and not a phone issue Yeah It fell in the sink while washing dishes Still works like a charm Just dried it off with a towel This phone is flat out the best phone I have ever had or had the pleasure in testing It does everything and has everything The camera is spectacular The camera might not seem like much being a 12mp camera but duel lense and low light focus is out of this world Easily the best camera on a phone to date The features and tech specs of this phone is amazing The big battery lasts for hours on in and Im just really blown away by this phone to say the least I would definitely recommend this phone to family and friends I had the note 2 before this phone so you could say I was living in the stone age so you would see my amazement with this phone lol I actually have tested other phones like the iPhone 6 and 7 also the note 5 and the new moto and lg g5 along with the LG v20 Aldo just recently tried out the new Google pixel XL and I still have to say that the s7 is superior in every way The only phone that comes close is the Google Pixels and thats only because of the unlimited storage capacity which is just flat out ridiculously amazing lol GET THE GALAXY S7 You will not regret it The Galaxy S7 Gold is pretty awesome not sure what else I can say  Ive had many types of phones in my time and this is by far the most intriguing fun and responsive I had to finally get a new phone and looked at the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge  Chose S7 and am so glad   Great screen resolution  and so easy to learn new navigation  Highly  recommended This is the best of all the Samsung phones I have had Lightweight and very reliable So many buttons to push Much too complicated user interface Samsung in my opinion has long led the race with phones Ive been with Samsung since the S2 And I will keep with them They make the best phones best features and can process anything you will ever need great phone nice upgrade from my s4
just wish I knew that Samsung was coming out with s8 next month I would have waited now Im stuck with this s7 for 2 years  
I The S7 is Samsungs best phone yet It has more features than I will ever know how to use I have been a long time Samsung fan and will continue to be with this phone and the two smart TVs that we own Samsung has the best quality everything I will only ever buy samsung productsThey last for a really long time and is something I will continue to invest in everythings good  just the screen breaks to easy  Slim and lightweight battery talk time not long enough complicated to use battery fast to charge small texting lettering This phone is much faster and works better also on low signal than my last phone
This phone is also easier to use The phone is a good improvement compared to the S5 model  It also helps that the operating system is more recent  The sound is much better compared to the S5  The screen has a finer resolution which is great  The home button takes some getting used but overall I like it Love my S7 Edge Wish the battery lasted longer but accept that since the rest of the device is awesome Cant see myself going back to Moto Best phone Ive ever owned and havent had any problems yet Vary easy to operate and is vary similar to the Motorola Droid razor max that I owned 6 years ago Great display light weight great battery and its perfect size when other phones are getting to big The phone is very easy to use The features make sense and are simple to access I would highly recommend this phone Im happy with my switch from motorola droid turbo to the galaxy s7 Love the android phones and wont switch to another operating system This is by far the best smartphone I have had so far The features and functionality of the edge makes my calling and texting much easier and quick access along with the other apps Ive positioned on the edge The quality sound coming from the speakers are awesome and not tinny as in other manufacturers and the camera quality is hard to beat Overall a great smartphone which is the envy of other manufacturers who are so in awe that they are copying some of the designs and features to stay relevant This review was collected as part of a promotion Screen keeps blacking out and exiting apps etc

Also phone case did not protect screen and now my brand new phone is shattered This is a great device I use it constantly and Im also a cluts In saying that the water repelling is fantastic because I have a habit of dropping my phone I just got this phone but so far so good Its a lot faster than the previous model and I love it My only struggle with this phone is swiping for the drop down menu  It doesnt always work  It also takes extra effort when pushing on an app  It has been easy to learn to use and I camera takes great photos The phone is very nice however I dont like the loss of privacy related to having to use a Google Account or Cloud to store and transfer data although this is a convenient feature on the go I purchased a 32 gig card for added storage this saves my picture and video content only not contacts Net Apps are nice and good camera  Read the Users Manuel to learn new features Battery drains in roughly 15 hours  Turned off applications scanning for wireless etc  camera quit working Have always loved my Samsung products but this is the worst phone Ive owned The S7 is a major upgrade from the S6 Faster and longer battery life The expandable storage is a huge plus Ive my new phone for only one week So far so good Im still in the process of learning its features and how to navigate through the applications There are a couple of questions that I have about things however I feel that I can consult the tech coach or work through the things that I want to know I give the phone a 4 star right now because its still too new to fairly rate it a 5 I have had numerous phones over the years but this is by far the best one Easy to use great size and has all the features you could ask for I like the features of this phone I would recommend this to others it is easy to navigate through After using the S4 for years I reluctantly bought new S7 when my internal memory filled I knew I would have difficulty learning my way around any new device and I was correct but thats on me Im not at all tech oriented and after 2 wks still can barely navigate myself through what should be easy functions However the ones that I can use are amazing The camera takes photos that look professional My S7 did also but I was never able to capture the moon in any picture I took This one is filled with new full moon shots from last night The overall colors are bright and very appealing I miss a couple things like extra volume battery replacement option and the fact I just cant seem to find how to do things If I could and again this is me not the phone Im sure this would be a 5 star review I highly recommend this phone Better than my old S4 in every way especially battery life and UI responsiveness except one  no MHL support which it doesnt work with the S3S4 multimedia docks for analog audio output or for charging either Shoulda done my homework better so Id have known this before buying though I probably still would have anyway but now I have to get new chargers and BT adapters  Sigh Phone is nice works fine Problem is I rechives a bunch of Emails stating I had 50data then received another stating I had 25 Data then next day I received another stating I was out of data and charged overage Not happy Its so  much info to work with I came from Samsung Galaxy 3  The button on the lower left of the screen used to be a menu for options settings delete  others Now it just takes you to recently opened programs I miss the menu the widgit for running programs the ability to view recent calls such as missed placed received rejected individualy I believe it is way over priced To many steps to accomplished even the most minor of operations
Onoff buttons on outside of phone are not correctly positioned Constantly lowering the volume when holding or turning onoff The Samsung s7 Edge is quite different its got the rounded corners its got most used icons on the edge of the phone so just swipe and its right there easy to use sharp bright responsive screen good size great camera and we love the Gear VR that we go with it I like the looks size convenience and functions  A good solution for some one that has one phone and likes photos and internet search I have memory loss and information is quickly accessible to bring the memory back Im  interested in learning and the internet search is helpful I tried to find shutter speed options in the camera but was not able to This phone is too complicated and facile Its already cracked I had my s5 for 2 years and never any problems our damage Three days and my new phone was cracked Transferring all data and apps was so simple With the new transfer block it only took minutes and even eryrhing from my old phone was on my new one The functionality and UX is worse than the five year old phone Im replacing I will never get another Samsung Ive never had this level of buyers remorse before Everything from weird automatic emoji insertion to obfuscated GPS toggles to the limiting Samsung UI overlay to poor sound quality when talking I hate this phone and often want to just use my old one which works better I HATE THIS PHONE I keep as many APPS turned off as possible I dont stream video I make very few phone calls or texts and rarely check email from this device
It is also very cumbersome to carry I have tried various ways including belt clips which get tangled in the seat belt of my truck I am very active on and off of machines in and out of my vehicle Unless you have a sedate office job access to electricity and a large pack to carry this device Buy something else Six months in and no flaws design issues or problems The phone is great  Easy to navigate through and fits well in my hand  New battery lasts pretty good and protective cases are easy to find  Thanks for the phone Samsung and Verizon This phone is great Crystal clear screen The pictures are great It has tons of memory space so you can have lots more stuff on it Not to mention that it looks slick as all get out Prior to this phone I had a LG flip phone for the past 4 years  I am learning the phone and it fantastic After buying the phone on a Monday new and installing only a few apps the video doesnt work sometimes until I restart the phone  While this is usually not a big deal I missed recording the birth of my niece due to this less than 5 days after purchase  The phone was nearly tossed into the parking lot of the hospital

I use the phone to watch videos at night in bed and the buttons at the bottom for back and apps are so bright they are blinding  Dimming the screen has no effect on their brightness  On my previous Droid if I dimmed the screen those buttons dimmed as well

The camera takes nice pics but is slow to respond which makes catching candid shots tricky

Battery life seems good and the SD slot is wonderful Had a Galaxy S4 and was dreading switching to a new phone but when the battery would not hold a charge for more than 12 hours I made the switch to the S7 Surprised how seamless the transition was and now the battery lasts 2 days This phone doesnt function as well as my previous phone and I would not ever purchase another G7 I prefer my old LG The S7 is similar enough to my previous S4 that any operational changes were intuitve The screen resolution is amazing making video and pictures much more vibrant The interface with email and apps were quick to switchover so I was able to leave the store fully funtional I have recently switched to the GS7 from my trusty Capn Kirk communicatorflip fone  I was forced to do so as my cell provider is dumping the cell business  I have spent about 30 minutes with the phone since I received it  By the end of 2017 I expect I will have used it for at least ten hours total and will have a better idea of what it does  I have little use for the fancy smart features of the product  It is a phone and it is seldom turned on  This may change over time but right now I miss my flip  which fit in my pocket better I love the way Samsung has designed this phone
Its lightweight easy to use and no issues using the phone at all I like the design and functionality of the product compared to past phones  the camera and video are good quality Still getting used to it  Trying to figure out features  Message app not as intuitive as previous  Having issues figuring out google maps and connectivity  Doesnt seem to connect as well as previous  S4 The Galaxy S7 has met all my expectations I really like the calendar features and the speed and reception It is easy to use and the right size to carry in my pocket love Samsung I used an iPhone a few years ago and wont go back have now been using Samsung phones for the last 3 12 years This review was collected as part of a promotion The Samsung S7 has been an awesome phone so far Ive had it less than a week I love the app SmartSwitch it worked seamlessly through my old LG G4  the new Samsung Galaxy S7 
Lovin the battery life too  camera takes incredible pics  video There was not a great deal of difference between the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S7 however the small changes were improvements I havent explored the camera upgrades yet so cant comment on that but overall the difference appears to be  from a very good phone to a better one Im having issues with my text messaging It seems that if I need to send or receive images it creates a separate text strand with this particular friend One for texting and one for pics It seems that the pics go to my gmail and the texts go to another messaging app on the phone Quite annoying After I bought a Vizio eseries tv I decided to upgrade my phone as the Vizio uses apps on the cellphone to control streaming online content Not only do the two devices function seamlessly together but compared to my old Samsung Galaxy s3 the s7 is beautiful the goldonplatinum finish is so striking I bought a transparent phone case for it light fast incredibly userfriendly charges rapidly less than an hour and holds a charge throughout a long busy day The screen is big without being too big and for an added bonus the earbuds included with the phone sound much better than youd expect particularly when paired with the Poweramp music player app available on the Google Play Store I love this phone I am still getting used to it but overall it is great  It is way better then old one Galaxy s7 is not to much different from the s6 but it was all I could afford Pluse the phone I really want was sold out I love my new phone and would not ever trade it for another divice samsung is an amazing company that knows that people want I am very spoiled when it comes to Samsung they have really good phones and features Their apps are easy accessible I love the water resistance feature Pretty much the same as my S5 a few items are a bit of an upgrade like how easy it is to uninstall an app and viewing text messages when in other apps I like the phone just wish it came in white The black seems to masculine and gold isnt an ideal color either I am very upset with my new phone The battery is terrible  Anyone that speaks to me on the phone says they cant hear me I hear static Soooo disappointed   I feel like I threw my money away Apple is better by far Overall I like this phone for its ease of use  It is easy to get set up the way I like it and even easy enough my 3 year old grandson can get to his games This phone is very durable and useful I love that I can use multiple apps at a time and it runs flawlessly Its fast and is easy to use
Ive dropped it a hundred times and it doesnt even have one crack
I would recommend this to anyone Love it Ive only had this phone for about two weekseparate now and Im already regretting it The signal on my galaxy s7 is the worse Ivery ever experienced I usually only get one bar inside and only two outside For the price Im paying I shouldnt need to go outside everything I want to surf the Internet or send messages And to add to this the keyboard is way too sensitive it keeps closing out while Im typing I thought it would improve once I got a case and protective screen but it still has the issue and just did it at least five times as Im typing this reviewvery frustating I would love to return this phone but Ive already  invested too much time into it The transition to the S7 was relatively easy A few glitches where I hit a key and something different Muscle  memory is slow to transfer I would have liked the off button at the top of the phone I often touch it by mistake Still wish I could delete apps I never use My phone use is fairly simple Email text facetimeSkype Web search I could use less phone but nothing out there  Nice size Nice heft Nice screen I like the control buttons at the bottom of the screen I dont like the control buttons on the side of the phone as theyre too difficult to press I like the app notifications and how theyre visible without unlocking the app It took me a while to find the phones settings They should be more visible I couldnt find any documentation for the native apps  even when I googled them online  it makes it difficult to use their features I love how the screen shows the datetimebatteryetc when the phone is locked Love the features on this phone Always a plus with Samsung Camera is good storage is good holds a lot there could be a lot more features and battery power for the cost but its ok Great camera  Could use more available ring tones on the phone  Very clear sound and ease of adjusting features Samsung Galaxy s7 is the best Couldnt ask for better The touchscreen is not nearly as sensitive as the S6 but I feel like the rest of the device  features is exactly the same I dont understand the point of the upgrade  after the fact that I have to practically jam the keys on the screen Im perturbed that I even bothered to switch Really good product by Samsung The camera to earphones everything is just perfect It is a little touchy when I try to answer a call but otherwise I really like it The speed and picture quality are excellent Like the longer battery life and speed of system Like the 32 GB internal storage  Dislike the Verizon messenger app and prefer the Samsung message app The S7 has new features that make it more convenient and a pleasure to use  Great job Samsung keep making those quality products I used to have a prepaid phone because i didnt want to get locked into a contract However the amount i paid for the prepaid phone was almost as much as my new phone and it didnt have any of the incredible features this phone has From the very beginning when i was trying to decide between the Galaxy S7 and the Iphone7 which i rather disliked because Im not a fan of Apple products it was about which phone was more durable because i work a lot but I also wanted a phone that felt awesome to own From the moment they opened up the box to show me the model this phone just felt SPECIAL It was different and it was me all the way First impression It came in a smooth hardcover box that said 32GB right on it so you know its got lots of room for apps and it came with a pair of call receiving enabled headphones so you can already listen to music and take calls The phone can take and send video in 4K definition The phone is compatible with VR technology This phone is absolutely as smart as they can be and its also almost completely waterproof and its all on the most reliable network i can get service when i go hunting and fishing in the middle of the woods What more could you possible needwant Nice little phone I had a note II and I loved it I was looking forward to getting the note 7 but it got recalled My old phone was starting to act up so I couldnt wait for the note 8 release so I settled for the s7 This phone is not any faster than my S5 it has less features and I cannot send a MMS while on wifi I am very disappointed that the IR blaster was removed and not impressed at all with the speed My S5 seems as fast if not faster than this phone The battery life seems to be the same or less than my 2 year old original battery in my S5 Easy to use since its just a newer version of my old phone Some of my apps wont transfer over like they are supposed to But I guess its ok Everything else works fine on the phone I will never use another brand of phone again Samsung galaxy has been my go to products for many years Easy to use I have a Samsung tablet so icons on this phone were familiar Love the camera  just in time to take pictures of new grandbaby I miss my Otterbox New case gives no protection of ports very restrictive audio port My audio plugs wont fit the case narrow opening Bad design Inferior to the Otterbox I am better able to keep better informed of events that effect my daily life from the weather to current events and news updates Nice phone and service  This was a nice upgrade from the Galaxy S6 I got this one for my boyfriend the next one will be for me I love everything about this phone It has a great looking screen that is easy to see and very clear Great Touch recognition and accuracy The best thing is that the battery lasts a very long time So far I havent got under 24 hours out of it on one charge Love this phone and all Samsung products Always on top of technological developments and desing Couldnt be happier than today with the acquisition of my S7 I do not like the company or the business practices that the company uses 
I will terminate my services in the near future It has a wide range of coverage among the wireless I ever have been used The battery charges much faster than my previous samsung and also lasts longer It does have more storage capacity than my old phoneIt takes less time to install the applications Best Samsung phone I have had yet Will definitely be keeping with the same line I love my 7 edge it is my lifelineI use it for work and personal I sometimes struggle with the edge feature it is really touchy and pops up when you dont want it to but I can always get out of it and I am right where i was I have always had a note and  to not have the choice as a customer of many years to not keep my note 7 I was highly disappointed As a consumer of a product you have or should have the option to keep the phone of your choice or keep the product that you are paying for as your choice There should be no type of mandatory recall it should be an option of recall and the consumer let them decide if they want to sign a waiver or not but to take away a consumers choice is taken away a consumers freedom Its small and had way less features than my note 7 which I was FORCED to give up and I in general hate this phone Not much different than my old S6 Active but the WiFi connection isnt the greatest  Had the same issues on the Active Not sold the upgrade was worth it yet Ok its an alright device
Yall asking for too much 
I have other stuff to do 
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii quit Im frustrated by the shape of the screen the beveled edges make finding a good screen protector very difficult and finding a screen protector that fully covers the screen impossible I love my new phone and would recommend the Galaxy S7 to people  The design and functions are easy for consumer As I have talked to people keeps dropping calls and battery life is awful should have kept old phone but mic was going Other places came back less hidden costs Nice layout Black screen with time when not in use is a big improvement I really dislike the fit of the screen protectorits not wide enough though its supposedly made for this phone I didnt have too much to figure out that was different from the S5  It just took me a few hours to get everything the way I had it on the old phone  Im still tweaking it  I wish the battery charge lasted longer Improved QWERTY added numbers so that you know longer need to switch between alpha and numeric  Easy to use The Note was a more comfortable phoneI like the larger screen on the note I Had the note a duplicate to the note would have been my choice the rep Nathan showed me the option and my bad I didnt pick the right phone Ill live I really like this phone The battery life is perfect for me and I can execute the apps that are important to me Ive had this phone for about a month now and am loving it Ive owned Samsung phones before but this one is by far the best Screen resolution is top notch No lag and the video is unbelievable
Edge screen is nice feature The rest of my family have iPhone 7 The features on this Samsung blow the iPhone away If you want a bland phone then the iPhone is for you Also the ability to expand memory is a big plus I dont like being limited by iPhone They want you to pay higher premium for phone just to expand memory If you want phone that will pretty much do it all the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge is top notch Best phone available in my opinion I thought I would be more of a fan of the curved screen About a year into ownership I dont enjoy it so much Very vulnerable to cracks with the curved screen Dont dare do put the phone in your back pocket and sit down And Im a slim 120lbs This is my first smartphone and I am still exploring all of its functions  So far I am very happy with the design and performance of the phone Love this phone So glad to finally be back to a  Samsung device Such a great phone to have with good quality This phone is amazing Easy to navigate Lita of storage and the personalization  options are almost end less And it takes pretty good pictures too I would for sure recommend  this to all of my friends I love it so far Very excited about the new color Have been wanting this for some time now very hard to get Love the camera on it as I am a photographer and tired of the junk ones on my previous cell phones 5 star cell phone  Not all of my photos were transferred initially   lengthy process Had a few crashes already  locked up screens Hoping it gets better Already had shortage of storage message  it shouldnt be I previously had a S6 phone and liked it very much so it was easy to upgrade to a S7 It has an excellent camera which I was very interested in I like very much Samsung phone but the Galaxy S7 should come with larger internal memory With the protruding glass screen a case is required making it a tight fit in a shirt pocket Using it with my Motorola roadster is rough It is faster and the display is clearer Sound is muffled probably because the speakers point down Creates problem with speakerphone Im still getting use to the phone  Im in my 50s and a novice with the ever changing technology  I like the basic functionality I had to trade in my other phone because of a recall and was hesitant about replacing it at first but it was a good choice for me I love the features of the phone like having different apps at my fingertips on the edge of the screen so I dont have to scroll through the apps tab to find my favorites I also have a picture of my granddaughter there so I have a bit of sunshine every time I access the edge I got a new Galaxy 7 in November The problem started right away I would try caling and it would sign off If someone called me it would kick over to voice mail After 3 months of resetting the phone they gave me a new phone this Monday well this morning I tried to make a call and the phone would Not work again On my way to Verizon again I love love loved my S5 Active Sadly it got wet with a loose cover and samsung stopped making the batteries This model although not as rugged as the S5 active isnt bulky and childlike as the S7 Active is and is claimed to have the same water and dust resistance The only other drawback is that you cant replace the battery without special tools Im buying extra batteries but when they need to be replaced Ill have a pro do it But the S7 is definitely more rugged than the S4 I had before the S5 Yes for me the practicality is more important than the tech stuff Donto really have that many problems except the alarm clock will show on the phone when its not being used The phone was easy to transition to from my 5s I dislike the power button being so low Also dislike the clock screen staying on I have been a galaxy fan for years Had my s4 since that first came out and I was hesitant  to upgrade since I liked that one so much This s7 is way better and faster than the s4 and it was exactly what I was hoping for The ease of moving pictures and numbers over was much easier than anticipated Personally I think for the price of the phone it should have included the wireless charger This phone was more than my rent which is probably  another reason I was hesitant  to switch but I needed a new phone and I am glad it was worth the switch I would have preferred a bigger phone screen but it seems like they are always out of what you want Love it Is a great upgrade from my previous note 4 Switched from a note 4 edge and it is much better could have a better camera Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love my new phone I ditched my iPhone for my gold platinum galaxy s7 edge and i absolutely love it It is beautiful fast and responsive Mostly everything about it is great except for 2 things The lack of software updates and the design I havent gotten a software update since November 18  2016 that was a year ago Also the design It is pretty in almost every way except for the way it scratches It cracked when i put it down on a table it cracked 2 times and scratches like crazy Also the speaker is really tinny and easy to muffle But overall It is still one of my favorite phones Difficult to get started some basic instructions would be nice like how to find out where the apps are I had to go to YouTube to find out hoe to use Google Play this should be one of the first and basic instructions I think I am just more of an iPhone person I will be going this weekend to change phones The Galaxy is slow and their finger print technology doesnt work as well Battery life is very good   Screen is easier to read Easy to access multiple  email accounts  Fits in my purse I got this phone for my wife due to us switching networks and wanting something new Even though she dropped it and the screen did crack the phone still works amazingly waiting for the insurance cost to go down to get it fixed She isnt the kindest towards devices and puts them through their paces With that being said this phone has held up to her abuse minus the screen Simply sitting on desk for 2 hrs  battery goes from 100 to 85  Drains faster if actually using phone  Cant get a full day of modest use no streaming video or other big power draws  just checking email check weather use Google maps for a couple of minutes not ongoing navigation

By contrast my previous phone has drained 40 in 8 days of sitting idle Very pleased with device I really like the monthly payment plan The Samsung Switch made it very easy to get started on my new phone After using the Samsung Galaxy S7 for only 2 days I noticed the cell phone would get excessively hot after being on the phone for an extended amount of time while playing a game It got so hot I thought it could be another Samsung phone that would catch fire For that reason I turned off the phone and inserted the charging cable Since the Samsung charger is fast charging it would charge up to 100 relatively quickly With each time I would turn on the cell phone it would take a shorter amount of time for the case to become really hot On the 4th day the cell phone battery would drain at the rate of 2  per minute and whats worse the charger was no longer functioning Even after going through all the troubleshoot procedures the charging issue was not solved Maybe the Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone and maybe I got stuck with a lemon but let this review serve as documentation of what could happen Awesome phone Tons of cool and useful features Easy to use not a brick what else could ya ask for My 1st smartphone and still trying to figure it out  so many preloaded apps and its confusing   Im sure once I figure it out and can put all the apps I dont use on a different page because you cant delete them I will be fine with it Its okay but for the money it could be better The reps lied to me to get a sale and then didnt follow through with what they said hey would do This is not the typerson of phone I wanted this  is all they had at the time  An it cost too much for what I have to pay Its a good phone just wish it was cheaper Its fa start and comes equipped with a lot of good apps Phone is similar to old phone Nice upgrades to features and overall look of the phone The screen protectors on the market do not fit the slight contour of the screen very well and affect screen sensibility somewhat As my first activated smart phone its done better than any smart phone any of my friends or family have ever had The call quality is great it performs way better than my old phone Ive always loved Samsung and they really nailed it with this one Does not pair up with my car Bluetooth Ongoing issue not resolved yet Bad quality voice while on phone Resolved by turning off advanced calling  Otherwise I love the phone I think many more options than my S5 Phone is a replacement for an LG G4 that died unexpectedly  As such the S7 is a little small compared to the G4 which I thought really nailed the sweet spot on size  The S7 also seems a little jittery or laggy at times compared to the G4  Was afraid to buy another LG product after mine failed prematurely allegedly due to corrupted files in a software update and LGs failure to stand behind its product Great device really fast and responsive opens apps very quickly and I can surf the Web and watch videos without interruptions it has so much you can do with it i think i made the best choice upgrade This is my first smart phone and I absolutely love it The only feature that drives me nuts is the sensitivity of the touch There is no setting to turn down and many times in just setting it down I accidentally open several apps Recently I visited a Forum for the Samsung 7edge and found someone that had downloaded a 3rd party app called TOUCH SCREEN BOOSTER It totally solved the over sensitivity problem I also found that for me the edge was a waist of  that I never use Thia phone has been my favorite that i have ever had The ezpandable storage is amazing and the featurea are out od this world Mirrored thw new app Full Screen to my smart tv and can watch as much as i want with no data or wifi used Hope the s8 is even better or ill keep this one for a lomg time This phone is a great upgrade from the older device Ive had for years
The Galaxy S7 now allows me to install apps that the prior phone wasnt able to support
This phone also has many new features I didnt know were available Now I can share more stuff between my Samsung Galaxy Tab E laptop and this phone
I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants the latest features for a responsible price Upgraded recently from the S5 to the S7 and I am glad that I did The S5 was a great phone but the S7 is more user friendly and processes all the features quickly This new phone is sleek durable and looks great Ive also been happy with the service reception Great phone Good features just network issues  Keypad to sensitive My 7 active previous phone was a little better Great phone Excellent features Great battery life Easy to use Went from a droid to this phone So glad I did I love having a galaxy 7 bc I  really loved my galaxy 5 I still have a great deal to learn But overall Im pleased The S7 Edge is a good phone so far It was an easy transition from my M8 I am still getting used to the S7 though Super similar to the Galaxy S5 phone
Some minor changes but otherwise the same
LOVE the extra space Just upgraded from a Galaxy s5 to the Galaxy 7  Easy and smooth transition  The camera and extra storage is great The camera is great The battery life is great Smartswitch made it simple to transfer all info from old device Nearly all my previous photo set ups contacts and features transferred I like the power charging feature Charges take less time and battery life seems better It was easy to transition to this from my previous phone It is much faster and has a lot  better battery life than the one I used to have Galaxy 7 is nice but Im still learning it I appreciate how quickly it charges but its quite  different from the galaxy 4 ALOT bigger which is a pro and a con 

It sometimes lags a bit which makes me wonder if these are refurbished and not actually new 
I definitely encourage looking at youtube videos to see different features the phone offers

One complaintannoyance is the charge screen shows an advertisement and Im not sure how to get it off A great value for the camera alone Camera is everything i was hoping it would be with dslr setting and low light setting Pictures are practically professional quality As a heavy phone user the battery life is barely sufficient By the end of the day it is at 15 percent It has only died on me once or twice Fast and smooth operating No complaints Great night photos  Easy to use for the most part Only thing I hate about this thing is I have to charge it twice a day with moderate usage I traded from the s5 to the s7 and love it    wife traded her s5 for the Motorola z force droid and she hates it  Its too big has no headphone jack so has to worry about losing a stupid cord to attach her earphones when shes at the gym  And it doesnt compare to the galaxy phones features arent as cool only if you spend extra money on mods After having this device for a long time it has performed wonders and theres no need for any other My phone has been Easy to learn how to use I am 72 and old school I have a lot to learn  a manual  would be nice The Galaxy S7 is a nice upgrade from my Galaxy S4 The phone is sleek and stylish I bought it in gold tone I like the Always On Display feature so I can quickly see the time and date on the standby screen The camera is awesome It is fast and captures great images I gave it 4 stars because I think the battery should last longer I had a Galaxy S4 so going to the S7 was a no Brainerd I like the phone Takes a little getting use to it little changes but no big deal The Samsung S7 is easy to use My old Samsung was 5 yrs old so I was concerned about the new technology It took no time when I felt comfortable using it This is my first smart phone  It makes me feel a little dumb but I can do the most basic things fairly easily  Its a work in progress  Since Im new to this type of phone so Im not able to know if the design features and performance is good The Droid platform to me is nice The only criticism I have is the battery life lasts roughly 810 hours Thats with Bluetooth off and using WiFi for connectivity I  have only had this phone a week and prefer my old phone The functionality and capabilities are not as good as the galaxy s6 Overall this is a  good phone I have never had any problems out of Samsung products Only thing I dont like is you cant change the battery A lot of different features I have to get use to It is a very sensitive phone I keep accidently going into an app I dont mean to
Overall when I get used to it it should be fine Great phone service Sales Representative was great   The last one was the best  Been a Verizon customer for 15 years Not planning on changing now I have a samsung galaxy s7 and it is so much better then the s5 Its a little bit more bigger and playing games on it is a lot better and not to talk about the gigabytes 32 a lot more then the s5 down side is it doesnt have a place to put an SD card but other then that I would recommend this phone to anyone Also you will love taking pictures Moving up from a Samsung tab a I find that adding a phone to the mix slow me down a lot This devise is going to toke me a long time to master After spending two comfortable years with the S4 I was apprehensive of having to start all over with a new phone Enter a wonderful Verizon Rep at the local store who answered all my questions and was there for me when I needed help with a few of the newer bells and whistles I am one week into the new ownership and am loving it Its fast durable and fun to work with I love the ease of moving apps from page to page The phone wouldnt charge and just shut down had to take it back to have them try to get it back on line  They originally told me to take it to a larger store to have them see if they could do anything with it  Then all of the sudden it started working again Really happy with the switch to the Samsung Galaxy S7 from my iphone  Its more logical for me as I come from a Windows and Google background  The apple platform just never made sense to me and my new Galaxy is so much easier to useThe screen is very clear and sharp Sound quality is great and I can back up my pictures easily into my Google Cloud Im enjoying everything about my phone so much better then the other phones Ive ever had through out the years Ive had samsung phones pretty much since ive had a cell phone I switched from the note 5 which i thought was an awesome phone The camera on this phone is pretty amazing The pictures are so clear and focused  Other than that they are pretty similar phones The only thing that i miss sometimes is the pen but i still like this phone better Its fast beautiful and comfortable to use Its probably the best phone Ive owned so far out of around 6 The only complaint I have is that it seems like I cant add YouTube or gmail to my home screen even though they are installed on the phonealthough that might just be my ignorance Other than that I love it Like the ease of use and the apps are better than iphone that I had before the only thing is spell check is needed So far so good I just wish Verizon could drop there prices a bit thats all but everything else is great Easy to use Lovely design of the edge I love samsung For the past 5 years I have owned nothing but Samsung phones I had the Note 2 the Note 5 and now the S7 I do really like the 7s although it is a little smaller than the Note Its easy to use and takes great pictures Verizon has always worked for me Many moons ago I had a tracking and then kept upgrading Never fail connections or service I upgraded from galaxy 6 that had ALOT of issues So far this phone seems to be working well I can download apps and even use them big improvement from what I had I used to be an iPhone person but 2 years ago switch to the Samsung Galaxy S5 and found it to be more user friendly Recently I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Im still in love The phone is not user friendly and I had to spend about 3 hours with customer 
support before I could receive a call  My previous device was a Nokia not an Apple I love this new phone and the Camersmy last one was a s4 so I knew how functions work    Easy transition and I love this slick look Can not get it to hook up to my blue tooth in my car with the radio but can talk through blue tooth very aggravating would not have got this if I new about the issues galaxy was having with the bluetooth I went back to the Galaxy S series after a few years with the Motorola Droid I am completely satisified with everything the phone has to offer except the battery life I have to charge it atleast twice a day Thank goodness for the rapid charge feature  I really dont feel like I use it as much as others but the battery drains really fast Im not a big app user My biggest use is on facebook while looking at pics However even being idle at night it rapidly drains Ive turned off most of my notifications too  Anyway the size is perfect for me  not too big not too small Its got everything I need and more the product is greatI like the featuresand something I have not seen in a while was my being to transfer my information from my old phoneI was very impressed with that feature I was a little concern about not having access to the battery but after speaking with the rep he assured of the quality of the S7 phones battery Good phone Great functionality and ease of use The only reason not to give 5 stars was because I need to fill up the required number of characters to post a review If you are coming from the Note 7 Dont waste your time with this phone It sucks compare to the Note 7 Wait for the Note 8 You will be glad that you did If you are in need of a big phone Try the iPhone 7 plus Still learning the ins and outs of this phone Hmmnot great battery life but WAY more memory than I had on my last phone Some of my go to buttons changed around a little but thats mischief managed with time Not sure if I care for the new placement of the headphones jack it used to be on top but now its next to the charge cable jack The memory is a lot more accessible but how often does one change that and what if you lose the tool to open the panel I previously had the 6Edge which I really liked I have several friends who also have the 7 and we agree it has some definite pluses and minuses
PLUSES
The camera is great
More memory and expandable capacity is awesome
 MINUSES
It is difficult to use the keyboard to text input info etc It seems to be slow in recognition of letters touched
It heats up quickly if used continously The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone  I especially love the wireless charging feature with the charging stand  The dual camera is a very nice feature also  The size of the phone fits my hand isnt so large that it is difficult to carry with me at all times  Please keep this phone available in the future Ive had the Samsung Galaxy 3 5 and now 7 each one a little better then the last You cant beat the picture quality Excellent screen image quality Nice applications newer applications Better speed Battery life is very good I like wireless charging a lot The phone is about the same as the S5 I expected more of an upgrade  The camera is a lot better though  The issue I had with the phone that drove me crazy is the ads that would appear on the screen when I plugged it in to charge it  It took a couple of calls to customer service to figure out why the ads were appearing and it turned out it wasnt any of the apps that I downloaded it was the Zcamera app that was on the phone when I got it This phone has been incredible for its sleek design it is durable and runs faster than I couldve imagined This product is awesome if you are a smart person and this is also good for business communications Since making the switch to a smartphone I have stayed with the Samsung Galaxy line This is my 3rd upgrade and dont foresee changing brands in the future either The HD sound when making a call is so clear and defined I upgraded basically because my S4 was only 16GB and I ran out of room and the battery life was not as good as I wanted I love the 32GB I have in the 7S and so far the battery life is wonderful The display is clear and the colors are bright The screen size is perfect I didnt want a larger phone so I chose the S7 over the S7 Edge The S7 is still new to me but I am looking forward to exploring some new features Love the design and ease of use so far have not lost or dropped calls where I previously have before with other carriersdefinitely  recommend this to all my friends Im a late bloomer to the smart phones The Samsung Galaxy S7 IS my second Android 
I find it very easy to use  The APPS are similar to my HTC one but only a million times faster The pictures are incredible Im pretty new to this but so far I really like it I cant see a lot of difference in my new S7 and my old S5 The screen is difficult to use neat the edges Have to press the area several times before it is accepted Had to look up instructions online to find where flashlight is located no app for it Everyone loves apple products but android does not try to be better it is better because its more reliable Great phone Was a seamless transition from my S6 It is light and fast My S7 has really good sound quality All the same features ando more Samsung is not the leader of any game Not happy and stuck with it Not 30 days like I was told originally Only 14 one of the most compelling smartphones on the market with lots of new feature improved battery performance and a consistent and dependable camera I absolutely hate the soft keys next to the home button
I also hate the fact that there isnt ANY tempered glass screen protectors out there that will cover the entire screen
Also my alarm and ring tones changed on their own on the 2nd or 3rd day that I had the phone Decent phone Ease of use is good  Still wouldnt recommend the phone     Other phones were better Had to pick this one I am so glad I did not get another Motorola because I absolutely love this phone  I feel it is the ultimate  I would challenge any Iphone owner Was not too happy with the store employee He rushed me through set up my email for Gmail which I did not want I wanted to be set up using the Samsung email The phone is in a class by itself Quick and responsive processor and flawless design The phone preforms better than iphone 7 Everything transferred from old phone easily Some apps dont work on the new phone Excellent camera So far its good Just got it and I like it The graphics are great brightness is great I LOVE IT Does what I need it to do and I especially love the BIOMETRIC unlocking I was sort of forced in to an early upgrade because Verizon did not want to do a sixth replacement on my Sony Xperia  I really dont like this phone AT ALL  It has fewer features that I used on the Sony it has a horrible camera I went from a 20 MP to a 10 MP that is grainy the phone gets very hot and doesnt charge via the USB port in my vehicle people say they cant hear me on the phone that it cuts in and out just over all not happy with it 

NOTE My previous device is not listed on your pull down menu so I just chose a Samsung but it was a Sony Xperia Z3 Great features Awesome video recording and photo taking This review was collected as part of a promotion Had a note 3 loved the phone very user friendly the screen got shattered so in the way of cell phone time to upgrade First the phone fell 1 foot onto carpet the back shattered second the touch screen Is extremely unresponsive and very small third the battery life sucks charge all night unplug it 3 hours later needs charged again The photo gallery is very hard to organize it is not user friendly the colors for message are limited if you want a great phone they dropped the ball on this one  I thoroughly enjoy this device
I am a technician for another phone company and work on their devices every day This device greatly out performs anything they have out

The only thing I dislike is that I want audio to output on both speakers when I hold it sideways Dont know what to say I have had a Samsung Galaxy since the S4 so this is just the next step after my S5 what can I say I hate Apple This was one of the smaller phones offered in the store but it still does not fit easily in my hand Android technology same asize my old phone but it seems like there are more steps to get something accomplished than before I hate it Heyonly 2 more years tho grrrr Like looks of phone the clear easy to read display and ease of use I had purchased the Note 7 and then exchanged it and then had to return the second one I ended up with the 7 Edge which was very similar but without the pen Awesome picture quality  Its not huge and bulky the pictures are beautiful and full of vibrant color  Very happy with my choice in phone It was average transition and I think the phone is functioning as expected  It took two tries to transition all contacts and there seemed no pattern or explanation to what was not transferred  Im glad I live close to the purchase point so I didnt have to make a long trip to get it done a second time HAD THE GALAXY 6 ACTIVE BEFORE THIS AND SEEMS ONLY DIFFERENCE IS I CAN ADD A SD CARD FOR MORE MEMORYTHANKFULLY LOVE THE GALAXY PHONES THIS IS MY THIRD PHONE WITH SAMSUNG 
ONLY REASON I UPGRADED TO 7 IS DUE TO A SOFTWARE GLICH ON MY 6 ACTIVE SINCE THE 6 WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY 2 MONTHS SAMSUNG WOULD NOT REPAIR DUE TO THE FREEZE I knew I should have stuck with the iPhone  Everyone was talking up the Galaxy S7 and I thought I would try it  How bad could it be  Ive been very unhappy with the phone  It is for sure not as user friendly as the iPhone  The Android version of all my apps are riddled with ads so annoyingly so that it is difficult to do just about anything on the phone  The ads automatically come up then when I try to X out of it it takes me completely out of what I was trying to get into in the first place  Battery life was good the first week but now doesnt hold a charge for the day  Nobody can figure out why my battery is draining so fast  Im NOT a heavy cell user at all  The camera is pretty cool and takes good pics and the sound quality of the earpiece on a call is better than the iPhone  I tried to exchange it for the iPhone 7 Plus but I was on vacation for a week and lost track of time and by the time I returned my 14 days were up  Now Im stuck for 2 years Samsung doe not stand behind their products  Would not replace faulty product in the first month  They expect you to mail in phone for repair  Long time user of Samsung phones  They must be having financial trouble for the issues with their other products   
Bad customer service  The parrot back their policy I like my phone still getting used to the new programs however the one feature it doesnt have that I liked with my S4 was the Hands free feature On that phone I just turned the feature on It would announce to me who was calling or texting also would read the message back without having to turn my bluetooth on with the S7 all Hands free does is read the message back with blue tooth As a safety issue the hands free was something I used all the time very disappointed the way this is set  up
   Thank you for listening to my complaint I like the design of the phone It is similar to the Galaxy S5 that I previously had so not to much learning curve The one thing I really dont like is the battery drains quickly Ivery only had the phone just over a week but so far looking good Smart lock feature is awesome and security features give you piece of mind Also the battery life has been really good Phone is very nice in performance  battery life Not particularly pleased with the updated apps that the S7 installed during setup I have not been able to get phone to behave like my S5 did  camera talk picture gallery Some downloaded documents did not transfer at all Several questions about why certain features behaved the way they did and how to chanel behaviour could not be answered by Verizon staff Faster and better screen resolution than S5 and S6 more options better camera and blue tooth connection I was a huge fan of the Nokia Lumia line of phones but Verizon stopped carrying the upgrades for this line and the selection of Windows apps was dismal Switching to this phone has been great  there are an indefinite number of apps for Google Play its userfriendly and it has some great capabilities with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A While I feel that my Nokia Lumia took better nighttime photos I am overall happy with this phones camera and the ease with which I can turn data wifi and location on and off and the power save mode all which help save on battery life There is very little that I miss from my old phone  mostly a couple of games specific to WindowsXbox Every app I had on that phone there are at least 5 similar offerings on Google Play Also love that it isnt too large for my small girlhands to hold Only miss my larger screen and pen with Samsung Note 5  Thats all I have to note A tremendous upgrade from my S5 simply put better in every way  But still way too early for me to make a valid review This Samsung 7 is not like my first Samsung 7 and Im disappointed by it  there were features on the first phone thats not on here Firstly my expectations may have been high since it was among the top 3 phones available at the time  I was struck by the poor quality of the camera especially since it was touted as one of the best  I actually thought I mustve  had a plastic film over my camera to protect it in transit  It did not  I took several side by side shots with the g4 and s7 and the g4 seemed much more detailed  The s7 was better in low light by far  Also the s7 was faster much faster  I was disappointed in the swipe function on my eBay app which only seemed to work when it wanted to  I also noticed that this phone seemed to be designed to be held in the left hand  I hold mine right handed and find the button location irritating  I also find the edges of the screen to be very sensitive to unwanted touch just from holding the phone my fingers would make contact with the slightly curved edges  I will say to its benefit the WiFi works incredibly  My g4 suffered from terrible WiFi connectivity  This may be the only reason I havent returned this device  My g4 stopped working for no apparent reason and that was the only reason for the upgrade  I will be waiting for a better phone to release and will be trading this in asap pretty gold phone but too long Texting feature wont let up see if your sent message was delivered on the screen immediately my old core prime showed that Dialing while driving can be touchy more steps to make a call or check on stuff Its an okay phone This is an excellent value cellphone with a lot of nice features Really good phone The onboard features are great and fun to use such as being able to make the screen smaller and shift to the side for one handed use Runs all my apps with ease Easy to use and fun to navigate with just the right amount of buttons you need Once you get used to the format its a breeze getting around and easy to clear the cache I like that it works the same way as my Samsung 96 tablet so no added learning curve Im very impressed with how easy it is to operate Especially since I am not very tech savvy There is no need for me to be reluctant Wonderful phone all around Really enjoy the VR netflix the phone has Lots of great custom options to choose from Apps hardly ever fail or slow learned that the US models actually have snapdragon processers so thats pretty cool enjoy the new features Easy to use Battery life appears to be longer than previous phone Overall a great phone I had the Galaxy Note 3 and was talked into get the Note 7 or thought it was time to update Well we all know what happened to the Note 7 and so they gave me the S7 and just not happy with the phone at all and I believe it has to do with the size I really do miss the screen size of the Note 3 and I still use it for most everything around the house  Disappointed Compared to my HTC M8 this phone seemed to lack an appealing operating system to me I traded this phone for an I Phone 7 only because of my current work situation Had it not been more or less a requirement for work I would have traded it for an HTC 10 The HTC Sense operating system is far superior to any other phone that I have utilized Its OK Im not a big technology person I just need to get use to a Samsung phone its the first one Ive had My son got the phone last Friday night  He didnt drop the phone  however on Sunday his brother saw a crack on his screen he turned the phone over and it was cracked on the back as well After researching online  it appears this has been an issue  however  when my son was picking between 2 phones he wasnt told about the phones potential for cracking  Im less than impressed with bother Samsung and Verizon  If the problem cant be remedied I will have no other choice but to switch carriers Transparent upgrade from the Galaxy 6s fasterbetter camera and my Otterbein fits Take advantage of the upgrade promo if your galaxy 5 or 6 is paid for Phone is nice online purchase bad Called customer svc also bad Very disappponted with customers sby rep Not helpful Love it The only problem I have is the charge port doesnt have a cover on it like the S5 I just swapped from Ill admit that Im not very tech savvy and my prior phone iPhone really made me feel dumb 
I was always bugging anyone I knew that had one with so many questions 
I counted down the days until I was eligible for an upgrade 
My son and sister both have Samsung phones and had told me on numerous occasions that I would be much happier with one 
I now have the Samsung GalaxyS7 and I love it 
Its only been a week but I feel like I already have mastered so much more on this phone than the other one I had for years I would say the drawback is the signal strength in my neighborhood but I will give Verizon a break on this because I am in a heavily wooded area and the signal gets a little better within a mile of home This phone has a better display and speaker than my S4 The camera makes better quality pictures Easy to operate Split screen is a winner and battery and power  saving features are simply awesome  Love the screen clarity and sharp camera I have had issues with this phone since the moment I got it The Sim card did not work no email contacts did not transfer Spent 40 min talking to Jack in SC yesterday No one can hear when they call unless I am on speaker Yesterday I got a call about a death in family I was so embarrassed that they could not hear me One of the most amazing smartphones on the market with a few amazing features like always on display or call your friend quickly and the best is water resistant I upgraded from an S4 to an S7 and I really love this phone  I love the finergprint ID feature to unlock the phone and many of the other features of this phone Its a measurable improvement on the S5 in performance faster more memory  The look is good also  However it would be easier to handle if it had a textured back and sides  Compared to the S5 it seems too slippery  This may be a feature intended to promote the sale of a protective cover but I find such covers decrease the ease of handling even more than the slippery back This is a great phone It is easy to use I love the in the gold color This is my 3rd Galaxy home and Ive been very happy with every one of them I highly recommend this phone The screen is nice and clear Easy to use the set up is easy I really like the Samsung Galaxy S7 My information was put on to my new phone with no problem
I did not lose any of my pictures or contacts I am a happy customer My S7 is replacing an S4 It a bit larger but is still ergonomically friendly for my carpal tunnel The only feature that took a little getting used to is the change in what the left soft key does Lovely design beautiful display S4 was a workhorse for me Based on my experience the S7 promises to be the same This phone is very easy to use even for a beginner It also has a great camera with fun camera features Overall Perfect for most thing such as multitasking Taking Photos and much more the Edge screen is really nifty for calling people and your flashlight and checking new and notifications Love It and cannot wait for the s8 Edge Nice switch from ATT when I started working in a cell dead zone in rural NE  All good and easy  Mike Great phone  East to transfer my info even from an S3  Stick with Samsung  Have an Iphone for work and the Galaxy S7 blows it away I really enjoy the phone so much i bought a second one Thank you for great technology Battery life is terrible if and when you need to use features other than texting or making and receiving phone calls  Youll have to charge the phone at least twice a day if you need to learn how to use a smart phone  The Verizon Store sold me an otter box  It is very uncomfortable to hold and use  Phones should be made less breakable without having to install at otter box protective cover I have only had this phone for 4 days but I am enjoying the sleek design and learning about the new features I have not used the camera yet but have heard that the quality produced is amazing I am currently working on finding out about the new features I love the included USB Adapter which can be used to transfer data access USB drives or attach other USB devices However if you have a case you will probably have to remove it to use the adapter I was amazed to find out that you can attach a USB or wireless keyboard to your device If you are using your phone to remotely write blog posts what a frustration saver
The first thing I was frustrated with was that it was very easy to accidentally touch the screen on the edge when I didnt want to Using a case took care of that problem so it is not ongoing for me As awesome as it is I feel it is higher priced than it needs to be but as you can see I still paid the price I wish they werent full of the bloatware from the manufacturer the carrier and google It drives me nuts Its not as user friendly for office work and even for construction use as my note was I am struggling with this phone and hope I can become more efficient as time goes on I would only recommend this phone to someone not using it for detailed work purposes This phone replaced a wellloved LG G3 so far  it has been a great choice  I love the features and it was an easy transition I chose this phone because I thought it would be a great choice but I honestly dont like it very much I loved my old phone but the screen messed up on it so I had to get a new phone I prefer my old phone over this one This is easily the best cell phone on the market Nice design clean user interface and a load of unique features A little expensive but the quality is unbeatable This should come with a wireless base charger AND a tool to get in the memory card compartment I dont know how to access the card Comfortable classy looking lovely functions fits well in hand tempered glass front very easy to use Im a fan of Samsung phones  However more for the geek in mind Try it if you dont mind the challenge This is a great phone overall This is my first Galaxy and I have been very impressed Have had a few battery issues but was fixed quickly Alright good OK the phones are alright The  towers get u out there Up north they are goodservice ok I switch from the iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy This ohone n is very easy to use The one feature that I love is the time showing on the screen without having to hit the home button It seems to be able to pick up signals better than the other phones that Ive had The only thing that has given me problems could be more networking than the actual device Ive had the new phone for a week and Im not impressed with the battery life or screen protector I thought a new phone would be better than the Galaxy 5s I just had it seems to drain fast  Also the screen protector in the store doesnt even cover the screen all the way about an 18 of an inch on each side isnt covered Love this phone and would and do recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a new phone                              I think the s5 was cool but not as cool as the s7 better quality faster cool down speed built in flashlight My phone was sitting on top of a soda can It fell off the can onto the granite counter and now the case is cracked This is the second phone the first one never made it out of the store  The screen cracked while the sales person was activating the phone

I also have issues with my phone being way to hot after charging Ill be honest and say it is not every time but way to many compared to other phones

No warranty for any damage Handle with care Beautiful phone and amazing display To bad that no effort was put into case and glass face design trying to get into the smartphone age of doing thingshad to have Granddaughter show me how to do somethings and i figured how to do others it is easy to use once i get started Great Phone I am very pleased with the S7 I came from iPhones and ios The Samsung is head and shoulders above the iPhone No issues switching to the android platform Highly recommend Only drawbacks are battery life could be a little better Slightly larger phone than I would prefer but excellent battery life and a brilliant highresolution screen  Great that it is waterresistant would like to have an unbreakable screen as well  The SD card slot is fantastic adding 200GB storage I had a 4 and the 7 is so much better The camera security proformance is great The best smartphone at the moment I hope that S8 it will be better than S7 Easy to use  Seamless transition from S5 to S7 and from previous provider to Verizon Greattach new features Better battery life nice having a wireless charger but I cannot upload pictures from my phone to my computer phone is fast with good amount of storage The phone is very slick so I cover is important if you do not want it to slip out of your hand Love the wireless charging I like the extras that are on this model meaning less apps to download I like the fast charging too Purchased  at costco loving device until  I made a couple calls on speakerphone  and the recipient  couldnt  hear Frustrating  to say the least Easy to use Good reps working at the store Good selection of phone to choose from tooSwitching to Verizon was easy It has all the bells and whistles youd expect except the phone lasts about as long as my old 6 did I would expect a new phone to be a bit longer lasting than an older one Ive grown up with Samsung have had mostly every modelthen came the S7 Ive had so many problems that its hard for support to remember let alone remedy Ive been trying to work through themand I assure you Im no novice So far everything has been to no avail Im not sure if I got a problem child or theyre all like this but Ill soon be in a Verizon store either changing it for a different one or trying the other 7 I had a note 4 and it was nearly flawless but apparently its still flying the friendly skies of United To make this shorter Im not a happy camper I just purchased a new modemrouter to see if it would take less than 3 minutes to open a page as well as not at all Its fast but didnt help the phone any I had to get this phone through insurance because my other phone got dropped in water Compared to my Note5 I hate this phone Its small and the screen cover comes up on the sides even with store install on the screen protector I wanted an iphone 7 so it compared in size but through insurance they have to stay with the same manufacture I hate this phone I wanted to like this phone more my last phone was a 2011 vintage LG   I find the haptic system doesnt recognize taps around the periphery well  consistently which results in a lot of retyping  I think part of the problem could be the screen protector   The fingerprint sensing only seems to work 25 of the time  Even though its on Verizon I dont find the coverage that great  I didnt have coverage when another friend w Verizon did  I had to reset the phone for it to find the network  I dont find the navigation and some of the settings particularly intuitive  the back button in different apps is elusive and somehow I made the font a ridiculous reading for the blind size in 1 of my email apps and cant figure out how to change it back    The positives  Photo quality is good screen is great charges fast Nice size for any application Phone sound is excellent when you make calls in car and also conference calls This phone is fast charges quickly and runs well Good size love the features on it And the gold color is awesome Just upgraded from S6 to the s7 so I do not have it all figured out yet because there is a lot of new features It is light weight but not too small dont know yet how battery life is but will update my review in a month I upgraded my iPhone 6 to a Samsung Galaxy s7 a week ago and it has been an easy transition This phone is simple to use and the battery life is the same as the iPhone great easy to use nice features great apps nice transition from Motorola Mini Droid
lightweight nice platinum color and clear protective case This model is AWESOME

HECK A LOT BETTER THAN THE AMP PRIME I was so annoyed with Sprint 15 year customer after trying to purchase a replacement phone that I decided to go to Verizon a shot  I decided to visit my local store and the entire process took about 20 minutes new phone included  Excellent customer service  I am very pleased with the phone plan and price   Thanks Verizon at Bowie Town Center Phone operation is great Good battery life I have had phone a week and already went through two screen protectors that were temp glass They just Crack so save your money I got a case with a front cover and just will do my best not to drop it I bought this about a week ago and do far my experience is great I love it I would recommend this I bought this phone because my old one broke Its a great phone  I like it but Im concerned every time I charge it The part that gets pugged to my phone gets hot after 5 minutes Great phone  I had a Samsung 4 and this one is quite similar Good quality photos and grsphics Easy to use Enjoying my new phone and its performance Easy to use and operate Love the upgraded camera and new apps I switched services to see if will get better coverage and it is better so farWriting a review for a company that wants you to write over a hundred words is a bit of strech to the imagination I recently had to upgrade my phone from a Galaxy S3 mini I debated on what model to purchase  I am so glad that I decided on the Galaxy S7 With the expanded memory  new technology I know that this phone will be with me for a long time I would absolutely recommend this to anyone in need of a new phone Bought two weeks ago and am pleased with it  It is a very good phone  The staff was very helpful   I like the phone but it seems to lose battery life quicker than it should and loads web pages somewhat slow Love my S7 runs great Small and big at the same time Battery life declines USB cords needs to Universal A basic oneeds doesnt work as well as the Samsung cord Finally pulled the trigger and got the upgrade from my S5 Skipped the 6 because I dont like change but finally I broke my screen and felt it was time The S7 is really cool not a huge fan of the price but its no more expensive than any of the other leading phones I ordered  some of thes and cant wait to see some VR women Coming from a iPhone 6 plus I immediately noticed the lightning quick response on this phone and screen clarity Even the sound quality seems to coke through clearer So far its everything I hoped for This review was collected as part of a promotion I brought this for my wife for Christmas but i play with more than she does  Should have got one also  Great phone Upgraded from a Galaxy  S5  Both phones seem similar  Hope this works as well as that one has Nice display and good sound through 35mm jack Phone has good battery life and works great with blue tooth wireless devices without loss of connection The ear peace volume or port has low and broken sound at times Hard to hear the other party even with the volume maxOther than that been a great phone so far  The Galaxy S7 is impressive as all galaxy phones tend to be It seems a bit large at first but one gets used to it quite easily The screen has brilliant resolution and the speed of the processor is outstanding Its more like a small computer than a phone The only thing that could be better is the external speaker It needs to be able to get louder than it does Otherwise a great product Had to upgrade to this model after damaging my phone in a car accident I like this upgrade happy with it so far The phone is strong and well built for that unfortunate drop without a case and not cracking the screen Photo optionsmodes are like I have not seen on phones before So far so good From S4 to S7 But it doesnt have a car charger included After looking at all my options I landed on the S7  All the reviews were right the phone is everything I expected and more This is the best phone I have ever owned I like everything about it Especially the edge features This phone takes time to learn I think you will like it Needs a better battery the remote control feature needs to be brought back very high quality cameras front and rear The price is overkill considering what was left out on this model that was offered in the previous galaxy phones My first smart phone was a Motorola Droid I stayed with that model and stayed up to date with the newer versions as they were released After 10 yrs I went with the Samsung Galaxy S7 I should have done it sooner I love the Android OS Easily transfer all info apps pictures downloads etc from old phone to this one Bigger screen and easier to see Easy to see screen in bright daylight From out of the box this phone was easy to set up and update More feature than my old S5 and all the apps run well without issues Good buy for the performance it has given This review was collected as part of a promotion Changing from IPhone to Android is an experience  Overall IPhone is simpler and more userfriendly  However after reviewing the features I opted for an Android  Still getting used to it  Phone is thin and easy to hold in my smaller hand  Great camera I dont use my phone that much 23 hours of pandora and 15 hours of talking  My battery was down to 14 after a full charge and the above usage  Not what I expected from a new phone The S7 is much lighter than my previous phone and it feels a lot better in my hand  The speaker is also good quality I love everything about the phone Its smaller than my S5 but soo much faster The only negative I have is the battery drains very quickly I was really hoping for a powerful battery and this one doesnt hack it It is somewhat offset by a rapid charging charger It only takes about 15 hours for a full charge The only reason for such a low rate is the battery Only have had the phone for a week and am in love with it the only thing is it could have better battery life Although I wasnt a big fan of my Galaxy S4 I went ahead and purchased the S7 on a lark and because I was tired of being bugged about upgrading So far its not bad The settings are just as nonintuitive as the S4 or actually more so Good camera and screen resolution Love it  Its  pretty and has great features  Easy to you for a non techy person  Meets my needs perfectly I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my LG G2 I wish I had my old phone back Ive had the phone for 6 months and the pixels have started dying The Verizon tech said it was probably caused from pressure on the screen and that the phone isnt as durable as I was previously lead to believe Hate it If I had known I would have stayed with LG This is an amazing phone First and foremost I love the customizability of it Its quite literally a personal companion down to the nitty gritty Transferring information from the iOS was easy too Unlike iTunes Samsung is made to be a compatible devise per each individual user I love this phone Obviously being waterproof is an outstanding perk I used to think the battery life of the iOS was something to be proud of but the galaxy s7 has a tremendous battery life and charges 100 faster That helps so you dont go to bed with your phone plugged in and when its done charging it doesnt just continually burn up the battery You charge it as its needed and thats that So far I have yet to find anything I dislike about the Samsung Galaxy s7 Highly recommend this phone Bought phone 15 was ago  I had a Note 3 Really liked the larger screen  Overall size and thickness Am having trouble with fingers rolling onto the screen causing miscues etc  But I do like the speed Upgraded my phone Good choice We have used Verizon since they came to TX Would no think of using another phone I replaced an iPhone 5c with this Samsung  It has taken me some time to get used to the differences and get it set up to my satisfaction  The battery life is very short compared to the iPhone  Normal usage is mostly texts maybe 2025 a day and a couple of 23 minute phone callnever used for video or music and I have to charge it  every day  If I had it to do over I would get another iPhone I was very happy with it Ive always loved my Samsung phones and products This is the first time Ive ever been so anxious to get rid of a phone My husband and I both got the S7 Edge when it came out Within 3 months his screen cracked He nor I have ever damaged a previous phone and especially not a Samsung phone We constantly have failed text messages so I have no idea whos texted me verses what I actually receive on the phone And its usually about a 5050 chance of whether or not a picture included with a message will go through Occulus is ALWAYS updating and I dont even use the VR Id love to be able to take that off but cant The fact that this phone is so expensive for this type of quality Samsung just turned into every other smart phone company in my book Im so very disappointed I have had all of the SAMSUNG galaxy phones starting with the original all the way to the S7 I cannot wait for the S8 IPhones suck Nice phone just getting to know it and what it can do Also got a a Samsung gear fit 2 so this should be fun with more functionality than what I previously had before I traded my Droid Maxx and am very pleased I upgraded to my Galaxy S7 easy to use setup and enjoy Only negative so far is it is a bit slippery getting it out of holster case Otherwise I recomend I have had my Galaxy S7 for less then a week now and I have to admit  for the first 2 or 3 days I was pretty hesitant about keeping it  However I am now sold on the phone  It can do so much more then my previous iPhone 6s and it has a lot more power behind it  

The switch over which I thought was going to be very difficult was actually pretty simple and I was able to do it compleatly from home  Yes even switching over my contacts I love the service The phone is great I had a s7 before and really like it The transition to Verizon was great the only problem is it takes so long to get the gift cards to cover the final bill with Sprint Theres no way theyll wait 8 weeks to get paid Great phone that is intuitive fast feature filled and really advances the Samsung brand Fast charging is really quick battery life is longer than I had expected and taking pictures is awesome with all the features included Using the edge side of the phone takes some learning but works nicely Highly recommend I have had this phone a week I do like it
I dont like my bill Way too high It goes up all the time I bought the phone a week ago and I am so satisfied with the phone  Excellent camera and features My only issue with this phone is the lack of themes that are not as bright but still provide easy access and use without a bunch of colorful  garbage  I also like the S Edges increased size but was too worried about destroying that screen and finding a useful screen protector I upgraded from an s4 on ATT to this Better phone Better network Idk if theres any correlation but Im happy with both I love the Samsung Galaxy 7 I am so glad I chose this phone It is easy to use and the features  are nice Bought the phone because the battery would not stay charged on my Motorola Prefer Motorola but they were not available It appears to be a good phone Found a good deal for this phone Glad I bought it Very nice phone Easy steps to activate and import my profile contacts and applications from my existing phone Very nice camera display ease of use battery backupEverything is good about the phone Havent had it long enough yet like it so far Dont have 100 characters about the phone yet let me use it for a while will ya  Same as old phone no new updates Nothing interesting or great about the phone so basic and photo quality is sub par We had a Samsung S4 and upgraded to the new S7 Galaxy and what a difference Ease of operation and many new features along with an outstanding camera The clarity of the camera is better than my daughters iPhone I had a G4 and it started giving out I use it for personal and business and needed significantly more strength So the next option was the G7  I couldnt be happier with this phone It gives me everything I need and then some I bought this phone because my S6 was almost a year and a half old and was beginning to act up  You know the batter started heating up and it wouldnt keep a charge so I decided to buy the S7 because I loved my S6  By what a disappointment this phone is  You cant hear anyone on the other side of the receiver when making a call or receiving a call you hear terrible feed back and echos  It is even worse when trying to use the speaker phone or my blue tooth  The service dept has tried to help fix it and so far hasnt had any luck  I went on a trip and used the GPS Google Maps App  I use this all the time on my S6  The S7 sent me in complete circles telling me to go straight and then make a Uturn  It got so bad that my client who was following me had to put the address we were going to into his phone and I had to follow him  I am so disappointed with this phone  I cant wait to give it back Its great Its easier to use There is more I can do on this phone I dont have any complaints about the phone Glade I got it I bought this phone because it was the closest one to my old S4 so it has been easy to use The size fits well in my hand or in my n pocket Good phone  Easy to operate  Fast response  Like that its thinner  Easier to enter pin number  Would buy again Very happy I upgraded my phone I would only change the curved sides on phone dont like that part of the phone I just got my new phone and its great I love all the new things I can do on I will keep this phone until it quits on me but I think its going to last a lond time Way better than my old S III Slim and sleek Easy to usejust waiting to see how the battery life holds up Overall I like the phone  I have taken nice photographs and video of my son  Good battery life  But I need to get more tones because I do not like the default ring tone i just got this phone and it has amazing capabilities and smooth navigation through out the entire phone I got my phone a couple of months ago after upgrading from the Galaxy S5 and have no problems with it I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day It all depends on how I use my phone I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy  S5 but havent activate all of them If I had activated all of them then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day  BTW  I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch

I do have minor complaints
1 Not happy with a removable battery It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze This phone hasnt frozen so far
2 Being made of glass More of a risk of being cracked That was one of the reasons why I didnt want the iPhone
3 Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5
4 Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving I had that command when I had a flip phone I forgot which cell phone company had that All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on so why cant a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone

Otherwise I am very happy with the phone It is very easy to use and Verizonwireless customer service is very helpful when I am in a jam We just got these phones last week and we really like them  Good Picture quality and nice sound  The one downside so far is finding a good screen protector  Since the S7 has a slight curve to the edge it is hard to find a tempered glass screen protector that fits properly  most of the ones I have found online only have 3 to 3 12 stars Best product ever Im in love with this phone is amazing I love it because it is basically the same as my s5 but better Doesnt take much to learn how to use it Pretty good I miss the ir blaster from my s5 and battery life has dropped some after using it for a week Just switched from an iPhone 5c because of all the things I dont like about Apple Wanted to give Android a try Im so glad that I did I find it so much more user friendly and Im really happy with it Absolutely love the color of my Galaxy S7 Edge and the size is perfect The transition from one phone to the next is very simple and easy to manipulate around The S7 is what I wanted when I bought my old S4

There are several advantages over my old S4 The responsiveness is vastly improved The extra memory 32G vs 16G allows for many more apps I had hit the limit with the S4 The camera works the way that you would expect a good one to work The one in the S4 was more often than not a disappointment The S7 camera focuses nearly instantaneously and can be set to track and stay focused on the object person hawk flying etc The delay in the S4 was always frustrating and it would often refocus on the wrong object in the frame

One thing to be aware of is the need for a good protective cover The phone is slippery I purchased a Spigen cover with a protective plastic edge that both looks great and is functional It does not cover the side buttons I might switch to one like I had on the S4 that does cover the buttons because it is too easy to accidentally press the power button on the side and wake the phone but thats in the personal preference area The cover should have a ridge above the screen because on the S7 the glass sits proud of the edge exposed in a drop

The battery life is much better than it is in the S4 as well

I can say that I havent found anything negative to report on the S7 itself I wouldnt have any other This phone has all the features I wanted plus more  Its very easy to use and Im very pleased with it I upgraded to this phone as my Droid Maxx was 2 years old and not keeping a charge Well this phone is supposed to be brand new and I have to charge it TWICE a day Ive turned off functions why should I have to do this just to save battery life and it still drains the battery in less than 8 hours and most of that time its not being used Not a happy camper with this phone Is the best phone ever I could not stand my iPhone7 so i switched and now Im very satisfied I got it Dec 30th 2016 and I dont like it but Im stuck with it for two years I wish I could just get another one but I dont think Im allowed this early in my contract but I guess Ill just wait and in two years just go with another provider Love the galaxy phones Ive had an s3 s5 and now s7 I also have a tab a Great interface and dependability The camera is crazy good Easy transfer  Love the folder feature to organize apps  Very similar to older version so transition was user friendly I bought the phone on a friday and by monday i was taking it backno signal and the battery life was sorry Great voice activated camera feature as well as voice activated phone features make this phone super easy to use Always owned a samsung they make a good reliable product would recommend the phone to anyoneIm sure the new one will be as good as the rest the screens have broken on all of my s7 edges I have severalI was told its gorrila glass  its not I am not pleased at all My Motorola Droid Turbo has a broken screen so I upgraded rather than fixing Processor is slightly faster and battery life is slightly less Camera is noticeably higher quality When we received the phone the screen was shattered and was told there was nothing they could do about it This phone is so easy to use Very fast at transferring my information from one phone to another It is a joy to use I would recommend any one to get this phone Upgraded my S5 did not need too it was a great phone but liked that the S7 I got had 34gb Its a little different but Google was my friend in getting it set up like my past Im in love now Ive had my phone for a few days still learning but am very pleased so far I have already experienced the great features such as the camera I switched over from iPhone to Samsung thinking the Galaxy would be a better phone There werent any problems for a little bit but now this phone is becoming a problem Its overheating and the battery goes out really fast Plus it cracks too easily I _thoroughly_ washed my phone along with a small load of laundry It came out of the washing machine still on and functioning and seems to be unaffected The S7 is great  The upgrades to the camera are awesome The low light camera is great  The crispness of the images is excellent The accessories we have for the Galaxy S5 work even better on the S7 Have only had it a week So far I like it I will know better in a few months Really miss a QWERTY keyboard nstead of on screen Old phone wearing out needed a new one and am comfortable and satisfied with Samsung Verizon performance I bought my new phone over the internet about a week ago  I love it so far  Since I had the S4 before this it was so easy to activate and transfer all my information  I am still learning about all its features but I expect to continue to find it a great phone I bought the phones 2 weeks ago only problem is when I text  on the key pad I hit the letters too small The phone gets hot that it is the only negative I love Samsung products just not the battery for the devices Verizon made it very easy to transition to them from Sprint and most of the features and apps I used on my S4 appeared on my new phone in a similar fashion to the old one  The water resistant qualities of the S7 are a nice addition since I often take my kayaking and hiking in inclement weather  Signal strength has been better than Sprint in our home which was an important feature  We have particularly enjoyed using the phone in the Samsung Gear VR Oculus headset Phone tends to overheat and battery doesnt seem to last Thinking about switching phones Would not recommend unless problem gets fixed We bought the gizmo gadget for our 8 year old for Christmas I wasnt too keen on getting him an actual phone so this was a great alternative to buy It works great andhe loves it I love that I can control it at all times from my phone and can Check his location with GPS The only con is that there is not an emergency option You have to enter your local police departments phone number and use that as one of the contacts The s5 gives you the opportunity to expand the memory and the better Has a better camera Speeds are about the same Clarity isnt much different Stay with an s5 if you have one Switched from Straightalk to Verizon and I love it I had an Applei 5s and had tons of issues with tit I got this phone last June 0616 and it has proven to be the biggest most overpriced piece of garbage I have ever invested in  If I could give it less than 1 star I would  The battery life is a joke the camera sucks it restarts on its own I have traded this phone in for warranty replacement and it still happens the screen gets so hot you cant even hold it up to your ear to talk on the phone and Samsung corporate is even worse to deal with than a Verizon rep  Avoid at all costs I found the Galaxy S7 is perfect for everything I need in a smart phone Increased graphics great sound and awesome camera functions Purchased this phone because our old Samsung phones S3 batteries and this new phone has a lot more things that came with it Great phone and are enjoying it I bought during the holidays I absolutely love it It was really easy to set up and really easy to use It has great features on it  I just wish I had gotten my free goggles that was suppose to come with it Had galaxy s3 years agowent to htc one m8 didnt realize how much I missed the galaxys Glad to be back I bought during Thanks giving day My new phone makes me happyThe new phone gave me new life It looks like my friend It takes me too long to figure all of this out I need videos or classes to help At 70 Things take awhile sink in Kids dont have time to help Some of the preconfigured features are annoying and am surprised at the size of the icons displayed much larger then Razr Max  Overall am happy with the phone and will acclimate to the changes in functionality This is by far the best phone Ive ever used Sorry apple I think Samsung may have you beat here Minimum of 100 characters This phone is a little smaller than my s5 but it is a lot faster The battery lasts about three hours longer Im very satisfied It as worth the upgrade This phone is a great investment for the consumer If you dont like your current phone or are looking for an upgrade highly recommend buying this This phone can also support VR which is amazing It also has a great UI user interface Only had the phone a couple of weeks Seems to be more that I learn daily with this phone I was already using a galaxy s4 but wow what an awesome phone I have had this phone for about a month it is a great phone with many great features the only problem I have is one Im talking to someone else they keep telling me I soubuynd like Im in a drum no matter where I am Intown at home whatever me and my wife have the same phone and have the same problem we call Verizon and they advised us to turn off the HD features which we did but it still sounds like were talking out of a drum Easy phone able to call browse install required apps able to Uninstall bad ones currently matching iPhone 7 or slightly exceeding in few areas I got this phone a couple weeks go fter having the s5 So far I really like it It was easy for me to figure out It has a lot of new features compared to the s5  Theres a lot of features that I havent tried yet only because I havent had the chance to I bought the phone a week ago when switching to verizon I previously had the galaxy s7 active through att but verizon wouldnt service that phone I like the active better Didnt want the phone  Dont care about feature  The helper at the store didnt even try to fix my original phone  Will be returning it bc I fixed my phone by factory reset Very disappointing to have people work for you and not help people  Only worrying about commission sells is not customer service I missed out on the last few Galaxy S phones and finally got an S7 edge forgot how much I love the galaxy series Love the phone no downsides I really liked my S5 but in the short time I have used the S7 it seems worth the upgrade Enjoying the features of new phone went from an S3 to an S7 it was a leap  However its easy to figure out when you take a few minutes to focus on the new items  Great handling and screen size  Love th enew feature that doesnt allow you to go over data cap I bought the 1st one about 3 weeks ago had to send in back due to flashlight not working Took to local store they fixed worked one day That is when I mailed it make in They sent new phone so far so good Have to wait and see Ive always had the Samsung phone because of its features so was happy to upgrade to the S7 Happy with the larger screen and that it is water proof I have had a galaxy s5 and the signal strength bars on that phone were always full but on this phone I only show like 2 bars I think they must have changed the antennareception on this phone Otherwise the phone is great If anyone else has this problem please post a review So far so good great features easy to use long battery life great screen graphics it just fits well in your hand I started out with the motoZ and I loved it but it had a glitch and after many many hours of being on the phone I had no choice at the time  but to settle for the Galaxy s7 and its an ok phone but I really want the motoZ without glitches Ilovemys7edge  realy friendly to use lite weight easy to carry Im happy with the speed and the battery seems pretty good its still new so Ill have to see how it holds up Bought it for Christmas and it was easy to transfer all of my information including apps To my new cell I bought this phone a few weeks ago as an upgrade for my Samsung note 4 I have had no issues great phone I bought this phone in January and love IT The camera is wonderful and the phone is very easy to use I like android and samsung The phone meets my expectations The only thing that I dont like is the keypad I understand why the change was made but I already had a hard enough time texting with my big thumbs My fingers are just too big for the new tiny buttons and texts never come out correctly whether I use the swipe or traditional method On top of that I thought I could try using voice texting but the button that was on the S4 keypad was not carried over and up to the S7 I really frustrates me at times If you have any suggestions Id love to hear them No sure this was good choice for me  Difficult switch to new features Miss Wizard help Screen guard chosen for me is not fitting properly too slick a touch I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 which I loved and am thrilled with the S7 I have absolutely no complaints It is easy to use and the ringtones are loud enough to hear thru my bag or pocket I love all the improvements since the S3 came out which was a great phone With the Samsung Galzxy S7 Samsung finally gets some things right Samsung went back to the SD storage card use and also made the phone quite water resistant They also reworked the battery life to give longer battery life and the wireless charging feature is also available Phone has many easy to use features that I like for example bluetooth connection to my cars system messaging and phone calls made simplescreen is larger and easier to read  Addingremoving apps has been made easier  Camera is better I upgraded from the S4 to the S7 seven months ago This phone is amazing not only is it lightning fast and full of features but it is also WATER RESISTANT The camera is great and the wireless charging is a cool touch I cant imagine using anything but a Samsung Galaxy Battery life is good and I get a full day 1617 hours without recharging I am a medium use user and check my email and reply and send probably 3040 times a day Add to this the social media and internet use and the battery life is better than expected Very solid phone This is my very first smartphone and the transition from a flip phone although daunting has been smooth with the help of tech support  At first I began to believe that I was dumber then a smartphone but have adapted pretty well and really wish I would have done it sooner Went from my s5 to the s7 I love it still room for more improvements and wife got the active I think the actually buttons for back and home is better on it but no gear vroom compatability with the active Overall great phone I brought this Samsung Galaxy S7 phone two weeks ago and I love it It is easy to maneuver and operate I love the apps and my phone This phone by far surpassed my expectations  is the best phone ive owned so far I have Centurylink wifi with my old galaxy 5 soundvoice would break up where I was unintelligible now with galaxy 7 people tell me I still keep breaking up when talking  Is it the phone the wifi or WHAT I do love this phone for its ease of use especially quick connect I have had past gen Samsung galaxies and this was the smoothest transition   But it still needs a longer batter life This part downgrades a 5 star phone to only a 4 My transition from my old Galaxy is going wellThe Samsung Galaxy s7 is very sleek and adaptableTHK This is my 1st smart phone and I love it  When I havent been able to find out how to do things I either found it in settings or went online on my laptop and googled my question and was able to find my answer I had a Samsung s5 didnt think I would ever like another phone as I did that one However the s7 is just as amazing if not better I love the camera and how I can set themes to match my style Super easy to use And fast charging Bought this a little over a week ago  Still trying to learn all its featues  Trying to tune off features and apps that imy not interested in I went from the Galaxy S4 to the S7 and the transition was so easy I love the updated features and ease of navigation I absolutely love my new phone I highly recommend the galaxy 7 to anyone and everyone I had a hard time trying to decide which phone to get when I upgraded but I made the right choice I have enjoyed my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It looks good and so far works good I would recommend this phone to anyone very easy to set up love the features very fast will recommend this phone to my friends great design fits in my purse easy love it I was excited to separate from apple and their enterprise now Im regretting it S7 somehow puts apps on my phone I dont want and there are advertisements that randomly pop up I should have stuck with iPhone Its a racket but at least their products are easy to use S7 battery life is terrible as well 10 min after charging Im down 4 Ive only had the phone for 2 weeks but so far I love it I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini for almost 3 years so it was definitely time for an upgrade It was an easy transition from one phone to another and I really like the functionality of the OS The camera is terrific I use my phone to document all the family memories so a good camera is a must for me I dont see much difference between the s5 and the s7 The s5 was perfect until my 2 year contract was up and it died a month later This has happened to me twice before Curious Excellent design easy to maneuver Very satisfied customers Will recommend phone to all my friends and family members So much better then my lgG3 I love the Samsung pay feature and the lightning fast camera Cant wait to try it out with the gear VR I replaced my Galaxy S4 with the S7 only because my boyfriends phone broke and I had an upgrade available I want my S4 back This phone has less features settings and is so much harder to navigate I am really disappointed with this phone I should have gone with the Google Pixel this is a great phone camera is great speed of the phone its self is terrific a lot lighter than my previous phone sharp screen Very easy to use Overall features are bright and sound is very good quality I actually wanted the black one but they only had it in gold  turns out I really like the gold LOL  Anyway I havent finished moving everything over from my LG yet but so far its perfect  Simple to operate and syncs fine with my bluetooth headset  My only problem has been getting trying to upload music from itunes  still havent figured out how to do that  I always hate changing phones but this was a seamless process  I was able to complete the process for both my husband and myself with very little effort Thought just would never change from the iPhone to a galaxy but its the best decision I have made when picking out phones Ive been using it since just after it came out Got 2 for my daughters just recently I like the GearVR although I dont use it much like that it plays games well Big enough screen for that and movies without getting to be ridiculous
Only gripe is that I wish theyd add a speaker to the top though for stereo I transfered over this phone from another carrier Loving the compact stylish look Always reliable and easy to use I had to buy a new phone as my puppy ate my S5 funny now not so funny then  I have  been very pleased with my new phone  Operationally it is almost identical to my S5 which I liked very much  The transition went well with the exception of the transfer of my calendar some of the appointments were lost  Other than that I am very satisfied  The battery life could be a little better but I can easily get through the day on a full charge  I was disappointed that the new phone did not come with a car charger  I was informed that my S5 charger would work in so far as powering the phone but would not be able to charge it  I felt that the car charger should have come with the new phone three weeks in and love the phone except that the driving feature keeps turning itself back on after i turn it off This phone works great use it all the time My family use these items too I own over five TV that is samsung I will buy more samsung product My family berated me for not not joining the 21st Century for years  I gave in and acquired the Galaxy S7 during Christmas I am learning to use the various features and am comfortable with the basics  I definitely wish I could delete many of the builtin apps because I have absolutely no use for them  I resent having to constantly endure andor discard the urgent updates required banners and popups I am so glad that i upgraded to the s7 i did not know of all the essentials it had Very useful entertaining and effective for work and personal Went from the S5 to the S7 and am having difficulties figuring out how to maintain Internet service like I used to have Its frustrating so far I also just had 4 apps appear such as Z Camera and I have no idea why they are there now Im going through data usage really fast Im no expert and I may have things set incorrectly but its not been worth my investment yet The device is ok for my needs nothing difficult to use but nothing special either  Color selection is limited The Samsung Galaxy S7 is easy to use has the power needed to run games and apps Great phone but need to find a way to include a stylist or another format of taking notes  More options Bought this phone just the other day and was glad to do so Great choice the quality is great and is easy to understand Great Phone but wish the glass was stronger Dropped it and it broke This review was collected as part of a promotion Samsung keep surprising me with the friendly and useful features I had Galaxy S6 and now upgrade to S7 wish made me happy about all the excellent quality  fast and realability of this phone  I am a pretty loyal customer and I like to stay with what works I really loved my S5 and I assumed the S7 would be remarkable However the powers that be a t Verizon decided not to preload the Samsung appstore Very disappointing One of the things I most appreciated about the S5 was the car mode As soon as I connected my bluetooth powered it up the phone became a very usable device through my voice It was seamless In facr I could not use my phone any other way that through voice commands SO SAFE Now I have had to dl the app and it does not work the same In fact everytime I engage the app I have to manually agree to the terms Which means I have to take my eyes off of the road BAD FORM The app also seems a bit glitchy where before it was REMAARKABLE

Perhaps this is more a Samsung issue that Verizon and make no mistake I will share my opinion there too 

Thanks for listening Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife She loves the features of her new phone especially the incredible camera Great phone by samsung I couldnt be happier with it Awesome phone I just dont like that the battery dies rather quick charges up fast Awesome room I just purchased this phone over the holidays and Im glad that I did Its pretty easy to use I love the camera Phone was charged all night 6am today battery life was at 100 its 747am and Im down to 80 Just traded my Pixel XL for the Galaxy s7 so far battery life is non compatible Missingmy pixel XLAlready  Great phone I wish I had bought it soonerIt has a great camera and the sound is louder which I like Very easy to use After you get all the unwanted baggage out of the way andor off the phone then its a good deal  Youd think theyd ask you what you want on there instead of pushing a bunch of needless advertising down your throat I bought this phone less than a month ago and the screen saver is coming a part already and I have never dropped it or abused it in any way why is that Some changes from S6 that are not as convenient such as scheduling a text but mostly easy and fun I love the storage capabilities on this phone as well as the camera There are also numerous other great features however I have been greatly disappointed in the Bluetooth connectivity with my car It will connect but takes a lot longer than my last phone but will just randomly disconnect It has happened between calls and during calls It has occurred in low service areas as well as high service areas It also happens even if my car isnt moving If not for this I would have given it an overall 5 stars Excellent phone Apps and Web pages open up fast Battery life is OK for my medium use My only wish is that the s7 was equipped with a stereo speakers like that of iPhone 7 which is amazing This was my 2 year upgrade   I had the Galaxy S5 previously and loved it  I love the Galaxy S7 even more  The sound is clearer my photos are sharper and best of all the screen is larger This is my second smartphone and I was dreading getting a new one because of the difficulty I had getting used to the first one This one took a while 12 weeks for me to customize it but it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it and get used to it   The battery is great its extremely easy to get to the common settings such as turning datawifibluetooth on and off there are lots of options for customization and mostly things are easy to do  The only thing I miss is a normal telephone ringtone that is fairly loud but so far what Ive chosen is working out Ive had it a few weeks now and it has been an easy transition from the Motorola I did have a S3 before the Motorola and Im sure that helped also So glad I changed Got this phone as my up grade and Im glad I did Still learning how to do everything on the phone but once I do I know it will be everything I want The good fast excellent display water resistant excellent camera large ext storage headphone jack battery life wireless charging split screen on some apps Got an excellent text app and keyboard app Nice large keyboard Split screen texting and youtube
The bad slippery phone afraid to drop push wrong buttons easily and hard too hold I will get a plastic case to help Had to use my copy app on both phones to get contacts copied the default app did not work for me Speaker is okay not the best
Overall the best phone on the market for me The right size for me This Samsung S7 phone replaced another brand of phone that had extremely poor battery performance The Samsung phone gives me 23 days of service on a single charge even with heavy call usage emails and social media Thank you I just bought this phone about a week ago and am very pleased with it Very easy to use and a nice size Its a great phoneBUT Samsung wont support it with Monthly security updates or Beta accessall this model are on Sept 1 updatesIf you are thinking about buying this unlocked phone DONT ITS A SECURITY RISK I love the galaxy phones they are all I ever get just wish that the home button didnt stick so often It was an easy switch from my last phone also a Samsung will good features and battery life It is a little overloaded with bloat ware so you might spend some time disabling or removing applications Bought this phone for my wife she had a S4 and pretty much wanted to throw it out the window Now she is a happy wife again Like they say A happy wife happy life I bought my phone a couple weeks ago and changed from an iPhone to this phone for the camera which is anything but great Might have to take it back Its a lemon I am very impressed with the quality of this phone Crystal clear and extremely detailed screen sleek and sexy design of the phone and easy to use buttons and touchscreen Samsung puts out in my opinion the best in tech This s quality that you know will last a while Additionaly the phone works super fast  This phone loads up apps and wbesites faster than my laptop even when im using data and not just my wifi And the Always On Display is really convienant 1010 will continue to buy samsung devices Very impressed The phone is very similar to the G5 which I liked a lot  But I am really missing the infared blaster  I totally expected to be able to use this phone as a TV remote as I did with the old one  Why in the world would Samsung take that away  Other than that no issues Ive been using this phone for about 4 months now and its performed flawlessly  Its a good size and overall feel and real quick on apps loads  The last samsung phone I had was the Note 2 and honestly I wish the note 7 wasnt flawed and no longer but I look forward to note 8 anyway it was a great phone as well and I like this one just as much I bought this a couple weeks ago and I am still learning the features of this phone  Had never had a smart phone before so is quite a learning lesson for me  Do like the apps I can use  Hope to learn much more about it in the next few months I bought this 3 months ago even though I wanted a note 7 oh well  The battery drains fast even though I keep it on power save  I thought a smaller phone might be more convenient but I miss the bigger phone
On the good side this phone takes the best pictures Ive ever seen on a cell phone  The camera is easy to use also  Videos are also good quality  I hope the Note 8s come out soon This phone is the most expensive and most breakable phone i have ever had I should be able use a phone normally without it breaking but that is not possible with this phone Within 1 month of owning this phone i dropped it from my hand onto the hardwood floor in my house and the screen broke had a screen protector on it Then yesterday i dropped it on my driveway when getting out of the car and shattered the rear of the phone which for some reason is made of glass If you going to buy this phone i recommend you purchase a screen protector and the best phone case possible either that or cover it in bubble wrap because this the most fragile phone i have ever seen As far as the performance of the phone goes it is great but i will never  spend another dime on a Samsung phone until they can figure out how to build a phone that can withstand daily life without me having to spend hundreds of dollars additional for a screen protector and phone cover which completely negates the slimness of this phone Not impressed at all Had only a week but love so far except lost all contacts Dropped in Creek yesterday and it didnt phase it I hadnt even received my case yet thats pretty amazing Love it This phone has repaired my broken heartI was heartbroken when I had to return my Note 7 due to the recall but this phone has definitely mended it all back for me with SAMSUNG I have a household full of SAMSUNG products and have had some of them for many years and I will continue to be a SAMSUNG customer because they make very awesome products Im looking forward to the next NOTE series because the only thing I miss is the SPen I have had a few Samsung phones but they always needed one more thing to be what I really wanted I didnt even try the Samsung S6 because it had no sd card slot The S7 seems to have everything I want an sd card slot water resistance without the stupid door fast charging 32 GB of memory and good performance I traded this in for my S4 a few weeks ago Its easy to use like the S4 but Im a bit overwhelmed still Lots to learn The messaging keyword is a little tricky only in so far as the autocorrect seems very sensitive and not as clean at using an emoji keyboard Overall I love it Chose the S7 because wireless charging built in and micro SD slot  Very good speed and bright screen  Problem is Googles Android no apps will sync contacts with PC unless using MS Exchange calendar and email works fine  I read where Google contentious history with Microsoft is the problem I miss my Windows 10 phone OS but like the S7s horse power  Lots of apps but most not much goodbuggy or for kids Screen and camera are great quality 5 stars use as a phone is two stars or less I barely get a couple bars of service in my own centrally located house and calls could hollow echoy and terrible hard to make out whats being said at times Luckily I dont use my phone much as a phone so this only deducted one star for me 
Battery life is just ok nowhere near as good as the phone claims to be but the always on screen function and junky apps seem to contribute to that and can be cleaned up 

The standard apps that come on this phone for text messaging etc are TERRIBLE compared to my old HTC  so it took a bit of deleting and downloading to get things working to my satisfaction but that just may be how it goes these days Quite a bit of junk apps to ditch and settings to switch up and the layout and organization feels counterintuitive to me and difficult to navigate but the camera is SO good I still forgive it at 4 stars Using Verizon cloud everything was easy to set up and use Within a half an hour of turning the phone on everything was transferred pictures contacts I bought the product on December 26 2016 and I love it  I am especially pleased with the strong signal I bought it last month it works really good the plan is chose is awesome I also got my husband one as well I really enjoy my new phone I got it as a Christmas gift right after Christmas and I really love it It is really easy to use and it was an easy transition from my S5 I like how light and sleek it is compared to my old phone Im glad I bought it Nice phone a lot of kool features While I like the features I hate the size Why no small Phones  I have small hands Unfortunately needed new phone because battery was bad in  old one Absolutely love this phone Great camera Would definitely recommend this phone to others She loves the widgets and games greaT PHONE EASY TO USE I recently bought this phone and its amazing The screen is big and I am able to watch all my shows on my phone Also I have lots of storage space to download all sorts of apps I was using a Galaxy Note 3 that was functioning but only at about 70 battery not holding charge screen cracked apps not responsive sometimes But now that I have crossed over I couldnt be happier  The new S7 has a smaller screen but with the improved resolution you wouldnt know It is bright quick and had a minimal learning curve for me coming from the Note 3 We have extremely poor signal at home but the Verizon folks were able to assist with activation by pushing to me so I didnt need to leave home Transition was smooth to keep old number Ok Works quite well Same as s5 Shouldve been able to bring phone Dont think I get what I pay for This phone has been giving me trouble It flashes often as if its going to go out on me Very intuitive Does most everything I can think of A replaceable battery woudl make it perfect I received the Samsung Galaxy S7 for Christmas and Ive never used a smartphone before  It is so easy to learn this phone and to use the features I was afraid of the new technology but am no longerI love it The way that the phone functions is easy for me to use I am not tech savvy
The camera is really good compared to my previous Galaxy S5 and easier to use 
Does occasionally get really warm just being in my purse this is random Opted to spend the extra money to get the latest phone rather than paying less for an earlier generation Im happy I did I love this phone The call quality is great Im on Verizon the pictures are great battery last a long time and charges quickly Enjoy using Samsung Pay and have only run into a couple of places where it had issues working otherwise it is simple and quick to use it is nice not having to pull my wallet out all the time On top of all that processor speed is quick and it fits nicely in my hand Highly recommend great upgrade from Samsung galaxy s5 This is my first smartphone and I was pleased to see how easy it was to set up So much to learn but enjoying it very much I recently upgraded 2 phones on my plan from a Samsung 3 to Samsung 7 models With the new models I am not able to make or be heard on calls that come to my new cell phone when at my home I did not have this issue with my Samsung 3 The store associates tried to help and I even called the Verizon 800 and that still doesnt make it work like my old phone did I use my cell as my work so this is very a bad experience I am having with Verizon I just want to make receive and be heard when using my cell At this point I can test and play game apps at thats about it I am very disappointed and will look for better service i had a basic phone my sin saud time for the twenty first century so i have the phone the phone bought for our son way better thane the i phone 6 series love  the Samsung Galaxy 7 I got this phone on Christmas break and I am enjoying the videos and camera  The picture is so crisp and clear great phone still learning all it can do I upgraded from Motorola turbo and this phone works much betterfaster and easier The battery life could be better but the fat fast charge works great Great phone Smooth transition Like the placement of onoff button Altho lost the autoreject feature on phone screen which was quick and easy Long battery life Easy to function Great camera My husband got me this phone for Christmas and I am so pleased with it Camera is super clear and takes crisp pictures Only had phone for about a week Great great great great Absolutely  love it My first smartphone Easy to use No difficulty with any of the apps I have only had an android and have enjoyed using it versus the other type of phone  I like the fingerprint security feature for accessing the phone plus the upgrade of the calendar and clock  The camera seems to be improved also I wouldve liked to see a note size screen but its love still Nice phone functionally good but still getting familiar with it since weve only had it a week  Big performance hit  battery charge This is the third s7 I have  purchased for my family Awesome phone The new S7 is the best pictures and features could not be better I have had my S7 for about 2 weeks and I think it just builds on the S4 that I had  The camera is outstanding and the phone is so easy to use I love the camera clarity The whole phone is very similar to the S4 I traded in I like that it is water resistant I upgraded about 2 weeks ago after having the S4 for about 2 years and this phone is such an improvement  It audio and video improvement is apparent immediately  It provides shortcuts that were not there before Great phone  user friendly bought it 1 week ago  So far so good only downside is the nonremovable battery Too frustrated with LG so went back to samsung greats phone awesome screen water resistant and good battery Got the phone last week and i love it Verizon is the best the numbers on the  galaxy 5 were too close to the sides causing the mistakes when I typed 1 4 and 7  this has been corrected   My galaxy 5 did not ring loud enough  this phone can ring much louder  internet wifi speed is slower than my sons year old IPhone but 1 second per search makes me little difference Title says it all I am not going to take the time to write more Just had it a few daysSo lam still getting used to itIt get better every min It was a good deal but miss SIRI Facetime Photo Stream and all of my specific software   Had to buy new Apps for a different type of phone Got this phone on Christmas special other wise I would not of switched Had a flip phone Now that I have I am enjoying the features of it and all the new posibilities that can be in store with it Phone is okayhavent really found anything that bothers me Easy to use and functional Putting the removable memory back in and adding water resistance were the two most important things the S6 lacked The S7 is much better than the excellent S6 I been with Samsung phones for 3 yearsand will continue I am content and it works fine My last phone was from a different era so I am really appreciating the improved photography the much longer battery life and fast charging ability  The capability of this phone is unbelievable  I dont think this phone is preloaded with as many useless apps as my last phone I had the S5 and I was pretty happy with it  The battery life just got old and I was starting to have problems charging  The S7 is nice but not much different than what I had  So Im happy that its consistently good but not blown away by any new features  Thumbs up I bought the phone a little over a week ago and the screen has already shattered The phone had a case and took a small impact to the back corner which caused the face to crack The forward camera has been rendered unusable due to the cracks over it 

The phone is not as durable as it should be for s device that people handle so regularly The requirement for screen protectors and protective cases is absurde My previous phone was a note 4 and survived far worse without any issue beside scuff marks on the edges I got this phone for my wife and she loves it A definite improvement over the Galaxy S6 So are so good Gets very hot very fast So glad I waited and upgraded to the S7 Great phone and Verizon had some great holiday promotions I really like the quick access to the camera  comes up and snaps a pic SO quick  fabulous My battery  does not last long  I have to charge my phone every afternoon even when I have not been on my phone all day It is not any better than my old phone that is 2 years old Overall very good  Still figuring out some big differences from my S5 like why space bar label shows as English instead of space but much better battery life and speed etc outweigh that I upgraded from the S5 and I am sure there are still upgrades in the phone that I dont know about  Love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Ive only had my phone a little over a week but so far Ive glad I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to a Galaxy S7 Lost a lot of our contacts after we purchased the the new phones Like this phone but for what it costs and what the service costs I shouldnt have to put up with all the ads that I have no interest in The S7 takes beautiful pictures  Not happy with battery life  that so many apps run in background  Should be able to turn more things off  they should only come on when you use them  Miss some features of my old LG G2 like the double tap on  the power button on back Battery doesnt last and still not a fan of not being able to remove the battery Battery life is horrible Being able to use a micro as card again is awesome and it is a beautiful phone with awesome resolution and gorgeous pictures Very happy with the phone Just bought this and am loving all of the new features Purchased only 1 week ago Upgraded from the S3so the S7 is awesome My only complaint is texting I do a lot of itand Im always fixing letters or spacing or spell checking words I didnt write This is probably true on other phonesbut I wish the texting technology was better I bought this phone approx   1 month ago I am very happy with the upgrades to my Galaxy S5 I have had the phone a couple of weeks now and I am very satisfied with it I love the S7  The battery life is long I love the video call function  The picture and sound are great Very easy to maneuver through the phone Love all the memory space The phone itself is great however the registration and support features seem to be intentionally difficult While I doubt this is the case the whole process needs to be streamlined This review was collected as part of a promotion Ive never had an iPhone so I was thrilled to upgrage my Samsung GS5 to this GS7 Worked great for about 3 months then the problems began The 64 GB memory card that came with it became corrupt and and I lost all my photos videos and music Replaced it with another one and same thing happened a short while later The back camera glass has now broken 3 times without me dropping the phone The last time it was in my sweat pants pocket for five minutes while I was sitting on the couch Pulled it out and broken glass I cannot fathom how this happened as I hadnt moved So Ive replace the back camera glass 3 times and the camera itself 2 times Some apps crash randomly battery life is poor and getting worse phone feels very hot to the touch occasionally etc With a year and 3 months left on this contract I am considering making the switch already to something more reliable I absolutely love this phone Its another great product from samsung I bought this phone and although the features are very nice calls are very unclear 75 of the time and sounds for texts no longer work I exchanged it once already so plan to request a different model It is very accessible Light weight The applications and speed of this product are better than what I expected My previous phone was a Note Edge and I thought the adjustment period was going to be longer To my surprise and only took me one day The dimensions on this product are appropriate for manhandling Phone is pretty good Gets very hot at times battery life isnt great I really wish it would just not over heat so fast  Especially when using the VR it takes like 20 minutes and then its too hot  Sometimes when watching Netflix it gets hot as well  But overall everything else is awesome  Could be slightly bigger Was looking to upgrade my wifes Moto G to something with more memory 32GB and a large screen She loves it As for me Im an apple guy Very reliable and efficient smart phone Only negative thing I have to say is that I am not able to download a particular APP that I was able to on my LG phone Faster easy to add more memory no bugs so far better battery life better memory management than my S6 So far Im a happy camper This phone is very great It has a lot of features that are not gimmicky they are very useful Phone is greatfeatures easy to use I had a note 4 and wanted a note 7 settled for the S7 Another excellent phone from Samsung Very refined and smooth I have a Galaxy S4 and it was time for an upgrade to the Galaxy S7 and I love it Not happy with phone at allnot what I expected Samsung has another great phone this is my 3rd updated in 7yrs Does everything I need it to do for work and personal use The only problem is the back cover is too flimsy and cracked a week after I had got it and 1 day before my case for it arrived So upset Fell out of leg pocket when bending down and less than a foot off the ground and the whole back plate cracked likeep auto glass Disappointed Nothing to add yet have only had it 2 weeks Nice step up from the Galaxy S4 Mini that I had for three years  Ive had the S7 for two weeks now and the main issue is how people sound when using HD Voice activated to when HD Voice is disabled FYI I dont use HD Video Calls  With HD Voice on the people Im talking to either sound like they are talking to you from under a blanket or in a closet or their is a strange echo as other sounds are disproportionately being picked up  Voice calls sound better and more natural with HD Voice turned off  BUT if you do that you cannot simultaneously be on a call and use any app that needs data access  It didnt used to be this way  But now that technology is evolving so phone only have and only use one type of antenna 4GLTE and not multiple antennas you cannot use data while on a phone call if HD Voice is disabled  So I suffer through the lower quality voice with HD calling on so I can use data to conduct work while out on my appointments  As soon as I dont need to use both at the same time I disable HD voice so my calls are clearer and sound more natural  Maybe in time the HD Voice technology will improve and the calls through that software will sound as natural and good as when not using HD Voice  Otherwise it is a nice step up in performance over my previous phone Upgrade to my S6 So far so good Battery life greatly improved I am thankful for the great package Verizon provided for us as we wanted to purchase 2 smartphones  It is early in our relationship to the S7s since we just purchased them last week but all indications are that they will serve us well I upgraded from the S4 and absolutely love the new phone Bright clear display and lots of great features Get this phone Not really any better or worse than what I had before I bought this phone a few weeks ago and am thoroughly pleased with it  It took the previous apps and features and made them that much better Had it a couple weeks  Its different from the Galaxy S3 it replaced  Didnt get all files  apps copied from the old one Still trying to find out how to get the rest on the new phone  Lost a lot of old AOL messages that didnt come over from the old phone  Some apps etc confusing to use in comparison to the s3 Like the old message app a lot more than the new one included in the phone  Too limited and or confusing  Was happier once the old one was found and put to use Need time to get used to new phone  Would be able to make a better evaluation later I really like Samsung devices especially the Galaxy series Phone cuts off on its own and it locks up Had only several weeks but so far great Easy transition using Verizon store at Darlington SC Screen is brighter and easier to see without reading glasses  Sound quality is better  Great for me as my older eyes and ears like it Ive only had it a few days but I love it  The screen has great resolution and the phone is easy to use This phone is as great as any iPhone Screen is big and good quality Picks up weak cell towers better than any phone I live in Mountainous area and signal get weak in some areas but I have one when most others do not bought it 3 months ago and wish i had my s5 back I purchased this phone for my daughter  She is very happy with her new phone and its capabilities My Galaxy s3 died a noble death after years of faithful service I knew my next phone would be samsung galaxy s7 It is perfection Exactly what I wanted Not too much Perfect size Simply the greatest phone Ive ever had I got it a week ago and love it I would recommend it to anybody looking for a great phone I really that that it is waterproof also because Im outside a lot it helps to not have to worry about my phone getting wet Phone works as expected and some Easy to use fast processor and Samsung VR is great with it Bought phone a week ago and I am so happy I went from 4 to 7 Galaxy phone Dont like the phone Upgraded from Galaxy 5 was an easy transition Just a few minor things to get used to as in typing styles and improving to messager Battery life is much improved My battery gets extremely hot Purchased this phone as a replacement for a Droid Mini Hands down better than the Motorola in all areas Love the phone  Easy to use I got this phone just a week ago I like it Only had it a week but so far so good The phone is awesome and has an awesome camera very easy to work My new phone lasted about 5 days before it failed Ive had this phone for about a week and had a problem losing the network Ive taken it in twice and they replaced the sim card the first time and the 2nd time did a soft reset So far its working fine Extremely excited to get a upgrade on phone and save money Great phone easy to use for my motherinlaw and easy for me to help remotely Screen Display is vivd high resolution Camera is the best ever Have owned the Galaxy 3 5 and 6
32 GB of RAM is plenty Speed of apps is also better This review was collected as part of a promotion I was overdue for an upgrade and change in service Enjoy this phone a lot I bought this cell a few months ago as an upgrade from the Galaxy 5  I thought the there will not much of a change in features but I was wrong  I especially enjoy Samsung pay  The only thing I dont like is that you cant remove the battery  I had an issue with the battery with the S5 I had to recharge it a few times during the day  I bought a new battery for it and the cell was fine  Overall this cell is great for my needs This phone is so much faster and easier to use than the iphone So long itunes The hardware and software is all fine and dandy comparable to every other high end smart phone out there  I hate holding this phone though  First off it is terribly slippery especially coming from a droid turbo  Second the positioning of the buttons and speaker does not seem to be thought out very well  The power button should be more towards the top of the phone and I find myself unintentionally covering the speaker quite often Just bought it a little over a week ago and the battery runs down fast  Also it takes forever to charge I recently upgraded to my first smartphone from my old flip phone I knowwelcome to the 21st Century I like all the features the new phone has and can see why everyone is hooked on their phones I fought the urge to upgrade as long as I could but gave in when I discovered that it was actually cheaper to upgrade I have had this phone for a couple of weeks and it is so much better than my old one Easy to navigate super fast lots of storage I find this phone not only difficult to read but difficult to hit the right lettersnumbers when searching for something or texting Where I can make the text bigger does help but not everything on the page transfers to larger type An example on the contact list I can make the names bigger but not the alphabet letters running along the side where I need to choose another letter  Also there are too many ads on the phone is OK but the speed when on wifi is very slow  Also experienced difficulty in downloading music from my laotp to my new S I have had my phone for about 3 weeks now  I had a S5 before this one  The S7 is easy to use  I love the 32GB of storage  It holds a charge for about 24 hours no matter how much I use it  I am glad I decided to stick with Samsung and go with the S7  It loads up fast and it is fast moving from screen to screen I like my new phone because it is very similar to my last Samsung One big similarity they have is that the battery life on the new phone runs down every bit as fast as the other Samsung phone It wonthe last a full day without being recharged Other than that it is a great phone a day easy to use I upgraded to the S7 when my S5 failed  it had probably been dropped one too many times The upgrade was very easy The S7 is a really fine phone screen resolution is superb camera is super fast charge is wonderful Not much different from the galaxy 5 saddened no user manual was with phone  have had to have family help with how to answer the phone to how to  text to how to set up voice mail sad I just bought it and really like it so far Have had no trouble using the phone We bought 3 s 7 phones and 1 s j 3 v for Christmas and the s j 3 v beats the s7 phones on battery life  I had a Casio  g one and it was built lIke a tank  It wasnt fast but it was unbreakable  Also waterproof and even with continues use it would last a few days   Not this s7  I tried on day one to use this phone as much as I had the g one Pandora email couple phone calls  By 9 am battery was showing connect charger   That night I turned it off charged it again I found a battery setting to conserve battery and I still has to use restraint on how I used it  Simply setting ring tones background etc drained it   So I tried to second battery conservation setting this actually helped make it through the day but here is my argument if I have to disable so many features that are on this phonejust to make it through the day as a phone I could have saved my money and gotten a flip phone   By the time you disable  data WiFi Bluetooth email etc all you have is a super expansive super fragile phone   I will say this I like this phone the features are awesome  but I cant use them unless Im at home cause I dont have a car charger and this thing drinks batteries like a hummer drinks  gas  This thing is awesome with the head gear from oculus the vr gear is cool  Just make sure you are on WiFi or you will go through 2 gigs of data in about 5 minutes we learned the hard way   Also this phone is really hot to the touch while using this  head  gear   Another thing about the oculus is every gamevideo etc  that you do saves to your phones storage    I Havent mentioned much about the  fragility of this but coming from a g  zone that I could throw up in the air and it still was perfect when I picked it up going to this  Samsung s 7 is difficult  Im a heavy user  Im in sales I need my email etc if I need my Casio I can use it knowing it week will l be there at the end of the day  Ive dropped it on concrete floors more than I can count   This new phone has me so scared to drop it I cant or wont put it in my pocket cause its so fragile   So I leave it in the car   Kind of useless honestly    I have big issues with all smartphone makers today  If you can make a Casio g zone that I can beat up for 6 yrs and it functions perfectly why can you not do it now  I want a phone Im not scared to use and dont say you need a case  I should not have to buy a case that costs half the price of this stupid phone   If the phone is that fragile the case should have come with it  I would much rather had a good case than  the 9900 vr head gear   My problem isnt with Samsung its with Verizon please start offering more rugged phones  The  technology is their Hello Casio  This is a great phone if you dont mind being plugged in to use it  Software so far  is cool but the battery is a big negative in my opinion I bought this phone 8 days ago and already have to get a new one Not helpful at all when theres a problem  Too expensive Had it about 1 week happy I bought this one Work great as long as its not in my Otterbox case with screen protection then screen sensitivity is way to low to read my finger and no way to increase sensitivity which sucks cause you have to have this in a case its not very durable Powerful  fast The S7 was a good choice This is a awesome phone great features I used a S5 for 2 years and it was rock solid The S7 appears to be equally well built with faster responses and a significatly better camera especially in low light conditions It also is better at closeup photography It is OK not great would like a better phone Love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 The battery lasts longer and it feels less bulky in my hand I love the camera resolutions on my S7 The only thing Im not sure why my emails wouldnt accept images automatically from trusted senders It also doesnt display emails by block of Dates  instead it just stack up I see no differences between the 4 and the 7 other than some things are even harder to get to work I love my new phone and all the features Taken a while to get used to the differences from old phone but the transition has not been difficult Happy I made the change This phone is sleek and light weight with an awesome camera Make sure you get a case the back of the phone is glass and and will break Plugs right in with your Gmail account to restore all apps picture and settings This is my 3rd Galaxy  I had the S3 S5 and now the S7 which I hesitant to purchase because of my experience with the first 2  Now after only 3 short months my S7 is stalling the battery is literally disappearing quickly

In search for a new phone by a new company My new Samsung galaxy s7 edge is wonderful product Its thin and comes with a large screen and lots of memory space My new phone not only looks beautiful it works great The transition was a breeze  using the adapter that came with the phone I easily transferred data and apps from my old phone It take amazing pictures So clear and sharp The S7 goes far beyond my expectations It is a great phone it does everything I expected it is stylish and has much more speed than my previous phone I would recommend it to a friend and others Great phone I loved my note 4 would still prefer a note but this phone is amazing I didnt care these until I started using it Love it now Fast many options Best phone Ive ever had The only reason I can say its the best because I did like my note better but it was outdated and not as evolved Id still prefer my note 4 if its performance wasnt outdated Absolutely love this phone amazing camera great battery life tons of great galaxy apps Best phone on the market right now Great features and easy to use Love the Galaxy S7 design Two weeks on the phone is troublefree has lived up to all my expectations The only issue I have found so far is no IR blaster you cannot use it for a remote control kind of a bummer that Samsung would leave this simple feature out Its okay I upgraded because my S3 wouldnt hold a charge for longer than 8 hours or so and thats with a new battery

It doesnt seem that much better than the S3 although the batter charges much faster and holds longer Im not impresses with anything else really though the OS upgrades are annoying Things work close to but not quite the same way  and with no noticeable improvement Sometimes I think they make change just so you have something new to download but with little to no real improvement

Dont upgrade unless you have to or unless its a amazing deal Ive only had this phone for a few days but I absolutely love it already Its much faster than my previous phone Samsung Note Edge and I dont have to constantly charge this phone after playing a quick game on my work breaks Have had a week and it seems to be missing features I enjoyrd on my old phone Still excellent all around I was hate my S6 Edge that Edge was horrable I decided to get a different phone any phone well any Galaxy phone and all I had to choose from was the S7 or the S7 since I will NEVER buy an Edge again  Well I was worried since I didnt get much to choose from but this phone is the BEST  The batter is beyond my dreams for starters and it has no edge so I can buy a case for it that WORKS and I dont drop it or push stuff I dont indent to  I also can put a Micro SD in it WHY wasnt that possible with the edge I dont know Have only had this phone a few weeksso far very happy My wife loves this phone The best camera she has ever had So easy to operate and so fast Ive had the S7 about a week already back to Verizon twice first first activation then for a simcard issue  I couldnt send any pictures and could not respond to group messages Verizon needs to do a better initial quality check
Positives are longer battery life bigger battery speaker phone quality is excellent and pictures are great
Transitioning from the old S4 to the S7 has not been easy Deleting messages seemed easier on the S4 for an example Great product   Upgrade from S6  Love it I am much happier with the S7 than the edge because with the edge I was unable to make the a screen protector stick properly on the edge and it was frustrating Bought this last week to replace older Samsung  So far its been pretty easy to adapt to I had my Note 4 stolen and I received the Samsung 7 and although it is not the same size as my Note 4 I do like the S7 Very intuitive and easy to use right out of the box Glad I got it After using my Galaxy S3 for several years getting an upgrade to the Galaxy 7 is terrific After owning it for one week I am still discovering features to try out The picture quality is just beautiful I have only had it 10 days and I am pretty bad with tech stuff but it was fairly easy to change from my last phone The new Samsung Galaxy s7 has a beautiful screen and as a quilter I am in love with the high quality of the camera as well as its extreme facility in taking photos The phone as excellent speed and moves with power through all its functions The icons are so easy to read and the set up is perfect for logical people as well as those who want to breeze through the phone I am super impressed by the Samsung representatives at our local kiosk as they treat you with respect are highly trained and patient with questions They also provide training classes so you do not have to suffer through the laborious lines and impossible websites of other providers I highly recommend anyone struggling with a phone or who demands high quality to try the Galaxy S7 I purchased the Galaxy S7 to replace my Galaxy S4 just over a week ago  Holding a charge longer is what I have noticed the most I have it for just a week love the speed ait is easy to use Best smart phone yet ive had it for a week  The edges are so sensative and i dont have 
The Edge  Maybe when I get a cover for my phone it wont do that easy to handleand to work whit then Good quality and fast speed  Screen is smaller than my LG phone Galaxy S7 is huge improvement No built in apps to clean junk ram etc  I have gotten error messages telling me my battery is unprotected that my memory is full and my ram has viruses  All want me to download an app to fix the problem  This happens every time I turn my phone on  VERY ANNOYING I love the new Samsung S7 I originally ordered the iPhone 7 and hated it  Got this and love it This is a great phone except for the locked apps and browser bookmarks This is the first branded phone I ever bought All the others in the past I bought unlocked and had none of the carrier junk Bottom line this phone will be rooted since Verizon seems to think we are all children Verizon you should stop the crapapps we cant remove and allow your customers to use their phone as seen fit Otherwise your phones will get the root I upgraded from an S4 so this is just fantastic  The quality of pictures is unbelievable  I really like the phone The phone its self is pretty solid well built and so far reliable I dropped my phone inside an otter box defender case from a 12 roof into water about 4 deep I didnt realize it had fallen out of my nail bags but when I found the phone it still functioned fine I attribute the crash protection of the case to the drop protection but the phone its self did not allow water to enter as advertised

The new version of Android is easier to use in some ways but some features are a little harder to find Such as stopping the download manager and the developer features But this is partly learning curve for the newest android version Texting over a wifi network is also a great benefit for me Overall the phone and the Android OS are working well with no issues I remain solidly convinced that Samsung makes one of the best phones on the market at the moment

1 Battery life under heavy use with wifi and Bluetooth on is about 14 hours I have stretched that to 4 days without charging if I turn on the power saving features in the settings drop down
2 Call quality is outstanding and easy to hear and understand even on speaker 
3 Charging time is rather short about an 45 minutes hour from 1 to 100 even when all features wifi bluetooth are still on 
4 Camera functions well taking great photos in all conditions so far The magnify feature is also VERY useful for me and shows an extremely clear close up view of anything that is more than 5 inches from the camera
5 The Google play app for music is a little hard to navigate but I dont listen to much music on my phone However the music from the phone is very cleanclear and loud enough to be heard clearly over normal talking and chatter I love the way it fits in my hand It is uick and the picture is clear sharp and the colors are wonderful What a super phoneIt has so may features I havent found them all The phone has a much better antenna than my Galaxy S4 so I can make calls now from everywhere in my threestory home With the exception of a few setup mysteries this phone has done far better than I had expected  Check back with me in about a year and Ill know better what to watch out for I  brought this about a week ago and love This phone has a better picture My other phone died on me so I had to get a new phone  I Love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Could use a raising class as it is different than my LG Very happy overall with my new Galaxy S7  Had a S4 for three years  Will miss the ability to switch out batteries Only had this for one week so far though I like it Yet got a week ago its great I  brought   this  phone   for   a  Xmas   gift  for  my  granddaughter I love this phone I like my new phone I love this new phone I thought a smaller phone would be ok but Im having a hard time adjusting to the difference The exterior is so smooth it slips out of my hand constantly  I text with both hands and my left hand invariably hits the wrong keys now Excruciatingly slow to load pages and weak wifi retrieval  And lastly syncing the info between phones was more difficult than Id experienced in the past  This is the first time Ive wanted to return a phone Now that the year is coming to an end and the price has come down a little you couldnt ask for more value from a phone By no means does that mean its dated The S7 still remains the top phone on the market

 The first thing you notice upon turning the S7 on is the screen The crisp HD amoled screen with its curved edges is nothing short of stunning I like having the option out of box to change the icon display size as well With 4GBs of RAM running Marshmallow on an Octacore processor you can be sure any video website or photos you throw at it respond snappy without any of the stutters or lag you experience with lower quality phones 

Samsung Switch makes getting a new phone easier than ever Simply connect your old device to the S7 with the provided USB connector and easily transfer everything from contacts music and photos to documents and WiFi information from your old device to your new one effortlessly Add in features like Samsung Pay Wireless Charging NFC and Smart View along with the Fingerprint and Iris Scanner not to mention the 16MP Low Light back camera with flashwhats not to love 

The only thing I find myself missing is the IRBLASTER and the SPen found in the Note Series I bought this when my contract expired Extra 4GB data free Loved my Samsung Galaxy 5 Somewhat hard to learn to use for a beginner I had to download 195 pages of user manual to really get started Im still learning the features on this phone Finding that my Motorola phone had a few better options on it than this one though 
Store employees should take the time to show every option on phone and how they work
I probably have more options on this phone that I would use if I were shown So far Ive had no problems whatsoever with my galaxy s7 I love the privacy and security settings that come equipped and the great customer service provided by Samsung The only thing you need to worry about with this phone is fingerprints Ive got a bit of OCPD when it comes to fingerprints and am having to get a case to keep myself from looking at them Purchased 2 weeks ago and having issues Upgraded to Samsung 7 love this phone Camera rocks The phone is a step up from the previous phones Very fast and light Great screen resolution and camera Could use stero speakers to be perfect Bought it for my husband and he loves it and all the features Going from an iPhone 6 plus to an android based phone was quite the challenge Still not sure this is right for me but will have to carry on until end of contract This phone is average with what I have had in the past only had it a week and so far love it totally familiar android system is easy to operate and set up a piece of cake Ive had the phone for about a week the phone itself is nice however the battery length sucks and the phone doesnt stay charged Having had an S4 and S6 both of which worked well I expected good things from the S7  Battery life is much improved and the new camera does some very nice tricks as well as taking very good photos Its also the best sounding phone as a phone Ive had in a long time clear voice quality no dropouts I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 and am an old guy that doesnt except change well  However small things like the quality of voice service is much better in regards to filtering out wind and clarity is supreme  The camera is superb in terms of exceptional pictures great color and excellent resolution  
On the down side change does not come easy opening with a fingerprint is an excellent addition but changing screens and arriving at the desired phone destination is somewhat difficult for me but I am still in the learning curve  Ask me in six months and I may be really happy or ready to throw the phone under a bus who knows I purchased this phone two weeks ago and I am glad I choise the S7 I bought this phone a few weeks ago transition from my Galaxy s5 was not to bad has a much better camera on this phone still getting used to some of the features this phone was supposed to have a super battery and fast charging  I don t use it heavily and the battery does not last 8 hrs it does come on faster thans the 4  You have my email incorrect in the system was very unhappy with the rep that assited me I upgraded from a Galaxy 3 to this phone  I am still learning about all the new and updated features on this phone  The phone is fast  It is also a lighter weight than my previous phone  The transition from my old phone was very easy I purchased my new phone a few weeks ago and like it much better than my previous phone S4 mini with the exception  that I am unable to use my Peel remote any longer that was a convince I am disappointed to lose Bought the phone a few weeks ago  Very happy I did Beautiful phone and easy to use I love Samsung devices I moved from iphone 5c and have been very happy with this phone  The screen is great and got some very good Christmas photos of the family Fragile though Dropped my first one and it didnt hit the concrete very hard but cracked the screen and LCD  Fortunately I got a good deal on another Very much like my S6same size I just got this cell last week  I absolutely love it Im not one to change cell phones often but when I saw this deal I just couldnt pass it up I had a note3 which was also a reliable phone the only drawback for me is the note was bulky  heavy I think I made the right choice with the galaxy7 I upgraded to the S7 two weeks ago replacing a Samsung Core Prime It is slightly larger has a much sharper display has much better battery life is much faster and has a lot more useful Bells  Whistles Great phone I had a Note 2 which leads loved just upgraded to the s7 from my s5 better display faster more memory smother operation all around better product Much faster than my s4 and has twice the storage  Not bloated with apps  Great display Im not so happy with the battery or the new emojis but the processor is faster than my S6 and the camera is really good Some of the new features are great This phone is almost identical to the S5 only a smaller screen on the S7  It works fine but I dont think its that much better than the S5 I upgraded from the S5 I likedont that phone a lot but the S7 feels and performs better in all areas Upgraded from S6 and really like this phone and its features I like the fast response from the phone I have ordered a case for it
due to it is quite slick and I want to protect it
Good experience so far and I do not see it changingstill learning the features My son who has learning disabilities utilizes this phone for many purposes  he can access his school email and google docs necessary for the completion of assignments It is a great tool for him Works great I needed a new phone Bought this a week ago and love it Nice camera Dont like that battery is not removable cant be replaced by user Battery charge doesnt last very long Very easy phone to use great quality and graphics The phone is not too big which I enjoy and is very easy to use The battery overheats when using GPS which is a bit concerning on long car trips Overall very happy with the 7 The phone is a nice step up from my S4 The transition was not too bad but I had to do quite a few things on my own to get the configuration set the way I wanted it I have had this a few weeks I like the new long life of the battery and the fast way everything works on the phone Some of the apps when transferred received a complete change in looks which I was not to happy with but overall its OK IVE ONLY HAD IT FOR 11 DAYS AND IT JUST GETS BETTER AS I LEARN ALL THE FEATURES IT HAS 1 Not all my contacts seemed to have transferred to the new phone were there some contacts on my old memory card that were different from the ones on the old phone If so is there a way to get all of the contacts from both locations onto the new phone
2 Not all my old apps transferred to the new phone I had to make a list and locate them on the Playstore and download again
3 Having all the Verizon apps and all the Samsung apps in one icon is not necessarily an advantage when Im trying to find something
4 The first app page is in alphabetical order but then the next app page starts off again with AZ I liked it better when all 4 pages were in alphabetical order
5 It just may be that I have to learn all over again how to maneuver with this phone which is unfortunate because I read the 300 page library book on my Samsung S5 from cover to cover S5 for Dummies but many things seem to work differently on the S7 Like the size and feel Struggling with customizationapp setup Switched from other OS and this seems over complicated I like the larger screen sizethe better camerathe longer battery lifethe fast charging 30 minutesall improvements over what frustrated me with my other phone Im very happy with my s7 phone This is a great phone I just bought this phone over a week ago and keeps turning off without notice It may have full charge and I may be checking something and turns off Theres been occasions that it turns blue saying my device didnt start correct and I need to connect it to the computer so it can start properly This product is amazing great features super fast great design the best camera and I like it very much This review was collected as part of a promotion Love it 
Yeeeeehaaaaaaa Have had an issue as did my wife  in placing phone calls When I try to place a call the call is cutoff in 12 seconds The phone has to be shut off rebooted and then the call will connect A real pain My wifes phone purchased 6 months ago did the same although it did go away after 10 days Great phone  Made transition from another Droid phone with not problem at all  Very user friendly Had it for a week and love it Other than the sound of love the phone Going from the S5 to S7 was an easy transition I do notice the S7 is faster has a much better battery life and the camera is superior to the S5 Im very happy with it And moving the power onoff button down a bit was good also Best phone Ive ever owned and theres been a lot of them including IPhone Bright vivid colors Loud ring tones Clear phone reception without background noise Lots of helpful and useful features  Fingerprint feature has been flawless Camera is remarkable Fast Internet action Glad I chose Samsung again This is the 3rd Samsung S7 in my family It is a great phone I have an iPhone from work and hate it This S7 is best in class While using Samsung VR it gets little hot but it is okay Bought a few weeks ago easy transition from iPhone Battery dies a little quicker than I hoped for Many great improvementsite from my old S4 and some that could have been left alone The bottom left button now just shows previous windows It was more useful as a menu button Ive only had this phone since a week before Christmas  Its my best phone yet  I love it and Im sure Ill appreciate it even more once I get used to all of the features and apps on it I like the expanded keyboard that includes numbers  However I have had some difficulty texting on the new phone the features that i have explored are those that i want and they are easy to use Bought on 1219 still getting accustomed to all the features Some features arent great Pretty much the same as my old phone Super simple navigation The phone is very fast Great camera Awesome features I upgraded from an Galaxy s5 to a s7 i love my new phone I am glad I stuck with the galaxy I bought it a week ago and I love it Had this S7 for a week Still getting used to using it as I had an iPhone previously Upgraded from a budget phone and couldnt be happier I got it a week ago and I am still getting use to it It had been a long time since I have purchased a new phone for myself all my previous phones were hand me downs and i was long overdue for an upgrade  I do not regret this purchase  The phone is sleek and such an easy transition  I choose to use the USB to file transfer all my data and it could not have been simpler  Having gone from a Note 4 to the S7 there was no guessing on how to operate or using features  And the camera is AMAZING  Near professional quality  I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is a Samsung Galaxy fan This is the best phone ever I am truly enjoying every minute of it ImageVideo clarity is outstanding and you will love to take more and more pictures This phone was an easy transition from my other Samsung 5  I am pleased with the features size and design Ive had this phone for 1 12 weeks and cant wait to return it The battery life is worse than my 3 year old Galaxy 5 Plus the case is so slick it forces you to buy a rubber case just to get a grip First new phone and it is really a nice phone Had the S3 and this seems to be a nice upgrade I used a Galaxy s5 for two years on contract with Verizon and although the s5 was a significant improvement over previous phone I had heard from friends that the s7 was a great phone
So I picked it up as an upgrade and the s7 exceeded my expectations Based on processor clock rate increase I was expecting a minor uptick in performance on some very slow performers on the s5 and could not believe the increase in performance startup primarily
The other surprise was just how good the fingerprint scanner performs What a relief to have a locked phone that requires almost no effort to unlock Thank you Samsung 
Im sure I will find the not so great things as I get to know it but so far its all good My husband and I recently upgraded our old LG G3 phones to this one and wow what a difference This phone is the perfect size I never really cared for how huge my LG G3 was its waterproof the battery life is amazing It lasts a lot longer than my LG G3 and the options and what you can do with it is awesome It also does not overheat at all and the fast charging cable works great I get a full charge in half of the time than what a regular charger gives me I also love the earbuds that come with this phone Very clear and awesome sounding i bought this phone and got poor customer services then the phone starts acting up and no one in the verizon stores can get it to work correctly i keep getting sound of notifications but no notifications Works well Looks great nice features I have had alot of problems with the S7 the messenger alert wouldnt work rebooted back to factory worked for a day then quit again replaced with another brand new one and now I cant get the fingerprint security to work  I was surprised that there wasnt much change between the S5 and S7 The features on this phone are never ending It was a small learning curve from the iPhone but completely worth it I would do it again in a heartbeat Apple has fallen from the throne and is no longer king This phone is easy to use and so customizable I really like the 1080p 30fps video it is absolutely stunning This is now the best phone Ive had to date  Previously had a Samsung S5  The step up has come with many more features and better performance Sometimes I like it sometimes I dont It is some what hard to get what you want I hate that if phone is off my alarm clock will not go off The others I had before worked like that Things I dont know how to do Samsung does not have a work shop near me Way cant they give you a book step by step I do not like this phone It gets really hot quickly  The large font is not large and unable to zoom text messages 
The key pad is touchy and too small I miss my Galaxy Note 3 It seems to be missing something I cannot edit my pictureson My screen has cracked in 2 places with the screen protector on it and pieces are chipped off I am not happy with this phone at all Wish I never got it Great battery life and easy to use This phone is by far the best iron ever had I just paid my note 5 off just to get this although I really didnt have the money at the time to do so but Im very pleased with this gambled I took thumbs up across the board The Galaxy S7 is exactly what you would want in flagship device Stunning design and great performance make this one of the best smartphones ever made The Screen is gorgeous with eye popping visuals and great color The phone is extremely fast in performing tasks The fingerprint scanner is much improved over the S5 and the battery lifecharging speed are great The only flaw I could find in this phone is that it can be a little slippery when used with one hand The large screen size compounds this issue and will make one handed use difficult for many people All around better phone than the S6 which I loved and good on samsung for bringing back the upgradeable storage First smart phone so far so good I bought this 2 weeks ago and no one explained that you had deleted some of the key features needed to make the phone a worth while investment I am very sad that you decided to delete the sensitivity of the touch screen to be used by persons wearing gloves Im not happy Great experience love the phone Really happy with the phone overall but was most impressed with the clarity of the resolution on the pictures and screen in general Not happy with reception I have had good luck with the Galaxy S5 But no reception ar Ohare which was strange My husband loves his new phone He has not put it down yet I first purchased a Samsung Thunderbolt years ago and appreciated its ease of operation excellent picture quality and functions availability I moved on to an S4 and the same qualities along with better battery life were apparent Friends had remarked about the picture quality of my postsNow that I have the S7Ive seen even better picture quality faster downloads great battery life and best of all easy to use features Except for the Better camera hardly any upgrade from the s5 was sold a defender case waste of money Almost impossible to use any pull down screens I am enjoying the Galaxy S7  and will be taking advantage of the Gear VR that came with my purchase  Also delighted that all photos transferred to the new phone  
S7 is easy to use lightweight and I will continue to investigate the latest technologyapps it provides I love this phone and all the features that it has However Im having difficulty with the drive mode it keeps turning on when Im not driving and doesnt turn on when Im driving This review was collected as part of a promotion I love the features and the simplicity of the Galaxy S7 Edge Great phone Plenty of features best camera Nice solid feal compared to my old S5 Also like the splash proof and expandable SD Memory slot Also very happy with the wireless charging capability I used a Galaxy S6 edge before using this phone For me the S7 is way better than S6 edge in every aspect I dropped and broke my S6 edge twice because the grip was so slippery however S7 gives a safer grip and I think the surface material is different Plus its got a longer battery life I like the always on display as I dont need to turn my cell phone on to check the time This review was collected as part of a promotion Replaced my old LG phone Purchased Samsung7 had lots of great promotions for holidays Bought this phone for my wife She loves the smooth transition and new options available to customize the phone Easy to use galaxy s7 Upgraded my Samsung Great brand  Up to date technology It was an easy transition from our old phones  to the Galaxy S7 I purchased this phone a week ago and got a great deal I love my new phone Not really impressed with all the apps that keep posing up and using a ton of data I got this phone a couple of weeks ago  Its nice but I have difficulty finding out what it can do Amazing phone  Im so happy I switched to this phone I looked for a couple of hours for the best way to transfer my datatexts contacts etc from my old Core Prime and couldnt find much help Finally I started opening up my new phone and lo and behold it was easy as pie Shut off the old phone turn on the Samsung Galaxy S7 let it initialize then connect the two phones with the supplied adapter and all my data apps text messages etc came over with the push of a button Verizon needs to work on that one to let you know its far easier than it looks I was basically forced to get this phone because I had to turn in my Note 7 that I had no problems whatsoever with  I dont like this phone I want my Note back I cannot wait until the Note 8 comes out I hope theres no issue this time around It is comparable to my S6  Nothing really better  The battery life is not really impressive if you use apps during the day  Overall I like it sometimes navigation does not work in out of city Only problems is tbe battery gets really hot and i cant keep a charge on it This was a horrible purchase I got this with the goggles asa Christmas presentbut thesalesperson did not disclose the phonewas financed on my bill for two years I returned everything and it ruined one of my Christmas gifts I still think I am being charged for the phone serviceso I disabled that line and now have no phone I will probably just remove that line and Im thinking of switching to another company after this I miss my Galaxy 3s I dont like the size of this phone Its heavy Also has bad reception People cant hear me very well and I cant hear them either Not happy Love the Galaxy phone Thought of going to another device but so glad i didnt Love all the features I bought the Galaxy S7 two weeks ago and it is getting better every day Plenty of processing power options for expandable storage and impressive battery life The rapid charge is outstanding I bought it a couple weeks ago its great Only been a couple of weeks  Its great Only had the phone a week or so So far love it
 Just got the S7 last week and am very impressed Reception and volume are much better and the camera resolution is awesome Still learning how to use certain capabilities Just upgraded from s5 and Samsung has added many new things to enjoy the phone I do like the info screen being on all of the time I am still learning the phone but glad I did the upgrade Totally happy with my purchase The Galaxy S7 is very much like the Galaxy S5 I  have not seen a lot of major differences The different ring tones and message notifications  have been very difficult to set I also have had three different customer service representatives give me three different instructions  I have requested an owners manual and operating instructions and have yet to receive it I have always been very impressed with Verizon and its professional services But this time I am very disappointed in the service and the lack of support in have received I do hope that this improves greatly in the near future I bought it a week ago I bought this phone because my son has one and he rated it excellent with above average battery life  I also upgraded from the S4 phone so not too much of a learning curve for me  I really like this new upgrade  Excellent phone nice Similar to the s6 but better battery Only hado for two weeks but impressed Love everything and great service Great features The battery doesnt last very long when listening to music or running an app like the S Health Love the S Health app though Nice phone great features a real step up from prepay phones It keeps crashing every time I try to open up any appsI would likexpect to have it replaced with an IPhone 7 Was past time for an upgrade and Im a Samsung loyalist Still discovering features and operation of the S7 Edge Had the GS 5 as my last phone and have used the other popular brand but prefer Samsung Converted friends over to these products when illustrating major differences and ease of use Will buy the SView case for the GS 7 since I found it convenient and useful for my 5 Original cases are too slick to securely hold I loved my galaxy 5 until it started freezing up on me after the uparades I switchexpect to this new phone and so far have loved the size shape and some of the new features Other features I will need to adjust to I could not be more impressed with my new Galaxy s7 This is my third Galaxy s series phone and this by far is the best Great design and features and easy to use and the camera takes awesome pictures Excellent phone and very happy with my purchase Havent had it that long so Im just enjoying using some of the new features Speed jump from S5 is very noticeable  Was well worth the upgrade The phone works great  There are lots of apps and accessories for the phone  They also have lots of deals to bungle up with the purchase of the phone We bought 4 phonesLike the phone very much had  otterboxes installed with a glass screen protector the protector diminishes the screen sensitivity and causes some typing errors yet the flip cover protects the phone so well we can live with small inconvenience 
We previously had S5 Samsung the seven is a faster and improved Galaxy The edge was driving me crazy I do like this one I bought it a couple of weeks ago and like the new features Way better than the Samsung 3 Ivery had forever Works perfectly I like it Smaller screen Battery doesnt last Havent had time to completely learn what it all can do Had it for a week now So far so good Good pics and batterylife I am not positive if I want to even keep this one Email sucks It keeps bringing up the same 8 or 10 hotmail emails as unread  multiple times a day every day Theyve been read but I dont want to delete them Keep herring notice of unread emails Kind of wish Id kept theGalaxy 5 Very happy with my S7 so far Setup was easy 
Bright and  clear screen Ive only had the phone a week but I absolutely love it The ease of use the userfriendly display  extended battery life and especially the fact that I can expand my memory as opposed to the previous model I wasnt going to buy a new phone My Galaxy S5 worked just fine However now that I have had the S7 for a couple of weeks I wouldnt trade it away It has a sleek design and very fast performance Fantastic product  very similar to S6 but better battery life Love the gold color and picture quality Thought the screen was bigger doesnt hold a charge very long
Wish I would have gone with the iphone Bought my phone after bootcamp and I absolutely love it This phone is junk  I came from a Droid Turbo 1 and theres nothing about the s7 that is really wow over the turbo  It feels like itll slip out of your hand any second and when it does the back will shatter search it  Why they did some kind of wrap around glass that wasnt more durable is beyond me  Mine is three days old took a two to threefoot drop and now looks like garbage    cracked on THREE SIDES from one fall  Its like getting into a lowspeed car accident having the doors fall off and the manufacturer denying that it had anything to do with how the car was built  Neither Samsung or Verizon will replace or repair the back So far I am very satisied Upgraded from Galaxy S4 to S7 Love the new features sound and quality Improved memory and Apps Overall am very pleased so far Anxious to see next update to system but love 601 and ability to move things to SD card Overall very pleased with phone I am happy that I made the switch to Verizon and upgraded to the Galaxy S7 Edge  The phone is loaded with features and easy to use By far the best phone I ever owned I switched from I phone and had the S3 S4 S5 and now the S7 I will never again get any other phone but Samsung Also own galaxy tab3 tablet and absolutely love it Ease of use amazing Battery life great I would recommend this phone to anyone Keep up Samsung I just jump back from a iphone6  This phone is different but so far awesome Keeps charge better cool I purchased this less than a month ago and I am taking it back  I have to charge the
phone every night  The battery drains in less than 12 hrs  Most of the time my phone is on stand by I assumed staying with the samsung line of phones that i would be happy Wrong i was happier with my s5 The s7 has crappie reception i drop more calls than ever before The phone shows i have sevice and yet drops calls were the S5 would carry the call If I hadnt cracked the back of the phone it wouldve been returned I didnt purchase a case for phone because after day 3 I knew I didnt want to keep the phone  The S7 burnt through 505 gb of data in one morning which Verizon was more than happy to take care of Very unsatisfied with the phone but am stuck with it now I get many compliments on it and it is easy to use which is very important Brought a week ago love S7  phones features The main thing I noticed right away is how long the battery last Very pleased with product and features I love this phone its durable and has everything I need all in one device I bought this device two weeks ago Im so happy with this phone  Great display size and ease of use Has all you need except for easy to find thick cases But I cant fault the phone for that Buying it new is expensive but thats to be expected I dont like the lack of grip on the back im coming from a galaxy S5 and the glossy back isnt my style but its still nice Its a phone it does what a phone is supose to do and more espically with the VR When talking on phone it sounds like the other person is far away and then close again I got my Galaxy S7 a little over a week ago and am very pleased with it The picture and sound is an improvement over my last phone and takes much clearer pictures The 7 is so much nicer then the 5 Galaxy 7 is better than ever I especially love the new themes you can get for your whole phone to change how all the apps as well as background looks Instead of individualizing each area it is all in one theme Downside is that there are very few that are free but the cost to buy one is cheap so I like my phone very personalized so its worth it to me I was used to being able to slide through about 4 or 5 app pages on the home screen but Samsung has combined them into a 2 page apps view and there are combined app buttons to put all of Googles apps into one file etc so you dont have to scroll so much to find what you need Love that Better placement of the microphone for more clear callsat bottom of phone instead of the back of it in previous models Great Phone good buy I am very satisfied with my whole experience when purchasing this phone I have had the phone for about 1 week and dtillcannot get it to read my email from Hotmail It reads Gmail great  Allows you toload Hotmail  Will even say it is talking to the mail server But will not show any messages New or old This phone has great features I am extremely pleased with the camera and its voice mode It also takes great pictures Seems pretty good  however not real impressed with battery life I brought this a month ago and wont get another phone  Like the features and the speed Wish the face was larger Ive only had it a week but I like it much better than the one I have  For one thing this one I can hear when I get a call or a msg  The other one was too quiet even with it turned up completely  Secondly this one pairs with my car blue tooth much better and quicker I needed an updated phone and made the right choiceI didnt want to have to learn a new device i was happy it was so similar to my Galaxy 4 Sister is extremely happy I just upgraded from the S4 to the S7 and although Im still getting used to it I love it so far The tutorials and tips are great if I need to reference them

I like the size is comfortable and the screen is clear and easy to read I really like the photos that I have taken so far and the apps are easy to navigate

The only drawback to the phone is that the earphone jack is now on the bottom rather than the top which is awkward when I set my phone on the treadmill Other than that I am enjoying it The Galaxy S7 is great It very fast and easy to use It is great with the Gear VR The phone kept freezing Non of the buttons would work It frooze for 6 hours I took it to the Verizon store and tgey replaced it Very happy about that but the new one has the same problem  heading back to the store  Hopefully 3rd times a charm Got my new Galaxy S7 for XMAS  Love it so far It constantly drops my email server where I have to continuelly put in my password to reconnect it It takes forever to load pages off the Internet where my iPhone 6 was instant Not easy to figure out how to use and comes with a lot of useless apps that drain your battery  The only good thing is the camera Would love to get my iPhone back This phone is basically the S6 except the frame is a little curvier and the camera specs are different I have had Samsung phones for many years and see no reason to switch brands Easy to use Love the new features I dropped my S4 recently so my upgrade was self induced Terrific phone Love it Got this has a Christmas present from my loving husband I love my s7 great pictures and I love the s health I needed a  new phone  it was a easy  transfer A very nice phone with fingerprint unlock nice camera great battery life Mostly everything about this phone is awesome However there are still some websites that do not work as well as they do on a laptop or even an iPhone However this phone also has many features better than iPhone such as the voice recognition The VR headset is also very awesome the S7EDGE looks and feel great but heats up sometimes This phone has a SD card I thing all phone should have them I dont like the way the voice command works and in general Only had it for a week Happy still learning I upgraded from an HTC one m8 and this phone blows it out of the water Its faster sleeker durable and waterproof Already talked my mother into switching from iPhone to the s7 edge which has the larger vertical screen and better battery My wife and I are both new Samsung fans and will definitely purchase our next phone from their lineup I have had samsung cell phones in the past this phone is awesome I cant believe how easy it is to use the screen is great easy on my eyes wonderful all the way around I wish my phone company did not have so much extra apps that cant be taken off only got 20gb out of 32gb thats the only downside I cant believe how much this phone does for me It loads so fast and makes calls so clear is feel more in touch with people when I call them This review was collected as part of a promotion Good phone easy to use I bought this phone less than a month ago  so far it is okay I came from Verizon prepaid to a contract phone 3 gigabytes of data on prepaid lasted me 2 weeks With the contract for whatever reason I go thru data much quicker I am unsure if it is because the phone is 4g prepaid phone was 4g or if it is because my old phone was not as updated So far I am not particularly fond of how quickly it burns data 

The only issue mechanically I have with the phone is that the home button has stuck very inconviently since day one If I try to hang up a call  the button gets stuck or sticks the screen flashes  glitches  I am unable to hang the call up I hate your positive blurbs that are so honey crusted I am planning to return the phone I have owned a Galaxy phone since the first one that Samsung produced Captivate I started smartphones with an I competitor which was very advanced for the time but Samsung soon pushed far ahead of the competition My last phone was a Galaxy S5 and I was not able to get the S6 due to my new carrier contract and now I have the chance to upgrade to a new phone S7 Edge and I have to tell you that the features and user friendliness of this phone are fantastic I am still finding new cool things this phone can do just by adding new apps and looking thru the settings menu The edge part of the phone is very helpful to get quick info jump to a app or open a photo Plus if yo are a new user to these phones there is the easy use option that allows you to do the basic things and clearly puts them out for you on the screen Easy Peezy The slim design and the fact that it is dust and waterproof make this a nobrainer when it comes to choosing a phone Thumbs up to you Samsung for another fine product It tends to overheat and after having it for only 6 months it has a very noticeable pink line from top to bottom which has become increasingly thicker and brighter and is very annoying considering how much I paid for this phone The sound is also somewhat offguess I got a lemon This phone is amazing The camera quality is superb and beautiful but sometimes if youre taking multiple photos in a short time frame Like when your child is doing something cute and youre trying to get a good picture the system either lags or wont take the picture at all Battery life at first was not good I even put it on battery saving mode and that made it go down even worse lol BUT you can avoid that by minimizing your push notifications unchecking the auto brightness turning off Bluetoothdata when its not in use turning off your location when you dont need it on pretty much just turning off what you dont need Its not too bad 

Daughter also spilled some water on my phone and it was still fine The phone heats up if you use it for long periods of time Obviously what doesnt lol and she also loves listening to music on it while banging the phone on the table

Overall its a great phone I havent got the chance to see everything that is in this phone but so far is great pairing Bluetooth to all my devises car stereo  a couple bluetooth speakers  home surround sound  
My son show me hoe cool is the VR googles are  This review was collected as part of a promotion The diplay seems more responsive than the galaxy s5  and the phone is just faster  downloads installs app programs  just runs faster and much better battery life While the price is high  its on average with other phones and you get what you pay for The phone is a headache I was better off before I traded up I cant believe I now have to pay a monthly fee to have voice mail Ridiculous I originally had the Samsung S4 and upgraded to the S7 much needed improvement Everything a android user wants Great design screen battery life Ive been a iPhone user for years and dont want to go back This phone is 100 I have had the phone for several weeks now and it has performed great I had this phone a week and it is great Purchased from best buy over a week ago and I hate the phone The functions are difficult to understand  there are too many pre programmed questions without explanations  after a week of use it barely holds a charge for 24 hours Very resistant
Its all I expected from the model it is according to my expectations a bit expensive and now it is lowering its price quickly the battery heats up a bit and after what happened with the note I worried I bought it in promotion included the Contact charger and a VR gear
The charger is excellent 
The GEAR VR IM STILL WAITING I hope IT WAS NOT MISLEADING ADVERTISING  Faster than my old S4 Phone is easier to use Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 which was also a great phone 

No complaints on new S7

Typical few days of updates to get all code on current releases During this time battery life was not as good as older S5 Understandable as the phone was working hard updating itself

Overall great phone 

Much better camera than S5 I love certain things such as wireless charging but the battery sucks  within 5 minutes after charging it dross 5  in 8 hours down to 2 like it but need to have more characters While it is great to have a new phone I should have just cleared out the memory of the S5 I had and gotten a couple of new batteries  For me the S7 has not shown anything new and different from what I had in the way I use a phone  The texting seems harder it does not understand spaces between words so I am always having to go back and clean up anything And the autocorrect is a mess   

It came with the quick charge station which sometimes does though more often does not actually charge the phone

So Yeah I got a new phone  Now for the next 24 months I will be paying for it And as I say with a car you should be happy when you write that check not sure I will be in this case Bought 4 Samsung Galaxy 7 phones a week ago so far so good I bought this phone almost two weeks ago I went from having a iPhone for five years to a Samsung Galaxy And I wish I switched years ago The features are so so much better then the iphone Theres less updates Better storage betting formats and my phone keeps me complete awhere of my usage and payments news updates and applications I feel a lot more in control and absolutely love this phone Happy to have upgraded my phone from the S5 Similar phone but new features Phones a Lil big but overall really goof I have only had this phone roughly 2 weeks but so far I am very satisfied with it It is a nice upgrade fom my nearly broken 2 year old  S5 Despite their recent issues I am a fan of Samsung products Weve always had the Samsung Galaxy phones and have never had any issues with them bought a week ago am pleased with the phone however I feel I was
sold a screen protector over priced when I should have been offered
an option for a lower priced screen protector Brand new to this phone runs very smooth Only complaint it doesnt really have a start off tutorial it only tells you how to do something AFTER you do it so makes it hard to fully understand it if your just pick it up Other than that I love it Love this phone Has a great camera also Had two weeks No complaints Best samsung smartphone ever  i could not ever dream about talking or surfing the web with a smartphone under the rain Everything was great about Samsung web site easy to shop online perfect packaging I have bought the holiday special package s7 with vr and wireless charging pad We had the S4 and just upgraded to the S7 It is fast and has a great camera We love it I got this phone as soon as my upgrade was due and I am so happy that I did Changed from Galaxy 5 to 7 Bought a 7 for my wife Both are extremely pleased with phone Good to go so far I have replaced my old cellphone with the new one It is the best phone I ever had Very tough and great performance After my SIII I went to an LG   So glad to have another Samsung Galaxy phone I will always buy samsung galaxy never apple products very good screen love the security and the expandable slot for sd cardTakes great photos My only complaint is the size just a little wide for me but then again i havent had a new phone in 4 years Battery life is great Performance is great lots of new things to get used to So far so good This review was collected as part of a promotion It serves my purposes Crazy fast awesome battery life amazing pics  Flawless Verizon service Not happy with it  I was disappointed to learn that Samsung doesnt offer Find My Mobile feature on new phones The Verizon rep I worked with on chat didnt know this He ended up transferring me to Samsung chat where I learned after their the Samsung rep went to look it up that the feature was no longer available One thing that truly turns me off a manufacture is when the remove features from a phone IR is just the latest feature to go MIA I used this all the time TV remote for home work locations and even in a bar I have just gotten the S7 edge and now I have to find out it is gone thru posts on the web I also notice issues with my SYNC bluetooth connection and some GPS apps I have had Samsung phones since S3 and now I will likely be sending the S7 back Very good phone only bought it as my old phones camera quit and I want to have something to take photos in an emergency  Lots of features that I will never use think it is too expensive but guess that is the name of the game these days  Also have not found an good case  As I woman I dont always have pockets to put it in and being outdoors quite a bit makes it bulky to carry and not quick to answer Overall I am pleased with this phone It replaced an older Galaxy S4 model Other than some differences in the look  feel of certain apps the things of most note to me are inaccessible battery the curved screen edges The battery is a bummer however  Cest la vie seems to be the order of the day The problem with the edges for me is the issue it creates with screen protectors They either dont fit well or are made smaller then the screen to avoid the edges Either option is undesirable In hindsight the S6 wouldve probably been a better fit for me Once again  cest la vie Im disappointed in battery life  It doesnt last 24 hours and I dont stream videos or do anything that uses a lot of data After 6 years of iOS giving Android a try on the S7 and enjoying it very much Transfer of data was quick and efficient Really enjoying making this phone my own with all the choicesoptions offered with Android Hardware is solid screen is brilliant speed is superb Smooth transition Can do all I did on iOS and more Just got this phone less than one week ago
Transfer of info From old phone  to this one was pure magic Still learning about the phone processes  
Fingerprint only works about 85 and yes I reset that with the same failure  Just started playing with my new phone and its amazing Easy to use and I love it I should have upgrade to this phone sooner great phone I thought I was upgrading from an s5 to s7 I cannot stand the changes It is not easy to adapt to the changes I am definitely not happy with the upgrade Finally upgraded from my S4 and it was definitely worth it Easy to set up and transfer data Very fast GREAT camera This product is as easy to use as a phone as it is a tablet When I dont have access to my laptop I know that I can always pull up information on my phone and have it right at my fingertips I really enjoy my experience with having this quality of technology at my fingertips Great phone but becoming problematic because Samsung has not updated security on unlocked S7 and S7 Plus since September Locked phone with carriers are receiving updates but unlocked US versions 930U and 935U are not Security should be number one concern Ive been an iPhone user this is my 2nd android  Im blown aways at how awesome the quality  craftsmanship they have implemented into this unit Watch was easy to setup and works perfectlyMany features Ive had my new S7 for a couple of weeks and so far so good I like all the various features as well as the design My only complaint is that the caller ID readout is not available out of the box You have to install a 3rd party application Ive had the S7 for about two weeks and the update was seamless due to the features of the phone  I really like the crisp performance and the time and date display I have used to Edge panel which very helpful and also the performance of the phone is fabulous Not only is the screen extremely susceptible to shattering but apparently so is the back The front and the back of my phone is shattered within 2 weeks of owning this phone I didnt even drop it when it shattered It shattered in my pocket Ive never had a phone thats screen shattered let alone the back of it shatter This product is a piece of garbage as far as Im concerned The best part is apparently the warranty was just changed less than a month ago that physical damage is no longer covered under the limited warranty Only had it for a month but so far so good  Battery performance is excellentbut time will tell as to whether it wears down over time  Dont see much difference from my S6 in the camera function yet as others have raved about This is an exceptional phone with excellent camera battery life and accessibilitya great choice
The features and navigation are super userfriendly and never lockup or failure requiring restart EVER I love it  Its a lot better than my old Droid Got the phone on upgrade because my S5 was dropped Camera was broken Great deal at local kiosk Ive only had my S7 for one week but the transition from the S5 was effortless  So far Im liking all the improvements I like the phone and the apps but I am having a hard time with calls breaking up and the 4g does not always come in  Videos are fuzzy sometimes and doing any kind of live streaming is always pixelated  I do not know how to fix this  I got this new phone about 15 days ago I already had to switch it due to the phone  Not really sure how to fix this but am really tired of not having calls come in well  Never had this with my old phone which was not an LG I switched from anow S5 couple of weeks ago and it has been so easy Copied everything over from my other phone and I didnt skip a beat I love the new features on the S5 like settings for safe places to not have password protected The glass feels so smooth I am having problems with my phone cutting out in my home I had no issues with my S4 Not sure what is going but am not real pleased Otherwise I like the phone This is a very well designed phone with excellent performance The S7 Edge is a beautiful phone Screen quality is excellent and the phone overall performs very well I had my first one for about 6 months and do accidently dropped it face down on my driveway needless to say that didnt end well However I liked the phone so much I got another one and this time made the smart choice to go with Samsung Protection Plus I have the phone for a couple of weeks and am pleased with it so far I upgraded from a S3 and the additional features in the S7 are great Great phone to have love it Very nice good service Excellent phone would recommend to any responsible person Great Phone I switched from an iPhone and Im happy I did Love the S7 edge Great phone Very fast I had tried a different phone the Google one about a month before this one and it does not comparebrought it back  the service reps were so kind about it  Then when my granddaughters phone went bad I went back  got a new one for me They reset my old phone for herno probs Bought it last month and glad I did So much easier to read things online this is my 3rd smartphone been happy with the  Galaxy S7 edge but my wife wanted something a little smaller so Galaxy S7 fit her needs  the verizon sales women was very helpful  picture quality is out standing best I have seen in a phone dropped phone facedown twice now on concrete from 3 feet no issues at all not even a scratch Battery life is good for its display  charging the Battery is a breeze very fast and will wireless charge  headphone jack also available Im happy with this phone I had so many problems with the multiple Note 4s I had that anything would be better Very good phone and easy to 5 I bought the phone on Black Friday  I didnt set it up for a few weeks  I needed assistance from a Verizon representative for the phone to connect to the Verizon network   Once it connected he walked me through the process of connecting my old and new phones and everything transferred   It was easy I purchased this as a gift The person is extremely happy I have had the Samsung Galaxy S7 for approximately 8 months now There are some awesome features included with the phone and there are some minor problems 

First I will discuss what I enjoy about the phone 
I really liked the phones ability to utilize splitscreen and I have not had any problems with the splitscreen feature thus far It comes in handy if you are watching a video and need to respond to a message transferring notes or messages etc without lag Speaking of lag the microSD slot is also very handy and it can free up the space so that it runs smoothly and the capacity is borderline obnoxious I have a 64GB card and have yet to fill it 

The phone is very very durable I have dropped it kicked it stepped on it dropped it in my soup and it comes out as a champion in my book because I obviously need a tough phone The waterproofing on the phone is awesome It has entered many hazardous aquatic conditions but remains fully functional

Talk about fast This phone charges in roughly an hour I couldnt believe how fast it charged the day I bought it and it is probably the greatest feature because I use my phone constantly and it drains the battery Note make sure you only buy Samsung chargers and boxes Other boxes and cables are iffy and some do not support Samsungs super fast charging

The display and sound are phenomenal The screen actually gets TOO bright at times but thats better than being too dim The picture quality is crystal clear and the sound can get very loud while retaining decent quality Another cool feature with the sound is that it can adjust with something plugged into the aux port to your sense of hearing It adjusts to optimize how you listen to music and can raise or lower certain sounds so that you get the best listening experience Also the Samsung headphones are the most comfortable ear buds in my opinion

If you use your flashlight half as often as I do then this phone is a winner The light on the S7 is a giant upgrade from the S6 It is noticeably more bright when compared to the S6 just try not to take pictures in the dark its blinding
The camera also takes very quality pictures Pro mode makes it easy to adjust the pictures for the setting of your choosing I personally enjoy taking night time shots so this comes in handy It also allows you to adjust the shutter lighting and focus which comes in handy if you want to take a picture of something very small or up close like an insect or flower

Now I will discuss what I found to be a nuisance
The phone is very very very very very susceptible to lagging Be very careful as to not run a million programs at once After you are finished with a program it is a good idea to close it down via the usage manager It also helps to free up space on the phone by utilizing the microSD slot

THERE IS NO IR BLASTER I dont know how it slipped past me but I did not realize it did not have the IR blaster If you enjoyed the S6 feature then you may want to keep your old S6 with you I really wish the S7 had the IR blaster but I got used to not having it

It has a short batter life as well but Im constantly using my phone so it sucks up power quickly I always carry my charger with me or a portable charger but there should not be much problems for someone who doesnt use their phone 247

The system is a little buggy at times In the past 8 months of sheer abuse it has only frozen once I believe I have restarted and shut off my phone maybe 5 times at most The screen overlay settingsthe thing that allows your messages and notifications to pop up while in a different app are very buggy I had to reset my phone which isnt a problem because I have a 64GB micro SD card because the screen overlay would not let me adjust it A majority of the time it is not the phones fault for crashes or lag its the fault of the apps

Overall I found this phone to be very durable and reliable It has some amazing features some I havent discussed because theyre alot of the features from prior galaxy phones There are some problems with it but those problems are very much manageable if one is careful and takes proper precautions while multitasking This review was collected as part of a promotion Great phone Its fast and has good battery After owning the Samsung Droid Charge the Galaxy S3 and the nightmare Galaxy S5 only after OS updates that should have NEVER been allowed this phone seems to do everything right and fast  ALL downloaded software runs without any glitches whatsoever  The camera comes right up and focuses instantly   Id put this phone up against any other including the highly overrated iPhone  Extremely happy with my S7 and Id buy it again in a heartbeat I purchased this phone online through Verizon on Black Friday as a gift for my son  Within the first day of use we noticed the phone getting very warm during the charging process  The battery life in only about 55 hours on a good day I am very comfortable with Samsung products Even though this phone is a bit heavy it serves my purpose Each day I find more that I really like Im not a big app user and I added only 36 gigabytes but 64 seems to be really good for me This product has instructions on operation that are fairly easy to follow I wish you would provide an Operation Manuel with your products so they would not have to ordered after the customer purchases the product I got this phone a little over a week ago  Love the improved performance over the GS5 Seem to be a couple of touch screen issues to be resolved though May be software I can use it for a day and then have to charge it  If I put it on power saving which limits performance it might not die by 9pm Other than that is a good phone with great features This product has excellent features However glass back was not a great idea Wont delete old address or email or phone number when contact info changes  Becomes very confusing which is new or old   Other than that I love this phone  Have had Galaxy 4 5 and now 7 This was an easy transition from my s5 I love the sleek look Had it a few days  Big improvement over old phone Good phone Like the waterproof feature Bought for Christmas present  Set up went good  Looks good so far So far so good I like Samsung phones and this has been the best so far Im not happy about the lack of reception this S7 gets I would also like to have a choice other than Chrome which seems to be only connected to my Gmail account BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE I bought this samsung galaxy s7 back in March Its been a constant struggle with the autocorrect spelling words that arent even close to what I typed out battery drains faster and faster camera lense is a glass cover that breaks easily and will cost 150 to fix apps run without being turned on Screen is too sensitive and messes with text messages or google searches You will also have issues with wifi It will say no connection when I am less than 3 feet away from the router Dropped and lost phone calls with people IN TOWN   Ive corrected the autocorrect at least 2 dozen times while typing this review Buy a different phone Its not worth the price tag even at monthly payments Autocorrect made typing this review a headache Have to go thru and correct lots and lots and lots of errors made by this phone BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to a S7 It was a very easy transition I was able to transfer my pictures with no problems The camera is so much better than the one in my old phone I would recommend this phone to someone that is interested in upgrading their service I have been a fan of Samsung products from the start Upgrading to the S7 is a no brainer Great design excellent battery life plenty of features the camera is awesome Loving the pbone aND the store I got it from Camera is much better than the S4 Nice bright screen I liked the motiongestures on the S4 so I  miss them but not a big deal I wanted a Google Pixel XL but had to settle for a S7 after the Note7 debacle But sadly the Pixels are not ready yet I felt forced and am not happy at all Awesome phone and features Great battery life   I used the internet to tradein my old phone and order a new one  Verizon could not have made it any easier to order understand the features and return the old one  The new phone is beautiful and easy to use Good phone amazing camera I love my New Galaxy S7 it has a large screen and the apps are so good and easy to use I was hoping to upgrade to a note 7 but with the issues I compromised Im so glad I did My s7 is amazing Quick speed beautiful pictures and compact We traded our galaxy S5s and so far everything seems to be the same Except the cases are very Slippery I recently replaced my Samsung Note 4 which was having battery issues with the S7 I thought going to a smaller size would bother me but so far its been a blessing feeling significantly lighter in my hand and pocket I havent noticed any performance issues and i do a lot of gaming The wireless charging feature is great The phone is good for what it is but nothing like the Note 7 I had I bought this a few weeks ago and so far I am liking it L over the phone but keep getting error message  Unfortunately calendar storage has stopped   occurs repeatedly and beyond annoying Bought this phone two weeks ago so far anyway its great The S7 is much faster than my old S3  The camera is great  However they have oversimplified everything and taken away most optionsThe predictive text is terrible  The S3 had a way to improve this as you went by selecting the correct word but it wasnt off much  The S7 is terribleMost choices it provides arent even words Usually I am a happy Samsung customer over years however this S7 phone is exception

It heats up badly and battery drains very fast

Fast charging does not work after couple of months It takes more than 12 hours to full charge very slow charging currently

Slow performance hangs  delays in touch screen Overall bad experience Will return it soon and never to use Samsung phones especially after Note 7 news The cost was better than the same phone used from Swappa Great phone with great features Very happy that I switched from the 7Edge to the 7  Loved the Edge but I dropped it and the screen brokefirst time Ive broken a phoneknock on wood I love this phone so much Some people said iPhone can be better but in my opinion Samsung or any Android is way more superior I can customized and do lots more things toward my Samsung S7 edge It has more features and way more apps that I love Besides it has sdcard compatible and waterproof Best phone so far Unlike my Galaxy S5 the S7 has a buggy email program using the standard email app with a POP3 account  Messages that have been deleted and no longer exist on the server are piling up in the phones inbox and you cant make them go away even after another email app has deleted them from the server replaces my note 7 with galaxy s7  battery barely last the day phone is hotter than my note every got   would not recommend this phone to anyone Ive been limping along with an old S4so thrilled with the new S7 Has been the most reliable phone I have used Greater features and apps This review was collected as part of a promotion While this was a downgrade from the failed Galaxy Note 7 I am still happy with this device pretty much all the features of the note 7 Great Price Great screen and speed Im coming from a iPhone 5s to the S7 Although the phone has a much larger display it fits well in my hand Would recommend going for the regular S7 if youre someone with smaller hands Screen is great very customizable with the new Android 601 installed Fingerprint scanner is super fast Still testing battery performance but so far I used it with medium web browsing and social media use while paired to a bluetooth watch and after 8 hours it was only at 66 so basically so far so good Easy to use Battery is way better than my S4 I bought this on black Friday and happy but have a couple of questions regarding why i was charged a usage fee on my last bill I also cant get my email to pull up All the features are great and the upgrades are noticeable The camera is awesome and it doesnt overheat with games I have been using this phone since September 2016 and I just love it I upgraded from the S5 wouldnt go to the S6 due to both contract issues and no SD card Takes really great pictures and I now have plenty of room to add back all of the apps I ended up having to delete just to use the basic ones efficiently with the S5 such as email I have been using the fingerprint feature for security and it works pretty well although I have found sometimes when my finger is cold that doesnt work as well guess my finger shrinks  

The only issue I have run up against are 2 apps that cannot be run together while using bluetooth Slacker Radio and Google Maps cannot be used at the same time while plugged into my car to charge it via USB Every 510 minutes it just shuts down and reboots itself I believe the 2 together were overheating the phone But that is a part of the review I will send to the 2 app developers to see if they can fix that

Highly recommend the phone Although it could still have less bloatware but Im sure that is not a Samsung issue but a Verizon and Google issue range of wifi and bluetooth almost double volume real good battery a little short but I use gps a lot Upgraded from an S3 Has surpassed many of my expectations The split screen multitasking capabilities are perfect for the professional on the go Also the great picture quality is great for taking pictures in any situation This review was collected as part of a promotion everything i expected it to be and more great for gaming also Very glad for the new Android phone Easy to use and understand the features Using the phone as my daily driver it works great for me to communicate with friends and family One of my favorite features of the phone is the smart view feature which I use often on my Samsung Smart TV The phone also has great multitasking features with its 64bit processor I used every phone in the whole Galaxy S line starting with the Galaxy S Vibrant and the phones just keep getting better and better every year I bought two months ago online I was think Big it was going to be different than the iPhone 6 but it really wasnt So I was a bit disappointed and wondered if I couldve received a better deal and bought on iPhone 6s I didnt want to mess with it do just kept the 7 The camera is nice and I like the slimmer phone Its definitely an upgrade from 5c Nothing negative so far or even marginally unsatisfactory I just bought this so I have not had time to test it our I like the style and the ease it is to use This review was collected as part of a promotion Purchased over black friday weekend Great phone had the s5 so it is pretty similar Only negative so far is that the battery life isnt much improved over s5 model At least from what I can tell It does seem faster and more responsive i just went to a rock concert and had the best video and pictures ive ever taken on any phone ive owned Hard to teach an old dog new tricks Ive been so pleased with my new Samsung S7 I had a Note 4 and was bummed about not being able to get another Note but have been so happy with my S7 The interface is excellent Havent run into any glitches Fast and has great battery life Excellent camera Love it The phone was a bit complicated to transition to Didnt work at first I had to call Verizon I was told my apps etc would transfer but never did Im an Etsy seller and my Etsy app doesnt work like it did on the S4 Frankly Im struggling to see what has been upgraded other than the size of the screen The fingerprint lock is also a pain which doesnt work half the time This phone is the best phone ever except there is a few things that are minor and I do not like about it
1 It would have to be the all glass make
Why you might ask
On the back of the phone it has alot of fingerprint attraction If device is dropped it is easily broken scratched or other things possible to the device I have an S3 and it is very user friendly I have yet  after two weeks to figure out to install Skype and FB on my new S7 My Note 3 is the greatest Samsung yet  that being said this is truly the second best thus far surpassing all competitors and i am a commited user In my opinion and that is the only one that really matters this is the best phone ever hhhmmm was very disappointed when I had 2 return not 1 but 2 brand new phones because they kept rebooting and getting hotyikesscaryI am now an Iphone user    I love this phone and think it works really great as a phone and a camera The camera is so detailed and there are so many great edit features for photos I love how sleek it looks and the edge makes everything so much more user friendly in terms of readability I love this phone I like the bigger screen the options of split screen the ease of moving around icons on desktop  The camera is greatly improved Bought it two weeks ago and enjoy battery life improvements I bought this phone for my grandson who really wanted an Iphone But he absolutely adores it Beyond annoyed   Phone workssorta   cant send pictures via text   When I try to do so I get an invalid address message   Can send regular text to the same numbers with no issue   I can receive pics via text but the appear in a separate conversation   Googled it and saw others with the same issue but no solution   Trying to reach customer service thru the app causes the app to crash   Really tedious and the idea of standing in the store waiting for a salesman that is so young hes still squeezing pimples rates as high on my want to list as getting a prostate exam from a gorilla with Parkinsons I love the ease of use and the battery life  Thought I would have trouble switching from LG to Samsung but it was very easy to get used to  Still learning about all the functions of the phone but am very pleased with my choice A couple of weeks in and I love it Fast charge and easy to navigate My last phone was an S3 Hopefully I will be able to keep this one for 4 years too I am using this phone for work but the camera is AMAZING I thought the S6 was fantastic compared to my wifes iPhone 6S but this thing blows that out of the water Also copying all my data contacts and images from my old phone was a complete breeze I received my phone a couple weeks ago and just enjoy the heck out of it  I love the Samsung phones over Iphones  Easy to use and think Samsung is a better product I bought this a couple weeks ago and pretty satisfied however my headphones dont work and cant talk  text The sound is better than my landline The most beautiful phone out there Fast and responsive My only complaint and a minor one is that when shooting the camera in Pro Mode and saving DNG raw files when I shoot a closeup or zoomed shot the camera saves the jpeg file perfectly but the DNG file is full resolution Certainly not a deal breaker but Id like to see that flexibility added in an upgrade or at the least added to future gens of the GalaxyMitch Ive only had this phone for about a month now but I miss my Motorola Droid  This phone is a lot smaller than I am used to so when Im in the middle of typing something my hand accidentally hits another part of the screen causing it to close everything out  I also find the emojis to be odd looking  I dont really care for the ringtones on here  The only good thing i can say so far is the camera is decent  Everyone keeps telling me I am going to love it but I am still waiting on that After having a Motorola phone Samsungs voice assistant is terrible The battery seems to drain really fast when Im actually doing stuff on my phone like browsing xcetera Also I have had some pretty disappointing selfies so far Bought the new Samsung S7 Edge about 2 weeks back The battery drains away v fast The camera quality is not great Fitbit app does not work The image quality is not as great as Iphone 

Though the phone has good resources compared to iphone like memory or battery but performance is not good The speaker volume is not good The price of the Product is more compared to its offering Coming from Motorola phones this was a huge performance increase My old Droid was touted as the best battery lasting device I was lucky to go 10 hours even when new This S7 puts that Motorola to shame along either a better camera that doesnt hesitate when snapping a shot I mostly use my phone as a phone but the additional features I do use are much faster and smoother Very satisfied Great screen resolution Smooth style I like this phone Phone is definitely a step up from the S4 Happy so far Operates much faster than the S4 I previously had Wish I had this phone years ago it is awesome I had to trade in my Note 7 and was left with this  Its ok but of course its NOOOO comparison to my Note  Hopefully Samsung will offer some type of incentive when the S8 releases next year The S7 gets very hot when charging and when you use it for a long time  The speaker   is not the best  Overall it is a Samsung and you know what to expect  It is very sensitive around the edges I bought the phone on black Friday  I waited 7 months to purchase because the retail phone price was too expensive  I find the screen very clear and the processing very fast  The phone charges very quickly Satisfied with my new phone only issue is the battery life The best thing about the phone is the camera I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago to upgrade from my S5 and I am very happy with performance so far  It was very easy to transfer over all of my data and apps with Verizon Cloud and Content Transfer I have all of my messages pictures and documents  I really like the fingerprint function to unlock my phone which makes it secure and quick to access I also enjoy that it is slightly smaller in width than the S5 which is easier for me to hold and fit into pockets Works like my S5 did Its nice having the expandable memory card Im a little concerned there arent port covers  for waterproofing  But Im not going to test it   If you have liked previous versions of the Galaxy  its great  It has very similar options and features but more streamlined and quicker I traded this in to replace my note 7 and I couldnt be happier A great phone with a reliable engine Id tell anyone unsure which phone to get should seriously consider this device It a great phone compared to my s4 more features and faster I have been an avid Samsung user since smart phones hit the market and this phone is garbage The battery life is terrible it hardly lasts a day with minimal use in power saving mode My device overheats all the time and drains the battery or just shuts off Verizon customer service was less than helpful when this is under manufactures warranty they would not replace my device unless I did a full factory reset which I was unwilling to do as I do not want to risk losing everything on my device I am extremely disappointed in this device and will be reluctant to buy another Samsung product Samsung SmartSwitch App makes transition very easy Better camera than S5 Upgraded from s5 to s7 Ithe constantly drops the connection when using streaming appreciate like Pandora  Ill be contacting support I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the Galaxy S5 So far it is working better than my previous phone regarding speed and a few more featuresI love the increased access to my most used apps on my home page Previously the app icon access was limited requiring scroll to other pages to find apps I havent had time to explore much of its capability or the picture quality yet but hope too soon I love the notifications time date and battery display with the Always on Display feature without unlocking the phone The Smart Switch app and the Verizon rep made it easy to transfer the old dataapps from my previous phone to the S7 Also love that unsaved callers are identified now with calls Will make it easier to avoidblock telemarketer calls and to add new friends to my contacts The option for 2 apps on the Lock screen is also great I love that the Verizon apps and the Samsung apps are organized into separate files and not with the rest of the apps  makes it easier to find The only negative thing is the sensitivity of the screenkey board is not quite as good as my last phone I often have to repeatedly press the screen to finish a text I have been very pleased with my Samsung phones and will likely continue with this product line Purchased 10 days ago horrible decision Have had phone for two weeks and am very happy with it so far Still discovering new and better features 2nd week using phone Overall it is fast Google maps mysteriously work better with this phone than previous versions Why I  dont know But I deliver pizza Ive noticed a big difference in accuracy Sound is great Only problem with this phone is that manufacturer did not provide a good user guild to go with it So I spend a lot of time figuring out how things work Also Very few choices for wallpaper Bought this phone for my husband and he absolutely loves it I love it great phone very happy and excited about the endless posibilities Love the phone but keep getting a notification for incomplete activation Verizon is sending a new simple card hopefully that is a fix Bought the s7 a bit ago and Im glad I did Keeps up with all the apps I like to run even many at once Great picture quality with a sleek design back of phone shattered still works though can no longer talk text too much junk apps loaded from factory Im happy with the new features So glad I switched to Verizon I was with Sprint for 16 years  I amWay too loyal  Very happy with phone and service Even my dog likes my new phone Love my S7 It can really take typical abuse Went from a Note 2 Loved that also Verizon beats Sprint hands down Ive had my phone for almost a week now  I have had a pretty easy time learning the new features considering my last phone was  a Galaxy 3 Ive had the phone for  3 weeks now  It was simple to transfer all my email contacts pictures and text messages from my old Samsung S5 to my new S7 I have much trouble taking the phone from my pocket or purse to answer a call  The call gets terminated and I am sure I am touching something wrong when I pick the phone up  Very frustrating  Other than that the phone is fine for my simple and minimal needs I was excited to get this phone after severe problems I had with Motorola 3 replacements  Everything was great faster more clear phone calls faster charging everything  

Almost everything  The battery life is pretty bad  I charge it a couple of times each day  But like I said before the S7 charges much faster its fairly easy to do and can charge fully from nothing in about 40 mins  Just remember that when youre getting ready to buymake a decision I like the easeofuse and features with the Samsung S7 I would recommend it to anyone Ive had this phone for a few weeks nowoverall it gets the job done but it often gets very hot to the touch Happy with phone service and reception Love samsung phones Not an apple guy only improvement would be a more textured outer surface to keep from dropping phone all the time Smaller then the s6 edge plus that I had by far Everyone would like this phone If you are a beginner its great I am very happy with my phone have not figured everything out and it is definitely smaller than the Note 4 I love it Ok I have had the phone for almost 2 weeks and these are my observations The first glaring sore thumb is the battery It charges wireless perfect However after very mild daily use the battery drains down to 50 by the time I get home from work and I barely use it Another problem is that when waking the screen sometimes it just turns off immediately  after waking it Those are my issues Another then that the phone operates as expected I love this Phone but needs more QA testingit gets really hot and stops working I have been happy so far I bought this 10 days ago and a definite improvement over my old phone however learned that the regular protective glass not so good need the curved glass for best results Im happy I got a new phone was hoping for better battery life with this smart phone from coming from an S4 hopefully the phone lasts more then 2 years before battery does completely Very easy to figure out right out of the box While i have yet to go through all of the features I feel comfortable enough to give the product a review I would like to see more features utilizing the edge screen Getting ready to start using the Gear VR so cant wait to experience that Battery drains fast no IR TXRX overpriced like just about everything on this planet Ive had this phone for 2 weeks and Im enjoying the upgrades  features better camera more memory 32Gb and more organized home screen I wanted to try the S7 edgecouldnt get used to it  With the S7 I guess I should take a classes to learn this phone  Im wondering if I could change to an iphone instead since my children have it and they could teach me I have been using my new samsung s7 for a few weeks now and i really like it The battery lide id mush better that the s4 and the transition was very easy It operates very smooth and is noticeably faster than its predecessor  Great camera very fast download speed everywhere its used and Im very happy that it doesnt have a glass back  I like the added feature of being water resistant  The display is crystal clear  But it is lacking 2 features that my previous phones have had   It does not have infrared which worked very well on the s6  It was a very convenient feature that I miss   It is also lacking an fm receiver which I used a lot with my LG g3 to save data and still be able to listen to the radio   Overall its a very solid phone that is a pleasure to use I love this phone Its a lot like the s5 but better Just got the phone a week ago So far very pleased with it No problems with it yet Ive only had this phone for about two weeks and still getting used to it Overall I am very happy with my S7  However the speakerphone is not as loud as I would like  Its fine for music and apps but not so much for phone calls on speakerphone Love the Galaxy S7 It is very user friendly I really like that it is water resistant I havent put it to the test yet but I am outside a lot so this option was very important to me I also like that it can accommodate a large amount of added storage through a San disk I have had this S7 about 2 weeks now  We love it  It performs very much the same as our S5 so it was an easy transition  Apps phone etc are faster  The camera seems to take good pictures although I havent used it much  No complaints so far Bought it to replace the S5 which was also a great phone and love it
Recommend getting one Dont really see any difference from the S6 Smart looking easy transition from the S5 all in all just a better device So far so good I moved to this phone after over 3 years with a Motorola Droid Maxx  its a little bit of a letdown its a little bit faster in the screen is a little bit better but the battery still barely makes it through a 16 hour day If I talk  on it for more than 45 minutes  during the day I will have to charge it when I get home at 6 PM It does offer quick charging which is nice but I wouldve preferred 4000 mA  battery instead of the 3000 mA installed in the thing The Motorola phone was an upgrade from an HTC  which was pretty lousy I guess I expected more  from the galaxy  instead it feels like a lateral move On the  upside  at least the galaxy doesnt randomly reboot itself once or twice a day This phones coolbut would be a lot more fun if Verizon followed everyone else and offered unlimited data as this phone uses a lot Really thinking about sending it back and getting the same phone through Sprint Been a Verizon customer 13 years and can get more data cheaper through a competitor Great phone an easy transition from my S6 especially when you put everything in the Verizon cloud Hi

I like the telephone but had to return the telephone since it would not allow me to use my yahoo email account for my personal and business use I have two open tickets for the issue Great features and quite easy to adapt to from my previous phone  Has many good new features Phone and company arent what they used to be I wish I would have stayed with the S6 The S7 does not have the same functions if anything less functions than the S6 I bought this phone on black Friday I was excited to get it but after a few days I realized my S4 had many more options for customizing This phone does not do near as much as my S4 My S7 loses signal where my S4 never did Phone is the perfect size for my wife She had a turbo 2 before which was too big and was missing some features the samsung has  like the notification led  So far its been a great phone I just got my new phone and I DO NOT like it I had a Galaxy s5 and LOVED my phone the features were so me not this one There is no smart alarm No air view The SD card is a different size The transfer of data was great I just dont like the s7 I loved my s5 Traded my S6 for an S7 and basically getting it for free Love Samsung and Verizon Purchased to replace an aging LG and have had  iphones as well this phone is much better More user friendly and great features Great camera and display I like the phone  I see no difference from my S5 except the camera is better
However I CANNOT turn down my notification sounds from texts  No matter how far low I drag the slider its LOUD  The sound wont change  After googling it Im seeing others have the same issues Got this phone a week ago Ive had the first galaxy s3 s5 and now this the s7  Ive also used the LG g2 and g3 Up until this point my favorite phone has been the g3 but now the s7  has surpassed that Runs great amazing camera beautifully designed convenient features just the full package The only thing its missing is the ability to be a remote control In the s7 they took out the infrared I miss that Glad I upgraded my phone and special happy to be back with Verizon Had horrible coverage and always lost my signal with att cant be having that as aneeded our driver now can I The phone is easier to use and has less annoying sounds than the Galaxy S5  Really like the sleeker look even though it is just slightly larger than the S5  Hadnt upgraded in 3 years  Glad I did  After 3 yrs the S5 was starting to act weird I dig this phoneworthy upgrade from my Galaxy S6 Android 60 is alright but I miss 4 The style and features of 4 were more expandable and customizable 6 has more features but at the cost of more specific settings If theres a way I can keep performance speed but get aos4 back Id like to know Please and thank you But overall I cant complain too much about this phone Especially since I just upgraded from a S4 six hours ago I havent had the chance to build a relationship with this phone We purchased a couple of these to replace the S4  I really liked the S4 and had no issues The S7 has totally different sound quality which is hard to get used to  It sounds like you are talking into a tin can  or in a small room  They tell me its the same for the person you are talking with as well must be the mic and speaker  Camera seems to be good  Getting use to all the new features now  seems fine  Bought a case with a semi transparent front that protects the glass  really like it So far so good To soon to tell Love it so much nice feel Overall Wonderful Phone I truly love this edge feeling

If you have big hands while holding the phone you can touch the screen by accident and cause to click on something 
texting wonderful Just phone goes real slow when receiving a text as you are typing one Love my phone So easy to use Great phone intuitive easy to use My S5 was the best phone I ever had so I was slow to part with it but Im glad I did This new S7 is almost the same in size and feel but the resolution speed and camera are noticeably improved Good phone but kinda expensive I enjoy using all of the services provided on my Samsung and the ease of adaptability when other applications are added Very pleased with our third upgrade with Verizon and the programs they offer with the latest and greatest devices to boot I got this phone about a week ago It replaced my galaxy S4 I enjoy how my picture look with the HD It takes some getting use to the buttons  Some features like notifications I  dont like because they dont have the same options from the other model I bought wanted the edge they were out so I had to settle for this I really like this phone I was overdue for an upgrade and when this phone had a good promotion I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 I dont like this phone as much  I find that my old phone was more userfriendly but the camera is definitely sharper on this phone I hate that the phone is smaller and find adjusting to the nownarrower keyboard a pain 
Otherwise its ok like pretty much every Galaxy Best phone I have had yet Easy to move everything from my old phone and it is easily expandable Love the sound when talking to someone else  Pics are great  Frustrated with all the various popups wanting you to purchase or upgrade to other products The videos and the pictures looks much better Nice and easy to operate I love this phone  I love an Android phone  No IPhone for me  This is my 3rd Samsung Galaxy  Great new features and still learning how to take advantage of the new features  Nice clear pictures on the camera  Happy I made the right choice    S5 was great s7 is basically same phone Love the phone but my salesperson did not fully explain how my bill would come out so trying to find a way to afford this great phone In my second week love the phone takes awesome pictures and so easy to setp Plus it looks good too  Loving my new phone so far It has a couple quirks I am trying to figure out still Great phone fast great camera I ended up with this phone after the Note 7 recall  It is alright as phones go and if I wasnt used to the more comfortable screen size and awesome stylus of the Note 7 then Id probably have given this product a higher review  Basically its the phone Im stuck with instead of the phone I truly desired The S7 has BY FAR the absolute BEST voice quality Ive ever had on a cell phone  Incoming calls no longer sound like the caller is talking into a tin can    My wife and I love the display and all the new ways you can customize it  Having 32 Gig opens up space for apps for which I did not have room on my previous phone  I missed the ability to set the back and app history buttons to stay lit whenever the phone is in use  Fortunately someone wrote an APP for thatand Im running that  those are the hotspot areas to the immediate LEFT and RIGHT of the actual button at the bottom of the phone    We also got the fastcharge wireless charging pad and find it very usefulno longer have to fight with the charging cord to get it just right to fit into the charge port I bought the device on black friday and love it The S7 is a great phone Its fast has plenty of memory and takes outstanding pictures If you have bought into the Android ecosystem whats not to like about this phone Buy it Buy it Buy it I cannot get it to connect to my PC Have had this new S7 two weeks and Im loving it  The transition from my S6 was really seamless I was concerned the camera would not be as good as my previous S6 since it has less megapixels but no worries  The camera on the S7 is even better  And I certainly like the ability to add a microdisc for additional data  storage especially for photos Just love it
It does all i need from a cellphone Faster than the old phone Better video graphics I bought  the phone 8 days ago and it was over heating the 2nd day I took it back to the store to get another one and Im still waiting on my new phone they said they couldnt just give me another one that they had to order another onethey told me it would arrive in 2 days and a week later I still have a overheating phone Im disappointed in Verizon for not helping outmakes me want to change providersin have been with Verizon 12 years and this is unacceptable As for the phone if I ever get one that functions properly I might like it Have had the Galaxy S7 for 2 weeks now  Not as easy to use as my old Galaxy S4 I think I got a real deal  Like the phone so far I got this phone a week ago and couldnt be happier with my decision to get the Samsung Galaxy S7 I had got the Note 7 and Im sad to say that didnt work out When I returned it I got a iPhone 6S Plus because Id never had an iPhone I thought Id try it Well I didnt care for the iPhone it was way different than the android phonesIve ALWAYS had android phones so it probably was a big factor in my decision to take it back I got the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Im Loving it 
Thank you Very Much
Elaine Thompson Overall a solid phone from Samsung Hate the Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery life is better than with the S5  Especially since I use it to read the newspaper  I took a while to get it setup to access the various apps we use  Still trying to get the basic voicemail to work the way we want  we dont want the visual voicemail  Like being able to add a microSD card  We put all of our photos on it  When we upgraded the phone we just took the photos to the new phone using the microSD card  Hate not being able to replace the battery  thus the 4 star rating Finally retired my S4 yeah I know once I found that the standard S7 would fit in my ridiculously expensive cast that Ive been using  So far it actually seems like a worthwhile upgrade First time Ive transferred to a new phone myself got it mailed Worked fine Love the phone S7 took a bit of an adjustment from using my S4 Found my old S4 makes a nice tiny tablet now on wifi  Its been an awesome battery life Great upgrade Too many features too many settings typingautotextcorrect feature sucks Maybe fun options for teens and young adults but for an 39 yo extechie it isnt user friendly Much prefer iPhone Wastes less time Props for nice screen and camera but otherwise a pain in the  Received just last week and so far am loving it  Setup was simple and I like the way the phone feels in my hand  Its slightly skinnier than the S5 I had and I like that Good phone what I wanted Works perfectly Nothing else to say Very happy with the new phones First Smart phone Still learning Have only been using this for about two weeks and was able to easily adapt from using the Galaxy 5 just purchased it so time will tell Bought a couple of weeks ago Only complaint I have is battery wears down too quick I bought this phone last month and I already like it a lot I really like the HD calling
Makes you feel like you are having a face to face conversation I love it faster than last phone The screen is so much brighter and clearer  Much easier to read Some contact information was lost in transfer Upgraded from Galaxy S6 Edge The 7 is similar but pictures are better Not sure if its my service or the phone but I notice a lot more dropped phone calls I have rarely had this happen with my s5 and now its dropping calls pretty regularly Battery also doesnt last 1 day which is disappointing Love the phone love the service  Hate the finger print ID as it is very unreliable Satisfied overall Only issue is keyboard should have went with the edge since it is somewhat bigger and I have big hands Love how fast it charges Ive only had this a short time but its very similar to the S6 and havent had an issue yet Ive only had it less than a month but so far I like it a lot I really like that they got rid of that little flap thing that covered the charging port I hated that thing I like the phone isnt any bigger than the S5 if it is its very slightif its smaller thats also slight I only wish they came in more colors than black or gold I got the Gold and its beautiful I hope the S7 is more durable than the S5 I had previously I have had it less than a week so far but it feels better durable Ive only had the phone about a week but so far it has been excellent Some differences on the S7 vs my old android that are very handy are having the number line at the top of the keyboard and the relocation of the speech button I went from the s3 to the s7 and Ive got nothing but good things to say about it Im in an rural area where coverage is intermittent For some reason there is no ATThe coverage at my home There is reception with Verizon but the signal reception  was better for my Galaxy S5 than it is for my S7 It is an okay phone I expected it to be more user friendly This review was collected as part of a promotion Glad I purchased this Samsung Galaxy S7 it is similar enough to my Samsung Galaxy S5 that it was easy to figure out but has more storage and is faster with a longer battery life  Best Android product there is in my opinion Love everything about the phone I bought this to upgrade my s5 It works fine but is a little more confusing to figure out The transition from my HTC Droid DNA has been slow I find useful new feature by accident more than going to any kind of guide or blog Im not as impressed by the battery as I hoped to be that was a key reason to upgrade at this time Have had the phone for less than 1 wk and Im still getting used to it Interesting upgrades from my old S4 My selfies are more crisp the screen is brighter So far I like this phone I had a galaxy s5 for over 2 years and switched to this one about a week now Definitely not a bad phone Do not buy glass screen protector Waste of money Glad I made the change Nothing really exciting with the new phone 
Better camera more battery less screens
You can use folders but nothing to brag about
Its a good replacement for my s4 Just bought it a few days ago Havent had any issues yet I think its struggling to load images in browsers but not sure if thats the phone or something with the software or something Great phone great phone I got this a couple weeks ago 
Wasnt going to however my S5 died 
Like to the date seems they give me a refurbished 5 ta start with Good phone  havent had long enough to give a good review like battery life 5 times better than old phone Just bought it Black Friday Really like it so far Love the memory pictures and large screen Nice device the only issue I have is the battery life every day that goes by that ease it is to enjoy the phone I bought this phone a week ago and it getaway the job done There are a few differences but pretty much easy to use Easy to use nothing spectacular very disappointed in the camera and battery life kind of short I got this about a week ago its awesome glad I chose this galaxy 7 Quality is outstanding Features are great Was forced to turn my note 7 in and this was the closest to it Glad I upgraded recently from the S5 Phone seems to be doing good except for battery life If you use the phone for surfing the Web or using apps battery dies fast Fast charge is good for outlet charger but I have to see for car charger The phone works fine the camera works fine but the Do Not Disturb feature does not turn of notifications Calls and texts do not come through but the only way to turn off notifications is to turn off alarms So the choice is to get email notifications all night and get the wakeup alarm in the morning or to have both silenced Not the ideal situation while sleeping or while in a meeting I would like a phone update to rectify this situation Good more storage 

Irritating predicated spelling is awful Phone wont learn my correct emails continually puts the wrong mail service with the wrong name Great phone upgraded from Samsung 4 So much better than apple products This phone is great I have not dealt with any issues I just use it daily and for everything I need it to do  it does Great product replacement from the galaxy S5 Phone is fine but the S7 screen is curved making it next to impossible to find a good glass screen protector that provides anything close to full protection without a loss of touch sensitivity andor image quality

Im on my 4th different brand at this point and none work as well as the protector on my S6  The best sensitivityscreen image protectors do not attempt to cover the curved edge leaving roughly 31614 unprotected all around and putting the edge of the protector clearly in the screen image

The fullest coverage products will cover the entire screen but tend to cause rainbow distortion in the center due to adhesion problems and also have sensitivity problems around the perimeter of the screen

In short I may have to go back to a film protector for this and I dont think the minor increased performance over the S6 makes the S7 worth that pain so I may return the S7 and purchase the less expensive S6

To summarize a long post if you dont care about using a screen protector or dont have a problem with the wet applyfilm type protectors then the S7 is fine  If you have gotten used to the superior protection and usability of glass protectors like me then the S7 is a disappointment I am learning all of the options I have little by little  I did not have a Smart phone before this one Talked into switching from iPhone to Galaxy and not very pleased with the Galaxy S7 Very happy with it have had a couple weeks now I bought my phone a week ago and I am still waiting to find out to trade in my old phones The Verizon dealer in Dallas Or stated Verizon would get a hold of me 
Do I need to to do something else I really dont want to go back to the S5 but will if I cant get a decent trade for the new phones Ok phone
Very temperamental Upgrade to the Samsung 7 Big upgrade over the S5 I just fired up my Samsung 7 I am glad I switched Great phone good service Cloud did not transfer all my apps but was easy to reinstall I also had to transfer all my 800 pictures into albums that had been lost Battery is awful Dont buy this phone Galaxy S7 You will regret Sprint here I come Good features of phone Great upgrade from my Galaxy S5easy transition faster camera more storage  I love it I had an S5 and upgraded it took a little while and lots of trial to get it dialed in but otherwise Im glad I did Other than below average mobile connectivity the phone is great   Had better connectivity with previous S5 and older phones from Verizon First galaxy always had Motorola  Like some features and miss some of the Motorola Droid features I bought this a week ago and so far so good Finally updated our galaxy note 2 phones  We will miss the removable batteries and stylus pen but the battery on this phone lasts all day even with heavy use and charges very fast Had it a week and  have found it does not work as good as my old S5  It hurts my head to talk on it for any length of time  Setting it to power saver seems to help a little with this  I loose calls cant hear people  They had to disable the Hidef sound feature immediately as it would truncate the sound so I couldnt hear and those I spoke to couldnt hear me  Ya the camera is better than the S5 does not hold a charge as stated in their adds The most useage time I have gotton is 10 hrs Purchased 2 Galaxy S7s a few weeks ago  Couldnt be happier with it  Voice recognition and fingerprint security features are excellent Camera takes great photos too love the lock screen showing the time love that i can get from lockscreen to camera just by pushing the bottom button twice genius Need to use more to know all features I am enjoying the size of this phone and all of the features especially the great camera I dont need to lug around my bulky SLR anymore Great phone doesnt have some of the functions I enjoyed with the note 5 It is fast and so far has a good battery life I enjoy every detail about this phone I highly recommend it This review was collected as part of a promotion I rally like the phone because I had the S5 for 2 years this format is easy to follow and I am finding Samsung has simplified a few things Have always been a Galaxy S fan the S7 continues the tradition  Its a pricy phone but the features and accessibility make it unbeatable Other than a better camera and sharper display theres not much difference between it and my old S3 Keyboard is a painyou have to HIT the space bar precisely and firmly to space words Returning it and waiting for Samsung to come out with a non incinerating Note Until then Ill keep using my Note 3 I bought this phone on black Fridayupgrading from the note 4 The 1st thing I noticed was how much clearer the pictures are Then all the options for taking pictures The next day when I finally made a phone call wow what a difference  100  improvement in clarity Charging time was also improved  I drive a truck for a livingthe same route everyday I know where the dead spots are I dont know if its the phone or the servicebut they are all gone No dropped calls with verizion I like the larger screen of the note 4 That is the only drawback which is minor on the S7 If I had the eyes of a younger man I would give the S7 5 stars Great phone overall but the call quality takes a bit to get used to  It doesnt elaminate background noises very well and sometimes has an echo sound  Otherwise the phone is great At first I had a difficult time typing on the screen  It is getting easier  There are times that I wish the screen was a little bigger but then it would probably be too bulky  I wish that battery life would be longer I dont really see a lot of big changes The battery isnt really lasting all day  No IR BLASTER What was Samsung thinking Have this a week and am loving it Glad I switched to Android easy to set up and full of features Looks and feels fantastic cons only
1 TouchWiz is still a disaster its insulting Android
2 Nearly zero optimization for palm rejection
3 No option to turn off soft key backlight
4 phone looks hot but touches hotter after a short time use
5 cannot flash custom ROM
6 stock keyboard sometimes lags I have always likes the Samsung phones but my S7 is wonderful Easy to use and fast when it comes to downloading and Internet I absolutely love the look feel and function of the Galaxy S7 The golden color choice is amazing and the new features like Always On which I customized to accent the golden color of the phone is functional and gorgeous I also like the texting function which increases the font size of the text you are composing and justifies the text to the left  away from the send button so you dont inadvertently hit send before you want to Another great feature is the ability to hit the home key twice to immediately access the camera No more missed photo opportunities due to fumbling with your phone Also the easy access to the camera does not compromise security because you only have access to the camera unless you go through the security protocol you setup Battery not what I expectedsound keeps going into silent mode I am liking my new phone have owned the phone 1 week and I am using galaxy 7 for dummies and it is A good resouce I had to downgrade to this phone and picked it because it was the closest thing to the Note 7 I love the phone overall it lacks some features the Note 7 had that I loved but I do consider the phone to be top quality Keyboard a bit funky Ive only had my s7 for 2 weeks but I would recommend it for anything The camera is super We had the phone for only a few days after buying it and it completely glitched out It would not power on for nothing We had to reboot the whole phone I have only had this phone for 2 weeks but if its anything like the S6 it will be great Upgrade phone from I4 to S7 Brought  this phone about 2 weeks ago Had an LG Phone fast and battery life is good If you like the s5 you should like the s7 Love the phone Very easy to use Really fast Just bought it but its working fine so far Good phonegood service Super fast great picture on screen does what I want it to do and more Upgraded allegedly two S5s to S7s for my wife and I The S7s are very fast things open quickly The S7 Screen is twice the resolution of S5 but seems to make many thin fonts almost unreadable so had to change fonts in settings Camera in S7 is way more responsive than S5 but lower resolution Touchscreens on S7s seem to have a life of their own miss a lot of touches and sometimes do things before being actually touched On screen keyboards are way more error prone than S5s even in side by side use I was also disappointed in the fact that the S7 does not have the Infrared port that the S5 did I used that feature with TVAudio remote apps and DSLR Camera remote apps and already miss it Kind of like when Samsung took the FM radio feature out after the S2 Last but not least S7s have a very small curve at the very edge of the screen that hinders use of any hard screen protectors Overall other than speed of processor the S5 still looks to be better in many ways and I would give the S5 a 5star where I give the S7 only 4

On the touchscreen error issue Verizon has locked out the keyboard commands that used to work on Galaxys to get to things like touchscreen adjustments I did find a touchscreen calibration app in Play store that has made the screen response tolerable but still not as reliable as my S5s are

Maybe we should wait for the S8 when Samsung gives us back the IR port and dare I say the FM radio Oh and the touchscreen checkbox for those of us that wear gloves A man can dream right Really like the new features that werent available on my note 2 Love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 Very easy transition from other android Great camera Long battery life I bought this black Friday 2016  I chose Samsung because I have a Samsung tablet and figured it would have similar features and make it easier to use It is very disappointing that Verizon has totally abandoned small android smartphones The only small phone you sell is an Apple and some of us dislike Apples products We cannot choose the phone wed actually prefer because Verizon does not bring any onto their  networks Just got and have had know issues yet this phone has too many non user friendly changes over my s4 I upgraded too the S7 from an S6  This phone is similar in many ways including the design   However the battery lasts so much longer  The camera takes crystal clear pictures even with the subject in motion    Im happy I made the change I bought a few weeks ago It is a pretty good phone however I would like to have a better rear camera The phone overall is nice Ive  had the phone for 1 week   It works well and I am happy to have the extra storage options again The high def camera is amazing Samsung pay feature make it big shot People watch when we pay with it Nice to have Just upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy 5 to a Galaxy 7 and I love everything about it Using the new phone right out of the box and enjoying the features Amazingly fast compared to my previous Galaxy 5  Still learning the new features  Battery life seems good  I do wish it had an HDMI plug I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 and so far have only noticed two things diffrent one good and one bad The good is it takes a micro SD card now which is great because I used all 32 GB in my S6 within the first 6 months of owning it The bad is the new S7 freezes up on me when I have 4 or 5 programs running and I have to wait minutes before it even lets me use the home key or to power it off and back on again The S6 would literally run twice the amount of programs and it NEVER froze up Maybe I got an S7 with programming issues and I need to get a replacement Slightly different features from s5 but Im learning Its nice to be able to look up things on the go  Changed from a basic phn  Only a week old but so far so good  Charges fast like that This is wonderful smart phone and performance is awesome Very well designed super fast and an amazing camera Easy transition from the S5  Smaller but bigger screen  Great customer service I like the phone design and features but Im amazed buy the amount of charging this phone seems to require On days where I dont even use it  the phone drains 45 battery life My previous phone went 34 days without even thinking of needing a charge Deleted emails keep returning Email folderslabels not manageable very disappointing Battery life nothing special
Fast charge is one nice feature Android base are easier for our family than other OS systems This is a great phone with good features and easy to use Does all I need it to but I do miss the ability to use it as a TV remote like I did with the Galaxy S5 Got a good deal on Black Friday Was past time for a new phone I like it alot I have had the phone for just over a month and although I really do like it there are two things Im not a huge fan of  One texting isnt as good because it rarely comes up with the word I swipe Two is the rounded screen and no adequate screen protector to curve with the screen Mine is already cracked It is the same as the galaxy s4 Do not like the camera Pretty good mostly the same as the S5 I did have Doesnt hold a charge for 24 hours  Going back to Verizon store to have checked Glad I made the upgrade Love the design of the edge version It does get very hot though which worries me I Have had my Galaxy S7 for about a week now and I love it  All around great features feel performance and look nice fast processor  Now someone needs to come up with a screen protector that works and the S7 will be perfect I have only had my new phone one week but the transition was easy and Im enjoying the new faster phone with the wireless charging capabilities So far so good I traded in my s5 for s7 Camera is better and faster Much larger memory storage Bought it a week ago Confusing  takes awhile to figure out where things are at  better than my iphone  it has expandable memory  So many more configuration possiblities Easy set up Love the features Will use camera soon Best phone with the best features available I bought it for my wife and daughter they love it Cant stop playing  games on it I am not really impressed with this phone  I had a Droid turbo before I got this Galaxy S7 It was 10 times the phone My service is worse  Cant seem to get a good volume  Its either to load and funny sounding or quiet I am loving the s7 so far I also picked up a mophie battery case for added battery life I had an s5 before so the Samsung phone switch app worked great It moved EVERYTHING for me Personal settings and all So far its been a great experience Love Verizon coverage This was an easy upgrade from my s4 Just started using phone for one week so far it is working great I purchased a month ago and happy I did I just bought my phone one week ago and am still getting used to it So far its OK People tell me I will come to rely on it completely but so far Im not there Im old school so would like a user manual to read on how to operate I dont like reading a lot off a computer screen I would also like to answer maybe to some of the questions on this survey and dont have that option It is a quite powerful phone with great features and a very good camera I bought this phone a week ago and love it I just got this phone a week ago I came from a s6 edge so I knew what I was getting into but the switch to Verizon is going to save me 50 every month Ive had this phone for 2 weeks now and I love this phone Great processor speed battery life SD card slot all the features that I love in an android phone It has a good feel in your hand fits well in your pocket but its not so thin that Im afraid of breaking it if I sit down 

Its a Samsung so theres a wide variety of accessories available from both Samsung or third party vendors  if youre into that

 Only one complaint Samsung has a lot of proprietary software that cant be uninstalled None of it so far has affected the phones performance but it does add a lot of clutter and I had to spend some time customizing it All around happy with this phone We have been disappointed with the S6 ever since we bought them the S7 has been better on every level I bought this a month ago its pretty much the same as the s5 However I feel like I have to press the buttons harder to get them to work My swipe doesnt seem to work as well either But other than that I like it I have had this phone for about 8 days and I am happy with my Galaxy s7 I love the features and ease of use of the Galaxy 7 The transition from the Galaxy 4 was simple and Im playing around with it and just enjoying my new phone Great phone and service I like the phone with the exception that it loads pages over wifi slow and seems to have some lag I can sit with both my S7 and my old HTC in the same spot and the HTC brings up pages immediately while the Samsung S7 is still trying to load them Quite frustrating and after testing the HTC at the same time its obviously not my wifi Seems faster more memory and SD card A little trouble finding a glass screen protector Waiting for Zagg to start selling theirs I bought it black Friday its a great phone Just got the phone about a week ago im enjoying the newer apps and battery life but not a whole lot different than the S4 I was using Overall I like it but not worth the price Easy to use and reliable I was very unhappy with the S6  lots of quirky little problems with it  but Ive had other Samsung Gallaxy phones so I wasnt completely disillusioned  Based on reviews of the S7 I upgraded and have been very very happy with it  Data transferred over easily So far so good Really loved how easy it was to port over all my stuff Best thing so far I purchased 2 weeks ago and am finding it very easy to use It is helping me be more efficient with activities while staying in touch with familyfriends I cant complain about the performance of the phone other than it doesnt last long enough My wife and I both have the same problem it dies faster than our old phones We both have to hit the charger on the way home or it wont last through dinner My G3 and her S5 both had about 15 more power at the end if the day 35 vs 20

Fast charging is great If your job lets you have your own charger you can plug into at will I am away from my desk most of the time And I dont know how much the fast chargers hurt the longevity of the battery Moved from S5 to S7  much better product Great phone Nice claritymy other phone was quite old but this is a sweet phone Before my transition to the S7 I had the S5 and never had any major issues with the performance of my phone except what was to come with the having it for 2 12 years I LOVED my S5 and was so set on getting the S7 and finally did and do not regret it one bit The S7 does everything the S5 did except its much faster takes amazing pictures oh and I looovveeee goooollldddd And the HD phone calls are so clear and dont have a hard time hearing people over the phone anymore So if you are a huge fan of the Galaxy S5 you will LOVE  the S7 Bought one week ago and still happy with it this was a good upgrade from our previous S4 Doesnt  always unlock Im glad I made an early upgrade Had it a week Extremely Happy with it I can hear a lot better on this phone and it gets great service Fun phon experience Ive always been a DROID fan This phone met my expectations once again Last phone was a note3 This s7 is even better The speed to the quality of pictures Love it I love it pictures  video are great I bought this product about a week ago and every time I use it Im inundated with pops and spam The Web browser chrome use of history to make suggestions has me clearing my history after every use  ANNOYING  One reason I purchased this phone was for the ability to use it as a WiFi hotspot and to use the USB tethering capability  The USB tethering is not working at all and the USB hot spot stopped working within a day after I had the Verizon store ste it up  I had to get the stores assistance as the hotspot function didnt work after I first received the phone  Our other cell phone is a Lumina 735 that I have no problems with after I upgraded to Windows 10 with the assistance of a Microsoft Store  I would have bought another windows phone if I was convinced that Microsoft was still supporting their Nokia line and if Verizon would finally make a windows 10 phone directly available I had the s5 but really hated the non removable battery on the s7 Really wish I hadnt bought this stupid phone I bought this phone a little over a week ago and am enjoying the sleekness of phone ease of moving between apps and functions One of my favorite features is the camera It takes beautiful pictures I moved up from the S4 Mini and the difference is like night and day I dont have to recharge my new phone throughout the day and it has plenty of juice left for the evenings Samsung rulesthe S7 is similar to the S5 with a few more bells and whistles but oddly enough a few less too It seems to be lacking a few personalcustom layout options but theyre minor My only complaint is the battery is not removable which worries me for future use and longevity Bought my s7 a week ago Had an s4  it was great The s7 is Awesome Love it Excellent no other comments Wish this phone came in more memory such as 64gig like the s6 Moved from the s6 to this and now i have to make less of adjustments to accommodate the lack of memory We are enjoying our phonesnot the cost mind you because we are paying almost double what we did with ATTand we are still on a learning curve trying to figure out some things Im finding my way with it quite easily and I am old and mega tech challenged this is good phone for all Previously I was not getting cell phone coverage at home  but now with Verizon I am receiving a strong cell phone signal The phone performs very well and I am completely satisfied with it I love the phone its easy to use I had the S5 for 3 years I upgraded to the S7 and couldnt be happier Good phone not real happy with the battery life I didnt give this a 5 star because it doesnt have the IR blaster feature   Some people may not miss it but I definitely do  The sleek design is great and fits easily in the purse  Everything the S5 had this phone has except for the IR blaster  Nice phone though Happy with this g7 everything I had hoped for Screen is awesome takes great photos Had a s5 upgraded to the s7 and so glad I did its double the phone I had After just a couple days the screen has several superficial scratches  Have had several different galaxy phones and never had this issue  Very disappointed Only thing is get a case phone is slippery i got this to replace my note 3i like this one better S7 is nice I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I loved it except I had very little storage space available  The system file took up  too much space The Galaxy S7 had more storage and the system files are more efficient Features are awesome great camera Im loving it
 Talked my husband into getting one Really enjoying the new phone Fast charging long battery life comfortable earbuds great display Looking forward to using it with the Gear VR This phone slips out of your hand I cant find a otter box that will work right with it the screen is super sensitive if you hit the edge it will click in other screens I came from a note 3 and this was the only upgrade option that I have for a bigger Samsung phone since we try to stay with the Samsung line They took the note 5 off the market and cant no longer get the 7 note Im truly disappointed Im thinking of taking this phone back and finding a used note 5 And this phone is slow I took the first one back because the screen does its own thing Few new features Nothing changes in looks Could had better features and camera with DSLR features Performance bit more faster expected very user friendly lightweight love the sleekness I updated from a Galaxy S5 to the S7  Visually theres not a lot of difference between the two  There are some updated features however one of my most used features the smart alarm on the clock is no longer on this phone  This is very disappointing as I used it every day theres nothing worse that waking up to a blaring alarm  I did notice that theres a feature to make the first 60 seconds louder again why would you want this  It would be great if Samsung would bring back this feature maybe with an update  Please This phone is great has a wonderful camera and the screen is nice and bright Its water resistant and has good features on the phone LOVE IT Wish I would have gotten my Galaxy 7 sooner I love the lookstyle speed and picture quality I also love that its water resistant  I had to switch from Sprint to Verizon to activate the cell on my new G2 watch The edge is a great phone its light fast powerful and has a sleek design But its not all good sometimes it slows down when you have too many app at the same time Also it can be a bit of a pain when passing the phone around when trying to show a video since it has a big screen n very little safe spots I love this phone and the camera but Im not sure what is so different from the 6 Hoping to explore and find new improved stuff This phone has been an amazing upgrade from my Galaxy S5 Waterproof is not the only great thing about it This has every feature that I look for in a device While there is no perfect option out there this is what comes the closest for me I AM A GAMER AND THIS PHONE HAS THE BEST PROCESSING SPEED FOR ALL OF MY GAMES AND SAVE FILES THE EXTERNAL SD CAPABILITY UP TO 2TB IS MAGNIFICENT Great phone with a fantastic screen Fast performance The howto videos in the help section were great in quickly figuring out the things my new phone can do So much better than my last phone as a previous apple user it does not compare to any iPhone Ive had easy to use and love all its features especially the S Health app which allows your phone to track your steps and monitor your heart rate how awesome is that I got this phone 2 months ago and i have had nothing but issues  It freezes up its gets hot  It never has internet connection  Verizon has now sent me 4 replacements phones and nothing is working  I am considering switching providers  I had my orginial phone not even a week before it started having all of these issues Havent had it for long but if things continue to go as they have so far Ill be very happy This is a great phone It works greatit holds a great charge unless you play games a lot Great phone and easy upgrade from an S4 Two brand new phones and neither one will access the network I have been using this phone for almost 6 months now and I must say that I dont think there is anything I can complain about If you are looking for a phone with the best display  camera speedwater resistanceto list a few you need not look anywhere This is all in one package and you dont have to compromize on any of the features Its worth every penny spent I am so happy with this phone that I just bought another one for my wife Normally after purchasing a phone you feel its outdated after using it for 56 months which used to happen with my earlier phones But this is not the case with Galaxy S7 It was launched in March this year and I dont think any other latest phone has any better features to boast about 

The only con about this is the software updatesnothing to do with the device I just hope that Samsung release the latest android updates sooner to its users 

Other than that I am one happy Samsung customer I own 2 samsung phones 2 gear VRs 1 tab A 97 and 1 wireless charger The Gear S3 smartwatch in my wishlist Samsung made a classy phone with nice build features and performance
Pros
Simple UI and option to customize the themes 
Waterproofing 
Performance
Camera
Charging speed and battery performance
Build quality

Cons
Not much Just it feels heavy This phone has everything you need and then some  fast  expandable  highly customizable  loud speakers  feels good and look even better in your hand 
Coming from an iOS environment it is a little overwhelming at first  took a solid day to set it up and get used to  but with a little dilagence and some web searches I was able to create a very useful  highly customizable  fun workspace 
Very easy and inexpensive to add additional memory  I recommend using the card memory to store and organize you music collection Works great Ive only had my S7 for a week and I love it  Most likely because I went from an S4 to an S7  I wanted to stay with a phone where I was familiar with the basic functions and the transition to this one was easy  It looks great and fits in my pocket well even with a protective case  I got the S7 8 days ago For it being the top phone in Consumer Reports I figured it has to be good I definitely dont love it The battery life is absolutely horrible I bought it a week ago and I really like it I just upgraded my phone This is a great phone and easy to use Well to start I got rid of my S5 and purchased the S7 Well I like some of the new things but there is some things I do not likethe S7 is very similar to the S5 in a lot of ways but the S7 has a better camera more storage space and a few other nice things Now the badI have to say I have dropped more calls with the S7 and data seems to be slower and WiFi is a lot slower Im not super happy so far but Ive only had the phone a short period of time I wouldnt recommend this phone By far the best android device that i have used Great speed great photos and overall a great product Like it so far but has only been a week Camera is awesome I have not seen the advantage to justify the price over the Samsung Galaxy 6 Bought this as a replacement to my 2 Note7s that kept getting recalled  It was smaller than Id like but I think I was just used to having a big screenno biggie 

Then within a month of owning this my audio stopped working properly  Phone calls I could hear the person and then I couldnt   Watching videos the sound would go in and out for big gaps of time  Music I couldnt even listen to just kept going off without even touching my phone  3 factory resets and lengthy calls to Samsung and Verizon tech support and they couldnt figure it out Never dropped my phone Otterbox case and never got it wet

This may have been a fluke incident but after only 3 Samsung Phones in 3 months and still having an issue I gave up on it

Kudos for Verizon for understanding frustrations and allowing me to switch to a completely different device past the 14 day window I bought 3 of these phones for my family and I We ALL LOVE this phoneTransferring info from old phone was seamless It has a lot of great features Battery  still at 30 late at night after using numerous features ALL DAY LONG I made a huge mistake taking this deal now I am stuck for 2 years with 2 of these phones after the 2 years is up TRASH Getting something different Better camera and longer lasting battery than my S5More RAM too I bought the phone a little over a week ago and Im ready to return it My company bought me one in october and i loved it so much i upgraded all my eligible lines to this phone I have owned several Motorola Droid Rzr Maxx  phones which I have been satisfied with I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 after seeing some great reviews It is a nice phone with several upgrades over a Rzr I like the wireless charging However there are also a few things I am dissatisfied with The battery life seems less than my Rzr Maxx Also the speaker is a real disappointment Screaming fast processor good amount of memory love the fact that I can install external memory Great battery life Nice big screen easy to use easy to see Built in wireless charging capability Loud speaker Both this phone three week a goneed instructions booklet I have had my s7 for a week now It has been great so far  Love all the new options I bought this a few days ago and have been very happy with it The FM radio is handy which I had missed with the Galaxy S5 Getting apps set up was easy and responsiveness is very good Battery life is also much better than the S5 and it doesnt have the clunky flap to open the USB charging slot The only problem I have encountered is that often the fingerprint scanner doesnt pick up my fingerprint swipe and I end up having to enter the password I got this phone 2 or 3 weeks ago I love it Everything has been great so far It was an easy transition from the S5 to the S7 I love the camera on the S7 it works much better Ive had the phone about 2 weeks and havent had any trouble Keys are a little touchy but I love the phone You need to bring back training classes for folks transitioning to a new phone esp when its a change in manufacturer It does the job but really is nothing special compared to other flagship phones out there I wasnt going to get a new phone yet but  am really glad I did I still go with the galaxy over an iPhone because of the option for an SD card Options are good and Samsung offers it I put pictures on the card and tons of music onto the phone Overall phone is very similar to the other S models but super upgraded camera I am pleased with the phone thus far after 2 weeks Great phone Have had very good performance of a lot of Samsung products Just bought a new 55 UN55KU6300 TV too and its awesome Great job Samsung Great quality phone with superb design Great response time when browsing page to page on any Apps The product has an amazing speakers for a phone This review was collected as part of a promotion i bought it a week ago outstanding I am now more than ever a huge fan of Samsungs Galaxy line of phones The galaxy S7 is beautiful throughout its whole A slim sleek phone LOADED with options to customize your phone the way YOU want it I love the camera capabilities and simply everything that I have found within the day I have had this phone Im extremely happy with this device Bought about 1 and 12 weeks ago Love the phone how fast it is Not happy with the selection of glass screen protectors available I bought this last month and I love it if can call on wifi and charge wordlessly Samsung have really good productsSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge is really impressive highend smartphone I like Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge so muchNo matter with the specifications and quality I love sd cards id definatly rather have a sd slot than not I take a lot of 4k videos and photosFor photographers a camera in the phone is nice to have  What a great upgrade from my trusty S3 I love the speed and ability to use more apps The camera is great my first pix are beautiful This is my first Android device and I love it The OS is so much nicer then any Ive used in the past My only issue is the phone does heat up quite a bit during charging I get slightly nervous about it with everything going on but all thats doing is making me hopeful and wanting of the new 8 next year

It out performs any device Ive used but the phone requires either a large back up battery or battery saving mode to make it through the day and thats with nearly no use Charge time is only fast while on battery saver

My biggest thing I hate is the glass back They didnt learn from apples awful 5 but again those are not the things I grade phones on Have had this phone for a week  Very easy to use lots of good features user friendly I had to settle for this since there were 2 recalls on the Note 7 I had   I loved that phone
This was 2nd choice couldnt see spending the difference on the Edge as no significant difference except size and wrap screen From one to 10 its a 10 I love it Wish I had purchased it sooner only required one phone call for setting up voice mail box wording confusing on set up Upgraded from a Galaxy s5  Considered switching to the Pixel but didnt like that the Pixel wasnt waterproof  I also like that I can get free radio on the Galaxy which is not supported currently on the Pixel  Response is nearly instantaneous  It does get very warm while using some features like the camera or apps like Snapchat filters  Also gets quite warm while charging Wish it could mirror screen with my tv or tablet Very disappointed in the battery life Use for work and have to charge each night old s5 when new would go 2 almost 3 days between charges purchased from verizon store loved the phone even though all of my contacts did not transfer i had to exchange the phone for another s7 the 4g was weak got the replacement phone and works great   great service from verizon great phone from samsung Battery charge does not last a full day even with closing apps  Motorola Droid had a much better battery life  Camera is superb This is my second Samsung phone and can only say that they are great I love the edge screen and great colors The charging system is awesome I also have the s4 active Volume button on left side keep hitting it not realizing  I hit it Not the best lay out  Love everything about the phone and it has been a very easy transition from my S4 to the S7 However the thumbprint security is extremely frustrating  It never seems to detect my print  I have recorded and saved 4 different prints of my thumb in hopes that one of them will easily unlock my phone and I still sometimes get locked out  Otherwise all else is great Everything with the phone is great except the reception  Drops calls and when talking you can only hear portions of the conversation  Sometimes the other person on the line can only hear portions of what you say  My wife and I both purchased the S7 and are experiencing the same thing  This occurs in my house  Our S4 in the house never had a problem  We do not have a home phone so our cell phones are our only means for placing and receiving calls  Plus I work from home and the only way my employer can talk to me is by my cell phone  We havent traveled since purchasing the S7 so I can not say for sure if this occurs any where else  I did activate the phone so that we can receive and place calls through WIFI  That seems to have help Ive only had this phone for 2 days and its already done more for me than my iPhone ever did No regrets here Upon my upgrade being due  I went from a Galaxy 5 to a Google PixelI learned quickly it was a mistake Thanks to Verizons 14 day return policy I was able to get the Galaxy S7 I am so happy I did it was just an upgraded faster and better version of my old Galaxy phone The rose gold color is so pretty I truly love this phone purchased 1 week ago Just got a new Galaxy S7 and love it The phone has a lot of features The camera takes amazing pictures My daughter has the same phone and we video chat Love that It has all of the bells and whistles I expected and more Ive been with Samsung since the original Galaxy While the S6 and I had this clumsy break every time you drop me relationship the S7 has been the opposite I do drop my phone and I do not recommend it ever But so far Ive been 100 lucky where with the S6 I was 100 unlucky and was getting replacement phones every time Take that for what its worth I used a Spigen case on my S6 and have an almost identical Spigen case on the S7 so go figure 

As far as this phone I love it Its fast accurate and has clear calls even with the 1 bar signal ATT seems to live in I use the edge screen a lot and find it a huge benefit but i do suspect its why i had so many breaks on the S6 but thats over love you S7 Family has had a Samsung receiver for a long time and this is my second time in a row of owning Samsung Smart phone for my wife and I After owning a Galaxy S5 for the past four years I decided to finally updated my phone to an S7 I read many reviews on both the S7 iPhone7 and the HTC10 After all my research and watching many videos on the performance of all the phones it was clear on what phone to buy the S7 Im surprised at how much faster this phone is than my S5 Games load lighting fast screen switching is fast apps load fast the Internet is fast everything is fast I couldnt be happier and if youre on the fence about what phone to choose the S7 should definitely be your choice The phone along with the other Samsung apps you can download from the Playstore work all work seamlessly and easily The only con Ive chine across is that the speaker is on the bottom of the phone I love the phone Only problem is the screen cracked after a small drop on the corner Photoso are OK not what I was expecting 
Wish it had ano option like Siri or Google assist especially while driving 
Wish it had talk to text Best Phone by Samsung yet Very easy to use and the operating system is fast I love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge  The large screen great sound quality and long battery life made the transition a smooth one Love the Samsung Galaxy s7 Im a running and run with my phone and with this phone there are no issues with water getting on the phone Bought this phone a couple weeks ago  Has been working great and the transition from my S5 to the S7 was pretty easy with the included transfer cable glad that I upgraded to S7 Features are really nice and this is agreat phone Upgraded from an old Galaxy S3 to this wonderful S7  Wow what a difference  The software interface is amazing and very functional  The phones hardware is very snappy and quick to respond  I love the fingerprint sensor to unlock from a suspended state  Very awesome phone would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from an older android smartphone I go this phone a  few days ago and so far I love it Charges fast It will take me a few to get used to it Not sure why this is considered an upgrade I like my old S5 better The S7 seems to have a connection issue with Internet My wifes S6 has better connection than me new S7 Had a s5 like the s7 Had the phones a week and all is working on well Good battery life and nice sound My last two phones have been the Galaxy S5 and S6 As much as I loved both of these phones the quality of the S7 edge is still amazing to me I am in love with the screen and notification bar Would highly recommend Had to get new phone after some coffee was spilled on mine Have had it about 3 months So far this has been a great phone Easy to operate and navigate through the various screens I have not used it with the VR I couldnt find the product page for the earphones alone so here it is The phone itself is great but the earphones that come with it are just terrible I tried with all sizes no rubber small medium medium on top of small and they just dont stay in my ears like the normal round inset earbuds Its super annoying because the cord is flat and nice but the actual earbuds are simply unusable This phone is exponentially better than the previous model S6 The battery lasts longer The style is better with its sleek design The screen is nearly inpentratrable and I love Samsung products This review was collected as part of a promotion When I chose this phone I was taking a chance because I own a Samsung Tablet that I truly enjoy When my old phone died I decided to try the Galaxy S7 It has features that I did not have on my other phone It is proving to be easier to operate than expected I have gotten a lot of compliment on its appearance I expect to continue to enjoy this phone Thanks Samsung Great Pictures I recently purchased this phone and was talked into a bundle deal including a case car charger and glass screen protector The screen protector does NOT fit this phone It doesnt adhere the the phone like it should I was lightly sliding my finger along the side that was lifting because I could see an air bubble underneath and the screen protector cracked Surprisingly the screen protector has a lifetime warranty Im already going to have to use the warranty and I havent had the phone more than two weeks Phone looks nice and has nice features but the Bluetooth disconnects very frequently Also very concerning I only have the phone a few days and it restarted randomly around 5 times so far Last is that it gets very very hot when charging just havent figured out how to get my voice mail Ive owned the S3 and the S5 couldnt pass up on the chance to get the S7 My wife and I both love them I also own a Samsung printer and 2 Galaxy Tab 2 tablets Works well just takes time to become familiar with its features Has a lot of applications I will not use This is true of all new smart devices Speedy and quick to recharge reliable phone with many upgraded features only drawback i could see is the screen lock system for security but there are 2 sides of the fence there you want great security or easy access other than that am very pleased The best phone hands down ever i recommend over iphone This review was collected as part of a promotion I love how its so simple to use yet it is really smart and sophisticated The battery life is my favorite and the waterproof add on was just the perfect way to go Definitely recommend I switched to my Galaxy s7 from a windows phone and am very pleased with the ease of transition Im totally enjoying the features and the looks The upgrade process from S5 to S7 was horrible It is WAAAAAAAAY to technical and extremely difficult to end up on an S7 at the same place same files contacts memos etc where one left off on the S5  
The device itself S7 has no obvious advantage over the S5  in fact it is smaller and typing is more difficult  
Additionally arranging the desktop is horrible unintuitive and provides too many opportunities for things to go wrong with the face of the device changing and one is left in the dark as to how to undo the last step why dont you have an Undo button
All in all my experience was so bad that i am considering returning the device and subscribing to a more reasonable plan with another carrier Love that I can insert my own SD card  Great camera and features  Easy transition from Galaxy 5 Telephone is verygood Screen is extremely clear and I love the wireless charging Purchased an iPhone 6S via an upgrade three weeks ago after having been a Galaxy Girl Wasnt really thrilled but the hype pushed me to try it Didnt work out so retVurned it at day 9 for the GS 7  After all the reviews thought I now had a gem  NOT     This phone lags photos are grainyback button has to be pressed more than once to get it going the home button feels cheap and the gold framing moves and slides from one side to the other leaving a space between the button and the framing I am a senior and handle this thing with kid gloves so why is it making me feel Samsung is being careless and throwing these new phones together so fast to suck us in I would rather still use my GS 4 plastic and all if only my dog didnt knock it out of my hand and it landed in the sink full of water It was the best phone of all Stable fast and beautiful photos I am very disappointed  
If it were possible I would return it in a minute but now that time ran out Im stuck  Going to try to find a GS 4 in great condition  I just received the GS7 and I love it its the best phone on the market So this is not my first Galaxy phone my first was the GS3 At the time it was the best phone on the market and I truly enjoyed it

Since the GS3 Ive had a few androids and one iphone and I am glad to be back the the Galaxy line All you have to do is try this phone and you will love it So far so good Only been a couple weeks This is a great phone It has a clear picture and is very fast Its so simple to use and has a ton of great apps And swype text is so great Just purchased product and seems great so far Upgrading from an S5 so waiting to see performancefeature difference Glad I made the switch  newer quicker similar I  really the look of the phone and has good battery life Very unhappy with the product that quality sold to me with my phone with the phone  Ive been having static and calls not being heard  LOVE this phone and all of its capabilities I use this and my Samsung S2 tablet and hardly have a need for a laptop any longer 
Beautiful screens lightweight and excellent software and support The samsung galaxy S7 nails just about everything  build looks and after all expanadable memory I have had Verizon for years and this junk galaxy S7 for about 6 months On my 4th one cause of not chargingover heating and battery life sucks Been trying to get out of this and back to an iphone Verizon refuses to to have good customer service and let me trade this phone I am completely dissatisfied with after all the years I have been with them Thinking its time to switch to a carrier that actually cates about their customers Samsung continuously impresses me with their technology Havent had a Samsung product yet that I could complain about I had an S3 for years I loved it I used it until it had no use left Now I purchased the S7 Wow what a difference I am still playing around with it and trying to learn it It has tons of great features and is fastfastfast does way more than I really need talk text gps email too bad the battery life is short One of the reviews I read indicated that it was scratch resistant My 15 lb dog jumped on it and now it is badly scratched I would not characterize this phone as scratch resistant and one of the reasons I bought it was that it was scratch and water resistant I had had my Galaxy note 2 for five yearsalways faithful  but some lacking points  so am very happy with this new phonebright clearer  AMAZING PHOTO DETAILS AMAZING Previous phone was a Galaxy s5 excellent phone which I didnt want to change but found it necessary to do so So glad I did The s7 is even better than the s5  sleek in design easy to handle and very intuitive to use Great phone overall great features and display Battery life could be a bit better but no phone out there should cost so much  Loving the phone so far Battery life is good volume is good even in a lifeproof case Above and beyond what I expected out of the phone I have had it for about a week and am getting the hang of it  I switched from a windows phone and its a little different But the more I get used to it the better I like it The sound is better than my windows phone and the camera is great Im happy that I went with the galaxy s7 that any other device I have used many Samsungs cell phones such as Galaxy S2 Note4 and S6
This one is the best that Ive ever used Excellet performance and features I bought this phone about a week ago and love it I just bought this phone and Im very happy with it I think my husband is jealous that he didnt get this one instead of the one he got I cant wait to see all of the other features as I go Ive already been impressed by the little things I find out just using it day 2 day Best phone ever owned  Phone is solidly built  BMW of Android phones I have had this phone little over a week I absolutely love it I have had no problems and have really liked the S7 so far  I like Samsung and quality I get with the Galaxy phones I not only switched carriers recently I also switched phones My old phone the LG G4 was horrible and draining the battery Part of that being is that Facebook came preloaded on my phone with no way of taking it off My new phone doesnt come with FB on it and thus my battery is lasting that much longer The phone is light Its beautiful And its exactly what I wanted Ive had the G S 7 a bit more than a week and its been good  Transfer done by Verizon store was OK and I was able to complete the transfer of all my files within the next two days myself including the transfer of all of my apps Attractive design  very good processor and RAM gives the enduse a lightening fast experience 
The SD card slot and dust water protection are additional compliments that makes this one the BEST choice nobrainer   GO GET IT 

Note Have been using this phone for last 8 months  still the best  Very sleek fast and easy to use right out of the box The S7 phone is a major upgrade from my old smart phone the Sales person said  purchasing you dont have upgrade every year to a new phone This is very important to me I plan on using this phone for a long time Looking forward learning more about my phone and working with you in the future This review was collected as part of a promotion We had the Samsung Galaxy S5 and were very happy with them When it came time to decide whether or not to upgrade we looked around at options We decided on the GS7 for a couple of reasons 

The new HD cameras were a huge seller These are stronger than the old 8mp camera in the GS5 We are very happy that they are again waterproof That is huge when you have an outdoor lifestyle You never know what type of weather you may encounter or where that next perfect photo might be The other big seller for us is the expandable memory That was the final determining factor in our decision Being able to install a microsd card for expanded memory and storage is fantastic

The only negative I have is that it is slightly smaller than the GS5 in size All other improvements are wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone shopping for a new phone This review was collected as part of a promotion I have the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge I love it because Im able to do any thing with it This phone is absolutely amazing Very easy to use I love it My phone is awesome I have had it a week Works the same as my S5 Gets extremely hot with any update Therefore needs to be left off at 15 minutes after any update to cool down Quick phone easy to use charges quickly and holds a charge well I love all the features size and ease of use I own many samsung products from tvs to refrigerator All are extremely well made and dependable I just bought the Galaxy S7 and I am very happy with its performance I am learning more each day Screen breaks far too easily which has cost me almost as much as the phone itself Less than a three ft drop both times broke a supposedly tough screen After a few weeks phone gets bogged down quite easily which is very frustrating Very attractive design and visually appealing its by far the prettiest thing Ive ever broken twice This phone is really easy to use Love all the features it has I had it for 1 week and can not imagine having any other phone This product has great features Design is sleek and easy to navagate Switched from a rather old Blackberry phone because I wanted to be able to use all the aps available  To get a fully phone experience  I got it in the S7  Love it My trust SIII finally croaked after four years of daily usage and abuse prompting me to finally upgrade my phone to Samsungs newest offering Im quite pleased with it the interface is just as intuitive as my previous phone my preferred apps all work with the new phone and the battery easily lasts me two days or more Great storage space very nice camera good sound quality and phone calls have been satisfactory All in all very pleased with the device and looking forward to trying to best the SIIIs four year run Brand new to Samsung phone still learning the nuances of the operating features Since I have bought this I love it The battery life is great can go for days in standby and even lasts all day when using a lot of apps I am enjoying this phone however the battery staying charged is not the best  Also the voice command does not always work I basically just got the phone and they turned it on and everything was there I did not have to do much to personalize All of my features switched over from my s4 Also the camera is great I bought the smartphone 8 days ago Gradually becoming familiar with the applications on it I like the Pandora application good selection of music to listen to Had the phone a week Wont hold a charge  Almost exactly the same as my old phone  Not impressed Had a samsung galaxy s3 before This phone is way ahead of the old phone Its just a learning curve at this pointless Little pricey but overall a good phone Great highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 My live and my bussiness are different now and become nice and very easy with Samsung Galaxy S7 The phone appears ok but most of the preloaded apps stink The contact manager wants me to share my camera to edit my contacts Really many of the other preloaded apps are like that wanting me to share information etc that they dont needed to run Who needs big brother when you have big corporate watching everything you do This was a nice step up from the S6 I am glad they brought back the waterproof design And a much bigger battery The camera is excellent as well Keep up the good work Easy to hold very lightweight and function in areas that my other phone didnt very reliable I find that the phone gets very hot when used for prolong time either talking or playing games
The content from my previous phone did not all transfer over as I was told it would  I was told I could put my memory chip in this phone and cant I had a Lumia Icon which I dropped and smashed the screen I loved the Windows 10 user interface but not the lack of apps I dont like iPhones but do like the iPhone 5SE for its size I picked the Galaxy S7 because it had all the features I like I especially like all the apps I can download What I dont like is all the Samsung and Verizon apps and the keyboard is not as nice as the Windows phone I really like the phone though It is very responsive got this phone a little over a week ago I do like it a lot except that it doesnt stay charged very long5 to 6 hours at the most I turned on power save and it made no difference The only thing I use my phone for is calls and text messages and I dont get a lot of those This phone is great for everyday use Very easy to use and great apps This phone isnt much different than the S5 I just upgraded from but at the same time it is The screen is brighter and clearer the flash light provides a greater range and the cameras are amazing Things are easy to find and understand This phone is the reason I continue using Samsung products Would constintly overheat while charging It ended up melting the plastic case around it Not Happy with the Galaxy 7 But then again all Galaxy Products in general are having issues with catching fire or melting due to poor batteries 1st time user Easy to learn The phones a good size Decently fast processor decent camera But I literally have to charge it 3 times a day Luckily between the battery having tiny cells and coming with a fastcharger it doesnt take all that long but still incredibly frustrating Better than the s6 Battery life is impressive Great phone easy to use I went from an S6 edge to this new S7  The transition was seamless and this phone is absolutely glitch free  It loads fast  and the amoled display is the best in the business  period  Good battery life  water resistant  lots of storage  Definitely a best buy for me Hoping this  phone will work well for me I love this phone The display is clear and bright The fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone nearly instantly Battery life is good and it charges quickly when it needs charging Its also nice to have good protection against water Only 32 GB storage but I added a 64GB card so I have plenty of space for photos and everything else Great phone like it more then the apple I phone  wish the guy that gave us service at Verizon would of showed us how to use the phone a little had to figure some of it out on our own I have had a Samsung Galaxy since they first started making them I Iike the ease of use and how they remain consistent The S7 is the same Thats why I stick with Samsung The s7 has performed to my expectations thus far The only detractors to this phone are as follows The battery could use increased capacity And its dang near impossible to find a screen protector that covers the whole screen and doesnt pull away from the edges The curvy design is eye catching The battery is durable too By far the best I have ever owned This is the perfect phone to multitask and it is user friendly Samsung tech support is world class and the can help you with any problem you may possibly have when dealing with the S7

Love this phone I was forced to do the trade in and reluctantly did so After visiting the store 3 times to get this resolved from Samsung and Verizon I have been informed that the information I was given at the time of return was not accurate so I will be missing out on many dollars that was promised to me to return my Note 7 As far as the phone I have the S7 now and it does not even come close to working the same as my Note 7 and then very disgusted now that I am trapped with this phone This phone cannot do video playback The video gets choppy and breaks up Doesnt matter if its on the web browser facebook or youtube The phone just cannot do video playback Ive sent it in for factory repair and that wasnt successful Ive done all of the resets and no success Next phone will not be a Samsung product I upgraded from an S5 to the S7  Much of it is the same which I really like because it lessens the learning curve  I have to say that the camera does a fantastic job  I used it to take some scenic pics and used the HDR feature  Several of the photos looked like they could have been paintings  Ive attached one of them so you can see what Im talking about The phone seems to be just fine Several nice upgrades However I am having trouble linking the phone to verizons cloud I am also having trouble getting the phone to link with my Outlook programs Specifically Hotmail Contacts and Calendar I bought the phone 5 months ago and Im loving it Had to replace Galaxy3  Like the similarity of formats but CONTACTS is difficult to use Great product  easy to transfer apps  personal data to this product I like how fast the apps work  all the features for viewing data on this product The camera is top of the line product with all the great features It is hard to beat a 16 mega pixel camera for quality  performance Thanks to Samsung for a great product Had a Galaxy S5 that I wanted to upgrade So I bought the S7 More memory faster processor and more features I am happy with my choice Great phone

Its fast great camera good screen color plays great music and videos lightweight good battery life I think its the best S series phone ever I bought this phone this phone a few weeks ago enjoying the change in phones Replacement of same phone as I had this phone and replaced with same Phone is great Only problem I have is that some sort of sync was turned on the moment I got the phone and almost all my data for November was used Nothing about the phone has amazed me yet Fast processor Its a smart phone I upgraded a week ago and am very happy with the phone  The upgraded features make the transition from a Samsung Galaxy S5 fun
The only downside is that I wish the battery had more of an extended battery performance Nice transition from the 6 still had issues setting everything up however Great phone love Samsung The Galaxy S7 is great It is smaller a little easier to handle The phone and service is great First of all this is my second galaxy s7 I had the first for a week and then it crashed on me I had to spend nearly anew hour waiting for a new phone  Not Verizons fault but my time is my money and I shouldnt have had to waste my time doing that  This phone hasnt done anything special  My Droid turbo performed the same but with a better battery  I havent noticed any improvements Yeah the camera is good but not a huge deal for me I still have apps crash randomly To me its a typical phone  I wished I wouldnt have upgraded This is such an improvement over the 6 disliked it a lot The battery although it heats up some last a day and a half with regular use The sound it crisp and the video is excellent so happy with the Samsung 7 Completely satisfied Switched for better coverage  Excellent continuity Great camera much improved in all aspects compared to my S5 I bought phone for my daughter and she loves it The picture quality and battery life has definitely been her favorite features I just upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S5  This is the best phone Ive ever had Its so easy to transfer all data contacts and settings What a dream of a phone to talk on  I can hear everything people are saying now with HD voice built in  This phone is so easy to use  I also bought the Samsung Wireless Charging Stand and I love it as well  Thank you Samsung for the most outstanding phone Ive ever owned  I will recommend it to all my friends and family The batteries will not last a day if your using it You need to shut off everything if you want it to last a day  I token it back after 3 days to be told that is not a good reason to exchange it  I cant imagine what it will be like in 2 years not happy Its okay I thought the battery would last longer but its not much different from the s5 Also my coverage has change to worse This is my 3rd Samsung phone and each one gets better but still have way to much extra stuff on phone And the s7 is slow and 2 things open is very slow I have only had it 7 days so still getting used to it I had a note7 and it feels like a tremendous downgrade compared to what I was used to Some of the features I used to use are gone Love it So easy to use love the picture quality Love the phone and deal Verizon gave me Ive had the s7 for about 2 weeks and I love it  I upgraded from an s4 and although there is a slight learning curve to some features and apps for the most part it is very similar
A lot faster though and the picture quality is great  Brighter clearer screen too  Even though theres not a lot of difference in size the screen seems so much bigger  Perhaps its just the clear picture  
The ring tones and alerts are much louder too as well as the speaker which has been moved to the bottom of the phone instead of the top This phone does everything I want it to do I came over from an iphone 6 and Im never looking back The only drawback is getting updates in a timely manner from ATT Other than that If you want top of the line this is the phone to have I love Samsung Galaxy phones Ive had all of the except for the s6 I got the s7 and it nice but it seems to be slow lags And theres a bunch I dont like about the phone And the things I do like dont other out weigh the bad After this phonew looking for a new brand of phone Camera takes excellent pictures Enjoying the features Love it amazing price and product I had the Galaxy Note 7 but had to turn it in So I got the S7 Didnt want it and I dont like it doesnt seem to hold WiFi reception as good as my Note 7 I cannot assign ringtones even though I save them everybody has the same ringtone  Has no S Pen which I have relied on because I was a note person for years  Nothing really impressive about this phone at all How do you expect me to give a good review when I was forced into taking a phone I really didnt want Except for the glitch where I realized I want getting any voicemail notification I love it every bit as much as my S6 and my S3 before that I love the phone and the transfer of files and apps from my Galaxy S5 was easy and worked excellently  The transition was the easiest that I have ever experienced using  Samsungs file transfer system I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and am extremely pleased I upgraded from a Note II and have seen a significant improvement in the overall performance I love my Samsung S7 Edge it performs wonderfully and operated smoothly compared to my s4 and s5 but lately my S7 Edge has been getting hotter than normal on wireless charge and on rapid charger it gets a little hotter then the wireless charge my wife has the same phone and hers is fine on both not sure if i should be concerned Upgraded a week ago and like ease of use speed storage we bought 2 phones beginning of Oct and are very happy with them I bought this phone because my LG G3 died the month it was paidoff two years  Thought it was battery way it quit  But tried replacement and phone just had froze and died  Didnt have a choice needed a replacement cellphone and got what CNET had best review on  I like the home screen button not so impressed with camera Im so glad that my husband chose the S7 as his first smart phone All of the Galaxy phones are very similar so where he had played on my Note 5 and S3 he hasnt had much trouble at all So thankful he likes it It seems to be faster than my Samsung 6 The screen is more colorful and the camera is clearer than before I enjoy my phone I have been a Samsung phones for close to 5 years and I have nothing but good things to say about each phone I have purchased I really like all the cool features  How light weight it is  I changed over from Apple and Im very happy Only negative is battery dies easily with use The battery sucks The icons are huge The camera is grainy Bad phone all around Got it for my wife as an upgrade from S5 She loves it Happy wife Happy  Id rather have my note 7 back Samsung delivers another superior product
Its easy navigate through apps 
I love all the great features A lot to learn for a firsttime smart phone But I wanted the best       Run fast and is handy for the job I have Waterproof so can hold any type of weather This is a good model phone But the Note 7 Edge was so much more better What a shame I couldnt keep it I truly loved the USBC charging system Completely changed all my wireless products to USBC charging Now with the S7 Edge I am forced to revert backwards depressing and dissatisfied with this aspect of the phone Other than that I find it quit user friendly and feature rich just as the note 7 was The camera and its features are awesome Edge is something that you have to get use to using But I think its something that can be beneficial once I train Myself to use it more Sort of unique but really unnecessary All the same info is on the main screens and easily accessible Nevertheless all in all its a very nice phone I was tired of constantly having to adjust the memory on my old Galaxy 5 This one is compact with double the storage and speed Forced to get this s7 because of the recalled note 7 I dislike it so much the look and feel and smaller screen and battery life Nope not happy at all This phone is easy to use and works great so far I wish I had a note7 Love love love this galaxy s7 Way better display camera functionso and all around better than the previous galaxies Ive had s4 through s7 and this is by far the best yet To go from the Note after 4  years I made the switch to a S7 edge with hesitation I find the screen is as noticeable big as my previous Notes with the S7 being much easier to handle with one hand The screen is noticeably clearer which I would expect with the evolution of mobile devices but I will say it is excellent As I would expect the reviews were spot on This is a 5 product as is reflected in the price Best phone Ive ever had enjoying it like crazy Its a galaxy need I say more I had a Galaxy Note 4 before I switched to my S7 I love my S7 It was a super easy transition Love the phone love the set up The only thing Im having to really adjust to is the size It is significantly smaller than my Note 4 was But its definitely nice It fits in my pocket now  have NO idea how to use it fully or even basically   
sad face G8 b8 m8 r8 88
Its a pretty good phone unfortunately not 4k screen but hopefully hey maybe in the 8 Samsung 
But overall pleased with this The 1st time I have owned something like this I believe it will do everything I need It would certainly help me if I could find a User Manual on the Internet Thanks to be honest I have not activated it Love how smoothly this phone runs I upgraded from the s4 to the s7 and love the improvements Just upgraded to this phone from a Maxx and Im so happy I switched to Samsung I loved my Droid but all the options for customization for this phone are fantastic My only regret is that I really wish I could have gotten this phone in blue And the battery isnt lasting as long as I hoped but thats probably because I cant get off of this thing Best decision I have ever made was getting my galaxy S7 One of the best phone Beauty in your hand with loads of features especially external memory card Ive had this phone a little over a week now Had a iPhone before about the last 5 years And upgrading to a galexy was scary but the sales lady helped a lot and its been easy Nice phone Good camera Expandable memory Good price I understand upgrades but why change the simplest things You have to relearn your own phone and I find it a pain in the butt S7 is great just accept this review Petty happy with new S7 except placement of power onoff button Why was it moved down On my S5 the button was higher up the phone and never a problem On the S7 its now lower on the phone the button is where you might comfortably grip the phone so now Im occasionally turning it off Sometimes a pain to turn back on swipe code and resume whatever I was doing I received this phone a few weeks ago I love that I can toggle back and forth between multiple apps with ease Easy to navigate and its so fun costumize My phone is my life I travel a lot and it keeps me in touch Ive had the iPhone 6 and LG and Droid nothing beat this phone I received this phone as a replacement for my Note5 I was disappointed to not have a stylus and the size is smaller However it performs as good as my other Samsung Galaxy phones Purchased phone two weeks ago Really like it I like my Samsung Note  better the Galaxy 7 just doesnt compare in my opinion I also like my iPhone 7 Plus better Switched over from Sprint and the phone and service from Verizon go great together Just switched from ATT and Tmobile and am thrilled Great price and works great Love the Samsung product and my son has the Edge and is very happy with it too Love everything about this phone Features are great Very easy to operate I bought it cant say Im really happy with it Very similar to S5 very easy transition Have had new device for a week Not an easy transition I dont think its very user friendly Overall I love my phone and its perfect for what I want to do with it The edge adds extra features to it and it feels I never have an edge to the phone This review was collected as part of a promotion Volume is terrible Even on speakerphone extremely low I had an S4 previously
and the volume and speaker was much louder Very hard  to set up Upgraded from S5 to S7
I loved my S5 for the 2 years I used it but it was time to upgrade
Couldnt be more happy with the S7 I dont know what they did to make it possible but its a power saving monster It sips power rather than gulping like the S5 did 
Its fast I like the new features Overall its a great great phone I am a loyal Droid owner for years  Always loved them  Upgraded from the S5 to the S7 Everything about the phone is perfectly fine except the durability My phone cracked within 24 hours of purchasing  My husband went about 3 weeks and his cracked also  Do not buy this phone without a sturdy case  Im very disappointed in how fragile this phone is  For how expensive these phones are they should be more durable Im loyal to the Galaxy S and my wife deserve the S7 Samsung proof that they are on the top I been using Samsung products since 1999 Im loyal to the Galaxy S series but not to the S6 Samsung proof that they are on the top I been using Samsung products since 1999 On my S4I could write into an app then either email text or messenger it to people The S7 does not allow me to use this function with messenger anymore Other than that it is a clear upgrade over my old phone It fits nicely in your hand not too small and not too large takes great pictures This phone is very fast opening and closing apps And use of the internet Feels like a very sturdy phone and waterproof Great phone easy use I have had my phone for a little more than one week  This is my first smart phone  I transitioned from a slider type phone  The Galaxy S7 is very user friendly with a great battery life I had an iPhone for 4 years and decided to try out android The galaxy s7 was anice excellent choice I love this phone After trying just about every brand on the market I think I will stick with Samsung from here out The S7 has been a great phone so far and recommend it to anyone looking for a solid phone I went to the S7 Edge after having the note 7 recalled While I did really like my note the S7 Edge is as close as you can get to it even without the stylus Having the expansion slot is a big plus over the Note 5 I have had the phone for a couple of weeks and it takes a bit of getting used to but it works well The screen is a bit sensitive to the touch but there are some nice easy features once you learn them Ok Google is a great feature I truly enjoy the sleek design of the phone and the smooth operation I have had the phone almost a month and I am ready to trade it for something else  I have dropped more calls with this phone than I ever did with any of my old phones  I am very disappointed in this phone I love Samsung but definitely not the Samsung Galaxy S7 I am loving my phone so far and still exploring all the new features I ordered it online as a One Up from my Samsung Galaxy S6 It was super easy to do inexpensive and the staff was very helpful and friendly The transfer from my old phone to the Samsung Galaxy S7 was seamless and I feel like I didnt miss a thing I love the camera on the S7  its much better than any previous versions of the Galaxy that Ive had I really like that they kept a great style and resolution on the phone The audio is great especially with headphones in I use my phone for everything Email camera music Instagram it does everything I need it to without any problems The phone is OK but so far nothing special than what you would expect for the money Like the phone Love the clarity of the camera However I seem to always touch the side letters on the keyboard with my palm which is annoying Works great  still learning features Great phone Easy to use Got it on Halloween  Love it I have had this samsung for about 6 months and I hate it it over heats when charging and when its not on the charger it still over heats Also it backs out in apps that you are using I will never get a Samsung Galaxy 7s again This phone has many new features that my S4 did not
Ive had it for only 1 week so I dont know everything it can do yet but I really like it plus its very pretty  I got the gold There was much confusion to the TRUTH about battery life with Samsung Galaxy 7 I was told it was much better than s4 Not true I have to charge it daily Also often now I have been using keyboard to write an email and my phone will suddenly shut off  I could not find the normal voice mailand it is confusing that there is also a Verizon one that costs extraI cant get rid of it I do like the camera All said I have had my phone for just a week and am not totally used to it yet Love my edge Works great display is nice customizable Loveeeee it Upgraded to the S7 because my S5 stopped charging Overall the S7 has been great It operates quicker and has a nice sleek design  recommend getting a cover with some grip its slippery without one Camera takes sharper pics and the clarity of phone calls seems to be drastically improved My only complaint is that the keyboard is really sensitive so it took some getting used to  using 1 hand to swypetext is not as easy to accomplish Got better once I got a grippy cover Great screen size and the internals are what stun  We have 4 gigs of RAM which allows greater multitasking 820 processing power and an on board gaming card  Love it This is the second Samsung phone I have owned and I will never change My new s7 got thrown in the washer and covered up in three foot of dirt It still works The Life Proof case is the only way to go This review was collected as part of a promotion Its missing a lot of the features that my s5 mini had that I loved if I had it my way I would go back to using the mini dont really like this phone I put 5 stars for most everything 4 stars for the phone being a bit smooth maybe too smooth I chose to add an armoredtextured cover I ve had the phone 1 week As time goes by Ill learn how to remove some power eating functions I believe because at the moment the battery just lasts a day of easy use But I often find systems on and running and I was not conscious of their activity

The phone is fast and as advertised takes BRILLIANT photos 
I also enjoy having a large amount of gigs for storage thats great To start off this phone was purchased as a replacement for the Galaxy NOTE 7 I had However since they recalled it is figured Id get this phone instead because it was the next big thing Im surprised that I actually like this phone better than the Galaxy Note 7 Im not sure it it was because I had the blue note 7  I got a black 7 edge But Im glad that I like it better The camera is phenomenal I loveeee that it has a flash in the front facing camera The phone quality is absolutely excellent I also love the battery life on this phone It is practically in my hand almost every second and after I put it down it is no less than 50 If you are considering to buy this phone stop thinking about it and get it It really is the best phone out right now I cant wait to see what samsung has in store for me on my next upgrade Happy with my Samsung S7 I LOVE ALLL THERE PHONES IM SORRY THERE PHONE AND EVERYTHING DAY HAVE I LOVE IT This review was collected as part of a promotion seems ok so far  not sure that it is much better than my old S4 except for the camera I like the large screen  The pictures are good quality  My difficulty is finding things as they are a bit different than the Droid I had previous to this phone Have used Samsung phones for years and got a crazy moment in a Verizon Store and bought a Droidstuck with it for two years Only because couldnt switch till two years 
This time went back to Samsung and no major problems so far
Battery gets really hot when using with the VR headset but not too bad in a Otterbox cover I love the phone good size it has everything I need and more I only bought it a week ago Still settting it up It is very responsive The screen is clear and detailed The camera produced beautiful pictures Has me really excited for whats in store for the S8 It has a small screen and runs kind of slow I started out as an iPhone guy mom stood in line for hours and hours first time I bought one Then I worked with a guy all day long inside the cab of a truck and he had a Galaxy and I was able to compare the two in great detail and the Samsung hands down dominated over the iPhone I was able to do more and enjoyed the features on the Samsung so much more What I like most about this product is the way I can get information with easy The secure feature using my thumb print the excellent camera most of all looking at movies any where I go A little different than my Galaxy S4 so it took a few days to get used to  But very nice operation very clear screen and a nice camera Great phone However it drops my calls frequently My galaxy 4 never did Living same place Also do not like that the speaker is in the bottom of the phone otherwise a great phone I like the phone but not the screen protector Doesnt cover the whole screen Purchased phone two months ago Great product Certain a step up from my old Galaxy S4 Mini  I keep my phones as long as possible if even they are 23 years behind the most current model This phone is sick  I bought this a week ago I really would have preferred another galaxy note but none were available The s7 is much smaller harder to see and size makes more difficult to use key board Not thrilled with it This is my s7 story I had a cookout last weekend The table i had laid my phone on was blown over when the wind picked up My phone has a morphie power pack as well causing it to land face up I searched for the phone for three days before finding it in standing water I have just spilled water on other phones from a glass knocked over at the table  fry the phone This phone  power pack lay in the elements for three days and it rained one of the days and the phone was wet in water when I found it I shook it off dried it plugged it in  no problems If you are like me and can destroy anything this is the phone for you
 Happy with the lesser number of useless apps compared to att Unhappy with the lack of ability to turn off of certain apps the curved screen and the inability to have a tempered glass screen protector and the unreactive keyboard screen that is related to the screen protector the sales pertain took upon themselves to add and put in my phone without asking Got the phone for my wife and she loving it Love the new Samsung Galaxy S7 except that the bluetooth doesnt work When i scan for devices it doesnt pick up a single device Pretty upsetting because I use bluetooth headphones all the time There is no difference between galaxy s6 edge and s7 performance wise I had the galaxy s4 also and the s7 is only screen that cracked which happened in less then a week of buying the phone The drop was only 2 feet also Terrible quality probably the last Samsung device I buy I bought this phone one week ago So far I am loving it The camera is amazing It is so fast as well I am very happy I bought  this phone and it was so hard to part with my Note 2 which was old but it was the best decision  I made I love my new phone Great phones easy transition from my galaxy s5 Best phone yet very happy Excellent premium smart phone Well built and runs very smoothly it could be a bit cheaper but well worth the price Probably the best android phone in the market well I bought it couple days ago think I am going to have to send for different one every time I  go to  different page it flips back to  previous like I hit back button I purchased this phone just two weeks ago  I am very happy with the design and the features that are on this phone  I overall love it I have had this phone for a few weeks and love everything about it  The transition from my galaxy s5 was so simple and everything was transferred right over  I didnt have to set up anything  My favorite feature is the camera  This phone takes amazing picture from both sides of the phone  I love that this phone isnt any bigger than the s5  I dont have anything bad to say about this phone so far This is a great phone easy to use more capabilities than imaginable Very happy with my new phone Samsung Galaxy s7 Nice Similar to my S4 Brighter colors but be very careful with it until you get a cover for it Its VERY slippery I hear an echo every time on phone bad reception and signal for data and calls Battery life is mediocre The phone is a great upgrade from the S5 I had The camera takes pictures quicker that was my biggest problem with the S5 I used a Galaxy 7 for a short time as a loaner phone What a difference over my Galaxy 5 Much faster for everything related to texting or email Great sound as well Im so glad that we made the decision to leave Sprint and go to Verizon The coverage is better and the phone is amazing Camera works great and I love the always on screen  Battery lasts much longer than my LG G4 did Had it about two weeks  I like the nice bright screen  Emails load better than my earlier Galaxy Have had this for over a month and I am very pleased with phone Nice features the battery life isnt as long as I would prefer Very nice styling and love the water resistant feature Easy to use Great phone fast reliable Really good features I bought my phone last week and I love it easy to use and it takes great pictures I upgraded from an S5 to an S7 With minor exceptions this iteration is a nice improvement Not happy  I gently set my brand new phone on my desk had less than 24 hours and it spider cracked on the back  The retailer wouldnt replace without insurance  I was blamed for a manufacturer defect  I have worked in glass in my career and this spider crack was clearly the result of a defect  Samsung customer support was bad  Other than the above issues it is a good phone Fast  Easy transition from my old Android  The screen is so crisp even old eyes can see well  The always on display is handy and the battery consumption very reasonable at the age of 72 this is my first smart phone and I am having so much fun with it  the miracles of modern innovation keep surprising me This review was collected as part of a promotion The picture quality is my favorite thing about this phone Although Ive some issues with it freezing the overall quality of the phone has been good Like the phone  love the camera  a little too pushy with notifications and such but overall a great phone I just bought this phone about two weeks ago I LOVE IT I have  upgraded  from a Galaxy 4 this phone does so much more Much better battery  better camera which takes great pictures in  low light as advertised Faster processor Love the HD and WiFi calling features in my workplace I have a very low mobile signal and so this feature helps me now to receive all of my  calls and talk to 
people clearly I wish that I had upgraded sooner Best replacement for the Note7 Unfortunately I couldnt keep my Note7 but this is a great alternative I used galaxy s7 10month so far no slowing down 
Still fast and no battery problem  Ive had them all and the Samsung 7 edge wins hands down without even coming close the camera has so many features I dont think one could ever use them all but its nice to have them available and the features are great also and where I live low signal area this is the only phone that would even come close to workout without any problems at all and I tried them all Samsung always did better and offers more than any cellphone on the market its a shame that I had the 4 and it got broken the frist phone ever in 15 years and they couldnt replace it and it was the best phone by far but it was discontinued almost as fast as it was available the insurance could take replace it nor could Verizon and I like the bigger size of it and yet they discontinued it the same year it was offered to bad that was the best High quality construction and smooth fast performance I wish the battery life was better but with all thats going on with this phone i understand the battery life Great phone overall This is a great phone It can doo all you want and more There is no better Youd think it would be easy to just go up a few levelsHA My pictures are all over the place taken out of their previous albums thanks Google theres a known and annoying flaw in the Samsung keyboard if you dont use Gmail the S7 is a tiny bit bigger than the S4 requiring a new case And Ive only had this for a week who knows what other issues will come up If I could have exoandrd memory in S4 would have been happy to keep it I love my phone with the exception of the alarm My S4 would let me swipe left to snooze and swipe right to cancel  The alarm on the S7 has a tiny button to push to snooze and the big red slide to cancel  Its taking alot to get use to that feature  Other than that the phone is great It charges really fast and I love how quick everything is I purchased a galaxy S7 phone on 81116Worked fine up until mid OctoberPhone finally locked up and was uselessWent to ATT storethey tried to get it fixed No luckSent me to ATT DSC centerThey tried to reboot or reflash itAlso went thru 3 sim cards No luckFinally gave me a new refurbished phoneMy last phone was a galaxy s3Becoming disatisfied with Samsung products Love the way it fits perfectly in my hand Love the features I purchased the galaxy 7 because the note 7 was discontinued  I wanted the s7 edge but they did not have them I liked the not 7 I dont like the s7 Should have gotten the new iphone Not happy Best yet  I am happy to own an S7 and like to show it off to my friends After having it for a month there are a few times it can have slowdown issues but mostly its fine after a quick restart I like the design and it the features arent too shabby either Only issue as with most phones is the cost to pay for it This one is pretty good all things considered for its value This product has great features Productive to use I have had this phone for 2 weeks and I love it I have always been a fan of the Galaxy model so perhaps Im biased but I dont have any complaints Seemed like a downgrade from the Note7 but man this phone rocks Im glad I stuck with my Samsung family Note8 should be great Looking forward to it Had note 7 twice had no problems with them If the 7edge had a pen it would people perfect I received my S7 Edge as part of the Note 7 recall program I have found it to be a very poor substitute for the Note 7 It really doesnt perform better than my S7 and definitely doesnt perform for my business like the Note 7 did the Note 7 especially the second issue of the Note 7 ran way cooler than either my S7 or the S7 Edge My S7 is still my go to phone and I feel that my money was wasted on the Edge I am very disappointed Ive had it 3 weeks and I love it  Its fast has great features This is my favorite phone to date Im so happy I purchased it I am enjoying the Go Google feature  So far I am learning to use all the features and understand why kids are so devoted to this technology I bought this a few weeks ago and its not grade from the Galaxy 5 I like it a lot but I wish it had even more internal memory on it because after moving all my stuff over it took up a lot of the memory already It also feels hot when I use it for more than 1015 minutes which makes me worry about the battery I bought this 2 weeks ago after returning my Pixel The images in Pixel are poor compared to the S7 Pictures taken in low light were grainy Zoom is very limited could only zoom to half of screen size vs S7 which is full screen and more Just got back from WY and the S7 pics are all amazing It has so many options to adjust for any light level Easy to use The phone is fantastic I have an S5 before this My only regret is that the camera had 16mp like my S5 not 12mp 
I am so glad to have returned the Pixel Samsung has done it again Bought this 2 weeks ago was an easy transfer from my s5 But is you are switching from apple it will take you a while to get use to it Bought it when I switched to Verizon 2 weeks ago Battery life is terrible doesnt get good reception everything just seems slower  way worse than the S6 I had with att I prefer my S5 over this phone Options  settings are not as good anymore You cant group emails by date adjust keyboard sensitivity in call popup is gone  sound clips are different to name a few The only upgraded feature is the camera  the space Ive had it a month and frequently put calls on mute because of the location of the mute  symbol Thats really all I dont like Battery life not as good as the S5 I was a little hesitant about going from a Note 4 to a smaller Galaxy S7 Im glad I did it because I love it Easy to text with one hand its cuter The only thing I miss is the S pen but the pros definitely outweigh the cons I switched from LG4 back to Samsung   Better quality product   LG died after 1 year Its a smart phone it does what it needs to and more great features and for the most part it is snappy and fast I have had some problems with certain games with them being slow I blame the game company not the phone but just wanted to let people know Everything about this product the features the weekly details that u receive on your device the ease to use everything is top notch I had the 6edge plus before this phone and I would say it is 5 as well Just got it and I enjoy it so much I bought this phone less than two weeks ago It works fine I do lose my play lists in the Amazon media player when I restart the phone 

I did have trouble with ordering I went online to order for in store pickup The order got stuck in the system Five hours later I had to visit the store to get the order released Very frustrating

I took the phone home to activate it I live in a dead zone I was told by an employee that only a good WiFi signal was needed to activate That is wrong I had to return to the store to get it activated Very frustrating 

The in store manager was helpful professional and great help She made sure I walked away completely satisfied 

The lesson I learned was ALWAYS activate at the store Im used to the Samsung Note line of phones Im used to the bigger phones with more features Trying to get used to this phone and functions But quiet not satisfied with the s7 Love the phone tons of features still discovering them I got the 7 Note for my husband for his job he loved it Then it got recalled and had to switch phones we got him the S7 he does not like it at all It takes forever for anything to load update or connect to any thing Upgraded from S5 and love the new speed Im in love with my phone I feel like I can rule the world with it I received a broken screen phone Verizon will not take back I waited for the note 7 after recall and still received a phone that the battery heated up The only choice I had was a Samsung s7 The s7 is a lot smaller than note 4 and 7 I missed 5 voice mails because I cant called them up or even find them as easily as on the 5it often switches screens randomly when Im in the middle of somethin I like the phone and all of its features it has with it The only problem is that I am now on my second replacement of the phone because my original and the first replacement phone had problems overheating There was no warning about why the battery was overheating I use the white Samsung charging cable with the wall adapter to charge my phone The new phone that I got from Verizon yesterday starting to over heat while I was setting the phone up I am not sure what is going on with the Galaxy S 7s but The batter shouldnt over heat for no reason I was told that it might have been due to an app I had on my phone and I uninstalled the app And Still had trouble with the battery heating up easy transition from old phone love the features Very happy  The Smart Switch feature was AWESOME I bought this Samsung Galaxy 7 and I am very satisfied The phone performs great Easy to use and set up I recently upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy 4 and I really am not impressed with the upgrades I think we are being stifled in buying the latest edition and I truly dont think what they are coming out with are innovations I have had my Galaxy S7 for about a week and love the features  I just wish Verizon Network Coverage would allow me to use the phone when I dont
have WiFi Love phone themes Also like the ability to respond to texts in other apps Bought a new Galaxy S7 about a week ago Easy transaction at Verizon store Hartsdale NY quick setup phone is user friendly Far superior in every way to my previous service provider Sprint A good phone The phones waterproof feature is sweet The biggest downside is the speaker is tiny and weak Get a Bluetooth speaker if your going to listen without the headset The only problem I am having with my new Galaxy S7 is that the signal strength is sooo much weaker than my old Galaxy S4 and is slower to perform tasks FB videos rarely play even at 4 bars  PLEASE FIX
Thank you This phone doesnt do a lot of things my Droid did or at least not as easily The svoice is not as intuitive Cannot find a way to have the phone read text messages aloud when I am driving like my Droid did Phone is fast the camera is terrific and I like the way voicemail shows up but the phone  doesnt  allow people to be put on home screen for quick  access The many phone personizattuon features provide lots of unusual options for specific situations that could be helpful Very glad I upgraded So much more to be able to do on it Old phone was stolen  Galaxy S7 was very easy to learn the new features  Sales rep was a great help when I could not find the feature options in the old locations I loved the note 7  The screen on the s7 is too small Sooo much better then an iphone haha Upgraded from the S3 last week and so far its great Its a huge improvement but I am coming from a very old phone Its a lot faster the battery life is good and the camera is amazing Love the Galaxy phones but this new S7 keyboard cant keep up with my typing  Never had this problem with my S5 Recently upgraded from a Galaxy 5 to the 7 Although they are similar it seems they have improved speed and quality I like the exterior design a lot better as well Happier than I thought I would be Exceeded my expectations Have had it a week easy I bought this Samsung Galaxy 7 phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it is just superb  I did make sure it was not the equipment that blew upit is NOT  I love everything about it  It is so elegant and has new features I love  Its also easy for a 65yearold to learn after you learn the phone wont explode if you press a wrong button  Phone is fastloading on the internet too  I love love love it  It can also be used internationally which is fabulous  Transfer of data from my old phone was a breeze  I bought my phone at Verizon and the salesman was just tremendously helpful Better than the Galaxy 4 tab I had But it still freezes up great phone easy to use Weve had the phone for over a week and its outstanding We added an ArmorSuit screen protector and Caseology leather case for style and protection Its as near perfect as can be It does draw fingerprints but not an issue now with the protection It should also have a front flash for better selfies but oh well still worth 5 stars I received this product because I had to downgrade from a Note 7 At first I thought I was going to lose more features but having it for a week or more it performs as good as a Note 7 expect obviously for any pen features I have not had any struggles which makes me happy Great phone getting another one soon Its quick slim and just a freaking awesome phone to have I got this to replace my Note 7 and Im not happy with it Its too small Came preloaded with freemium games and its not the Note I know thats not really verizons fault but the phone I really wanted was the note 7 I didnt have any problems with it This phone is a poor replacement I will never buy an iphone and the pixel is too new to know anything about so I guess Im stuck with something I dont like for now Was happy with S5 but delighted to have the S7  All the rough edges have been eliminated and the functions and apps seem to run even smoother  Good battery time Bought a week ago and it works great finger print does not work well and the phone is too expensive I went from an s4 to am s7 and the transfer was so simple The basic functions remained the same and the new features like the fingerprint to unlock it is so easy More memory along with the memory of my Sim card has made the speed of 4g lte has made it really fast I am now all to use android pay and I dont have to hardly ever take out my debit card Just so many conveniences had made me really happy  I love it I moved from iphone and this is what I have been waiting for
Camera is very good and processing power is nice as well
I hope that UX and software update is more fast Love the design How slick it is The features it has in the software so up there Very happy with my new S7 I switched to Samsung from an iPhone and so far Im very happy Great visuals very simple to use and very responsive  I also switched to Verizon from ATT and am very happy with their service and coverage areas I had 2 recalled note7 before I had to down grade to the 7 edge So far its pretty much the same phone with out the pen I had the S3 and loved it but ran out of memory space so I finally upgraded to the S7 Display is bright and easy to read takes good pictures quick responsiveness I am very pleased with this phone For me one of the best features is that it has a back button for easier navigation with apps or internet unlike that other brands device I resisted upgrading my old feature phone for almost 10 years since I mostly just use it to make  receive calls  texts but as a result also carry a tablet  and a small point  shoot camera This phone has replaced all with vastly superior capability Very happy and satisfied with my choice Only problem now requires increased mobile data plan usage and increased costs I bought it about a week ago not to impressive This phone gets very hot for no reason even when Im not using it and all the web pages are closed VR was cool but the phone over heats and gives a warming to shut down after 10 minutes or less Love everything about this phone The talk time is good and I have no problem hearing I love this phone Im a super busy mom of 6 kids and I can do multiple things at 1 time lots of voice active tasks can be completed also This is my first smartphone after having a flip phone for 11 yrs  The Samsung S7 is everything I expected it to be and then a whole bunch more  I cant imagine having any other brand or model of a smart phone Im still learning the phone but look and design are better The Samsung keyboard is better though I still prefer SwiftKey Love the speedy charge on a regular micro USB Been a Samsung user since the S5 came out I have upgraded each year I will say that this year 2016 is the first year I have had problems after doing the updates The phone is great it the IOS that is glitchy Good phone fast and reliable Very nice phone Battery life is better than expected This replaced a galaxy s4 Easy transition Call sound is very good  Nice fit in my hand Very pleased so far I love the phone so far I exchanged an iphone for this one and so far very satisfied very easy to operate Exceeds my expectations bought this samsung because i had this type before Great camera and amny features not the center point of my life I play with it as time allows While this smartphone is a little better than my S6 edge that I had it is nowhere near the Note 7 with exception of yes the battery My never caught fire or anything it never even got hot Both my S6 edge  S7 edge however get extremely hot The S7 has actually had a message on the phone saying the phone was working on cool itself down I really do miss the S Pen The Note 7 also seemed to work faster with less lag I think the Note 7 is also a betterlooking phone I am disappointed in having to use the S7 but there was nothing else out there to get that compared to the Note 7 and I will not use an iPhone The one thing that is better on the S7 is the battery I hope they continue to improve the battery life because it still does not keep up with the iPhone Maybe on standby when using it it seems to use up the battery quickly I am happy they have brought the Always On Display to the S7 They also need to work on the speaker phone for both devices I dropped my phone from waist height with a Case designed for Impact and a Screen protector on it They entire back of the phone is shattered I dropped it on Carpet No way to back up this phone to a PC or to see content on the phone Is this Verizons fault or Samsungs Beautifull elegant stylish phone love the edge screen features and detail Big plus water resistent and dust 55 screen love it Had many issues with the phone started appearing the pink lines on the screen and screen touch and typing keyboard no longer worksVery poor design Ive had the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini for 4 years and was apprehensive to upgrade due to pricing and the inconvenience of having to move information and reconfigure the new device to my liking but it was surprisingly easy to transition to my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Got this as a replacement for my Note 7 and it is terrible It basically does not function on WiFi all of my connections time out I read that this was an issue if you were running Bluetooth at the same time so I disabled Bluetooth but am still experiencing the same issues The only plus side is the size it actually fits in my pocket I bought this phone along with one for my father Its been easy to use making it easy to help my father with understanding how to use it Just bought this and it is a very nice phone with great features I bought this less than 2 weeks ago I couldnt be happier My only issue is I had to factory reset today from using the fingerprint security not using a digital code as well and restarting my phone locked me out I replaced my iPhone 5c with a Galaxy S7 and it is so easy to use Love Android and Google Chrome features Nice size recommend I absolutely love the galaxies and have had one ever since can remember BUT the edge feature on this tops them all It took me a minute to get used to it but now I absolutely love it and dont know if I could go back to a standard screen now It has been easy to customize the phone the way I want it The clarity of the screen is sensational I would definitely recommend this to a friend Honestly there isnt anything wrong with the phone itself It is kinda small for my taste but I am so used to having the note phones so this is considerably smaller in that case Overall a great phone just wish I had the chance to have the note 7 without risking anything I know I am a little late to purchasing this phone as it came out about 7 months ago however it was well worth the wait I was debating whether or not to go with the iPhone 7 being that it had just came out or the Galaxy s7 and I must say I am very happy with my decision I will definitely be trying some water shots with this baby A little sad that the eden is unavailable for purchase at cricket however you could always purchase an unlocked s7 edge from samsungcom and bring it to cricket I also love how easy it was to transfer Everything over from my s6 with the cable that came with the s7 Only thing I almost really freaked out over was that samsung music is not installed but I found it in the app store Also love the extra slot for storage I immediately put in a 200gb micro SD card Boom My phone is perfect have good performance and fine design
but little bit expensive Had to get this phone the other day because my wifes Galaxy S6 broke Overall it appears to be identical to the S6 except it does not appear to be any sturdier She cracked the screen 2 days after we bought it I bought the S7 on 1014 Call quality was poor Exchanged for another new S7 Call quality is fair to poor I have to use the speaker to get better quality sound Very disappointed  Love the Samsung Galaxy S7 but the glass screen protector from Verizon Wireless doesnt seem to fit on the screen all the way The edges wont stay ondont know how to explain it Plusbattery life could be better Battery drains a little too fasteven with it on standby Only had this a week or so replacing a Galaxy S4 This battery lasts so much longer

I havent had time to check out all the features yet I bought this phone last week and it has worked great Battery has stayed up a lot longer than the old one This phone is amazing The features design offers etc its all amazing The most thing I love about this phone is the waterproof Additionally the whole format of the screening Would like to see a more detailed manual to explain how to use features This phone is fine works great great features etc However I had a Note 7 and had to give it up because of the recall I lived the Note 7 and this phone feels mini after having it Other than the small feel its fine Pretty easy transition just need to have all passwords logged before giving up old phone for trade in  Phone still jams up a little  bit Bought this phone to replace S5 hoping there wouldnt be much difference  Not having too much trouble adapting This is a great phone  The only issue I have with it is the bloatware that Samsung and Verizon install on this thing If you could remove it without voiding the warranty it would be the best phone available on the market Not to mention much faster than it already is Overall the best Galaxy yet Bought this a week ago and absolutely love it This phone is replacing one of the wonderful note 7s that I had to return Being from apple originally I have grown to love the operating system  The biggest and only complaint is the battery I have to charge it to make it through the day My S6 went down to the bottom at a reefso I upgraded tot he S7   Generally it is about the same experience after about 6 or 7 hours to restore everything and reload apps   I think the battery is better and like the fact that I can expand the memory and particularly that it is again waterproof like the S5 I read that the S7 had a better camera but that I dont understand  It is a significant reduction in pixels but also is a 4x3 standard aspect ratio  vs the wide screen version on the S6 and S5   I would rather have my old camera back This phone doesnt hold a candle it and it locks up and freezes all the time I only had it a week and had to take it back twice Wish I had waited Every day it asks me to set up some feature that I dont want and repeatedly asks the same question Facebook comments freeze frequently since I got this phone  Also everything requires my location to be turned on to work  That was not a required permission previously I had to downgrade from a Note 7 I hate the simplicity of the galaxy 7 It feels small sluggish and has terrible battery life I love my new Galaxy S7 however there is one problem I have with it I cant download my contacts via Bluetooth with my new Subaru Forester I tried it with my Galaxy S5 and it worked fine Anyone else have this problem Ive had my new phone since Oct18th and I love it Pictures are awesome Needed to upgrade glad I did I bought this phone a week ago Im very happy with it Good phone Works good Only one thing that need to be fixed is the user guide installed on the phone Not enough information on different functions my old phone would read me my texts and allow me to voice back as well hands free this phone does not otherwise it is a nice phone easy transition from my samsung3 Replaced my Note 7 with this phone and dont like it all  It freezes and I have to use the close all button to get out of the app doesnt matter what app I am using it does it to them all My Galaxy s4 never did this and the Note 7 certainly didnt I really regret getting this phone but now Im stuck with it Was NOT my first choice Had to return my note 7 and this was pretty much ALL they had Im not really an old man but I use technology like one Basically my consumer strategy was to get a phone from the newest generation of Apples best competitor So far after a month or so Ive noticed the Swype function is not as intuitive as my last phone and while it charges quickly the battery does not last very long even with the few apps I use on it These problems are small to me overall I am very satisfied with the ease of handling and the structure This is a very nice phone Feels greats in the hand and the camera is very good good phone wish it was a little slimmer Wish the Samsung smart flip phone was available in the US So far so good I got this phone to replace a Galaxy S4 mini Not much of a learning curve to this phone Awesome camera Fast charger is really quick and battery lasts long As long as it doesnthe go up in flames Im happy with my purchase Really like how good the screen appears even in the bright sun light Great phone As easy to use as my previous one Has easy to use and access widgets Love the added memory I bought this phone a few weeks ago and so far Im glad I did Had to replace my dumb phone probably the last person on the planet to have one and my wifes work required her to also  This phone is easy for both of us to work with having to step up to the smart world  So we each got the Samsung Galaxy S7 and couldnt be happier two weeks in Very fast speeds The cameras are great I bought this less than a month ago and I dislike it so much I almost want to go to an IPhone I didnt feel that way with my last Galaxy Great quality phone I bought and absolutely loved the Note7 After the recalls and having to jump through hoops to return to recalled phone I decided on the S7 only because I was getting the 100 credit which would make up for all the cases and protectors I bought for the note7 that I got stuck with So I think Im unhappy because I am comparing it to the phone I wanted in the first place but was forced into Love the s7 Previously had the s6 Edge plus Honestly I didnt like the edge feature at all It looked nice but thats about it Not worth the extra money for me The s7 has an absolutely  incredible display and I couldnt be happier with it As far as size I find it perfect  not too big and not too small Highly recommend this phone I ALMOST thought of switching back to an iPhone Sooooooooo happy I didnt This phone is awesome I recently replaced my Samsung Galaxy SIII with the new Galaxy S7 The transition was pretty easy and I am pleased with my new phone Im still learning some of the features but look forward to making use of them I got the Samsung S7 to replace my Samsung Note 7 that had been recalled The S7 is a nice phone but a bit small for me I preferred the size and features of the Note 7 but until they come up with a replacement this will do I bought this phone a while ago for the most part its good  but the battery life sucks Like that it still tells time even if Im nit using phone water proof Have had it for over a month  Terrific phone  Much faster and sharper view than prior LG2  Just miss the LG double tap  Battery life is very good too I have had my phone 3 weeks unbelievable The cost to upgrade from s5 to s7 is not with the cost the camera and screen quality are better but not for the cost they took away a lot of features to set settings and customize They need to develop a way to transfer the settings to the new phone so you dont have to spend a lot of time setting up apps and account passwordso not a smooth transition Samsung has the best cell5 phones hands down I wouldnt buy any other phone I love my new Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy s7 is a nice phone It works good and is easy to use Nice phone still learning it from an S3 it has lots more features Love it Great upgrade to the S5 Faster and added features worth the upgradedoes Upgraded to new Samsung No problems Always I have had Samsung Galaxy and thats my preferred device Great phone water resistant a plus I lost my phone then someone found it which made me go purchase new s7 With trade in value of s5 it didnt hit as hard to upgrade my phone  I dont do much on phone but like the screen and color and that its water proof Im still looking to play some games on it by overall Im glad I left my s5 at the Verizon store Just thought it would be different the phone had more storage so I am able to get more apps and it responded quicker Good phone overall Not very user friendly at first but once you get used to it and have time to look into it its great Compatible with almost anything Ive tried to use The phone seems way too complex at first The battery gets really hot really fats so that is discouraging My S5 screen broke and I needed to upgrade and I had already decided to upgrade to the S7 I love the phone Its lightweight almost too much but a nice sturdy case makes it feel safer  especially when you drop it  which I have already

I was dreading the transfer of content from my old phone to this phone I was able to get the S5 powered up used SmartSwitch and within about an hour ALL of my content was on my new phone I am happy so far My other phone was on its last leg so I am happy this phone has a great battery life I bought 2weeks ago The phone battery drained so fast and hot battery excellent phone easy to access Bought this phone a week ago and love it so far It is faster than my S5 Love the speed Easy to use and takes great pictures This is the first smartphone I have personally owned and I am very happy with it I wish I got better signal reception at my house but that is the only concern so far I wanted a note and since the note 7 was recalled I asked about a note 5 and they said they had none anywhere for me to get so this is a cause they had nothing else I wanted phone Love this phone all my reservations were unfounded I was leary of the transition thinking it would be a major hassle but  not so amazed that I could get all my information done so easily as I though I was technically challengedAll the features of this phone are amazing  After having my Galaxy Note 7 recalled twice this is just as good as the Note 7 except for the battery charge life It is not as good running the same apps as the Note 7 battery but a lot better than my original G4 for sure The screen and camera are sufficient for my needs and the sound quality is excellent I just transitioned from the S5 to the S7 and love many of its features My only negative is the keys arent very sensitive but otherwise I love the phone Samsung 7 battery is not any better than my Samsung 4  Was told service would be better too and that is not true Decent phone battery drains quickly I had the S6 before The better battery life is what I need and reason for the switch Very sleek extra fast processor great camera Battery life is okay Great phone and features Bought two of the Galaxy S7s about a week ago and in under 48hrs both screens had cracked  We expected all the promises of water resistant crack resistant etc to be true We didnt go try to test that theory but a simple drop because of our young children getting ahold of them proved it false  Definitely disappointed with the lack of durability Also we were told the new bigger battery we upgraded from the S5 had been tested to last thru 18hrs of nonstop streaming Within about 6hrs of getting our phones they were dead  The battery life is extremely pathetic and we dont even have the  s7 edge The features of the phone itself are nice and we enjoy using it Although I miss the s pen on my previous phone this phone is more powerful and I am overall happy with it Needed upgrade my plan and needed a phone that could use itseems fullest potential Bought a week ago and love it Customer service never asked to buy my old phone Only had it a week and it hasnt caught fire yet it has been only 2 weeks with my new S7 So far so good Easy to learn functions well I loved my S4 but couldnt be happier now with my S7  While I enjoy the sleek design of the S7 Im disappointed in its durability I had my S5 for over 2 years without a case It was dropped on concrete and gravel ran through the washing machine and put through the elements It held up well with just a few scratches I have had the S7 for one week and the screen is already cracked It wasnt dropped or sat on but simply cracked while in my pocket The crack renders the water resistance capabilities useless which was a key reason for choosing this phone Not impressed I bought this phone a week ago   It is exactly like my s4 except all the aps are  not easy to find  Everything is grouped together now making it more confusing Great phone New HD voice on calls is great as is video calls prebuilt into the device Pretty pleased with my purchase Just got the new phone was told that the battery would last much longer and the new wireless charger would fast charge Have found neither to be true in fact its not any better than my S5 was It is a nice phone and Im not unhappy just disappointed that I didnt see any huge change from the S5 to S7 Great phone The processor is really fast There are many options to customize the phone Tons of apps to download The camera is amazing Ive owned several Galaxys after dropping IPhones years ago This is the best most powerful unit yet and I have never once had a problem with this phones features I had the Note 7 and had to give it up for this device  Missing the IR blaster of the note 4 5 to control the TV Camera is really nice here as well Has a low light feature for night photos that are grainy and blurry as to be expected without a 14 CMOS and a low light lens strapped to a tripod

Processor feels snappy and finger print reader is functional But due to smaller size the physical restrictions limit battery size and thus capacity is less  Im not sure if its their noise cancelling software or what is causing this however about 14 of my calls sound like the other person is talking across a tin canstring phone at the ear piece  As is the trend with smaller phones so goes the speaker making audio playback via headphones a must  Thank you for retaining the headphones port 


 I was getting spoiled with the more robust USBCenter connection of the note7 and had to revert to the micro USB on the S7

Tried using the Samsung easy transfer USB cable connection and after watching the bar shuffle across the screen at the store for 15 hours and nothing seemed to happen we gave up and used their in house account losing my settings but seeming to retain my data

If Samsung comes out with a note8 Im dropping this thing like a melting battery I love my phone It is working great and does what I want it to do The only thing I would change is to make it easier to uninstall Samsung Pay I dont want to use this and it updates frequently which is annoying to me I had to trade in my note7 for this and I just cant get use to it plus I thinks its refurbished Its always freezing up Very disappointed Ive had this phone for a week I love the size smaller than the turbo I had  but it only lasts one day on a battery charge with moderate use This S7 has great features is easy to use  the camera has lots of options for taking pics and everything has the feel of quality Be careful if you are opposed to phone cases like I am because this phone is slippery The only problem is it gets a little hot at times Had purchased the phone I wanted and was happy with it until I kept getting pop ups every time I charged it The S7 Edge is not the same as the Note 7 Better features and love the camera I really like this machine The display is top flight and I find that the Play Store is better than other stores I would appreciate if I were able to photo share with my wife who uses a different phoneset but that is a small price to play It has a lot of really good things going for it Bought 13 days ago miss my old Samsung touch screen hard to get it to type slow access to web if I didnt live 2 hours from store Id take it back I upgraded from an S5 to an S7 and the S5 was much faster and gave me less issues I lose connection to the internet even though Im on Wifi and my data wont work at times My calls drop after 1 ring Its been awful I loved my Galaxy S4 so much that I didnt think you could offer a phone that I would like more I was wrong My S7 is fabulous It is sleek and classy with smooth operating features Im sold on Samsung and I do love my new phone Mostly the same features as my galaxy 4 way better camera shorter battery life love the larger onboard memory Very nice and clean design The platinum gold is eye popping cokorsone of the same features that I enjoy including the selfie snapping using the flash And the extended memory but disappointed about the IR blaster not being on this model I found that it becomes hot when streaming live videos and multiple apps But not deal breaker I love my Samsung Looks nice and all but my galaxy s5 is more light weight and definitely faster on the Internet I dont like the keyboard changes You get used to having the  on the D key and now it is on the X key and other changes like that Couldnt leave well enough alone There are a few other issues but with time I am sure Ill figure it out Or if I were a techie nerd it probably wouldnt be an issue at all Love the S7 Easy transition from S5 to the S7 Love the new Phone The Galaxy 7 is a good phone but he Note series is so much better I love the phone I havent had any issues Ended up switching to this after having to return two NOTE7s Big disappointment Battery doesnt hold like my old iPhone 5 did when it was new Definitely more customization options than an iPhone but seems slower and has more junk on it out of the box that you have to delete Big disappointment I did like the Note other than the explosions and recall fiasco Good all around products i love this phone best on the market awesome product easy to used i can do anything i want without using my computer i love it i have recommended to my whole family and friends thats why i purchased 2 Galaxy s7 edge Looks like I have a winner S7 was not my first choice but had to turn in Note7 Most everything transferred over A little smaller but lighter Other choices were either heavier or required new learning curve Decided to stay with what was familiar Unfortunately I had to exchange my Note 7 for another phone I wanted to stay with Samsung because I love their thoughtful design Fortunately the Galaxy Edge 7 was a good fit for a replacement I have had my new phone for less that a month I am extremely satisfied I highly recommend Verizon for awesome service I just bought Galaxy S7 and it works great The best phone for everything Awesome camera screen looks great and is fast I love the phone in my opinion it is the best phone out there for my purposes  The phone itself gets 5 stars  But my biggest dislike is that it Verizon removed the Samsung app Find My Mobile  Apparently Samsung still includes it with the phone but Verizon removed it when they tweak the software for their phones  Not the end of the world though there are other apps out there that do similar I just havent found one yet that is as much to my liking After having a note 5 then 7 getting the s7 feels like a step down I love how big the screen is and how bright the screen is too Although I miss my Note 7 very much the Samsung Galaxy 7 was the best replacement I could have chosen  More or less identical features and nice added feature of waterproof I am so happy with this phone I was reluctant to give up my Nokia windows phone but with such limitations of selections of apps and more not being updated or being cancelled all of the time I decided it was time for a change One of my biggest concerns was if I would be able to link my outlook calendar to my phone as my windows phone had done I downloaded the outlook app and tied in perfectly This phone is easy to use light weight big but not too big and has a huge selection of apps Very easy to transition to and amazing to use Very much loving  this 
Samsung Galaxy S7 Its nice some improvements from the s5 which was my last phone  I dont know if its the protective glass on the screen but the touch screen seems slightly off which slows swiping and texting in an annoying way Ive had this phone for a few weeks and I LOVE it The camera is better the screen is better Thank you Samsung for a great phone I am a 68 year old senior and I find this phone easy to use with great functionality I converted 2 fellow flip phone users to smart Samsung phones after giving them a demo Drawbacks include the fact that its an internal battery like iphones and the sim slot design too Feels like i have an iphone just because of this two Other than that galaxy ftw As the title says this is my 1st galaxy to own  and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with the details and features it comes with I havent been able to play around with the camera much or anything  except for a few minutes being goofy with my son checking out the options  but it is AWESOME so far
The ONLY issue I have with it is the battery life  it could use some improvement  majorly I have done all the tips and taken the phone to the store even thinking that it was a bad phone but its still not the best
Other than that this is the greatest phone  I will definitely be buying another new one when the next upgrade is due I have used these for a couple days thru some pretty intense workouts they stay snug in place and the sound quality is excellent I sweat pretty bad and the wireless design is very comfortable Also the noise cancelling is awesome I love the fact that they have built in memory so I dont have to have my phone with me to listen to music or record my workouts I upgraded from the galaxy grand prime and very happy I choose the S7 I like the s7 edge I had the note 7 after first recall it was a great phone if it was not for the recall I would still have the note 7 but switched to this it is great No noticeable lag difference although through testing I can see cpu has more load then note 7 But cant tell its a lovely phone overall I have owned this phone for a few months It works well except for the battery life I must recharge the S7 about every 4  6 hours depending on use The battery does not hold a charge I wish the blacklist feature was on this phone like others in messeges Dont have the option like other cell phone carriers Also downloaded several message apps that didnt work that other ppl use Dont like radio either compared to itunes Loved my note 7_ better this is OK This phone is great  slim and fast pricing is a bit high though Great phone just upgraded from an old Samsung Note 4 Best battery life of any phone I have used I got this during the note 7 recall I like this phone alot This is my third galaxy Turned in my note7 and best buy didnt have any s7edge to replace it with  Said they could get them but Id be without a phone for a week  Not willing to forgo a phone for a week I settled for what they had to offeran s7  had to buy a new case its much smaller loss of functionality from the note7 now Ill have to have this for 2 years and Im already unhappy with it  Not a happy camper  Not sure about what to do with this account with 7 lines on it  Would be great if customer service would try to make things rightbetter Switched from I phone 6 Bought a month ago easy to use This phone is so nice to look at The pictures on the internet dont do it justice You have to see it in person The phone is also a great size and very nice to hold and handle I cant believe I held out on a Samsung phone this long Every feature and option you could want in a phone and the best screen on any device The best camera on any device Just go to any of the famous Youtubers and they will tell you the Galaxy S7 Edge is one of the best smartphones available today I have an I phone for work and this galaxy s7 edge is by far way better than my I phone way better features a lot faster and picture quality you cant compare and also the edge features are really cool Im really enjoying this phone can wait for the note 8 Ive only had it a couple weeks and its mostly great The touch screen is calibrated differently than what I am used to and the screen sometimes blacks out in the middle of short videos and tasks but the OS is lightning fast and the camera is brilliant Well see how it wears Once again Samsung has made the best phone out there My previous phone was the S5 and the improvements on the S7 are impressive The screen is brighter and the colors are the vivid out there The camera is by far the best Samsung has offered I have read reviews that say the speaker quality is suffering because of the waterproofing In my opinion this is the loudest and clearest Samsung speaker yet It might be a step below the sound of the iPhone but it is getting closer with every release The biggest thing I noticed when I received my Galaxy S7 edge is the quality of materials Everything from the phone to the box it comes in are just top of the line The metal back and wrap around glass is beautiful All of the cheap plastic is gone Even the charging port cover that breaks off after a month or two is gone without affecting the waterproofing Even the earbuds are improved They sound great are better looking and more comfortable With all the improvements and the expandable memory slot there are far fewer reason to pick the iPhone over the Galaxy All comes down to which operating system you prefer This is by far the best phone Samsung has released I bought the Note 7 and loved the size features and performance  I am sad that there is nothing comparable to it presently on the market  The 7 is okay but honestly besides the split screen and longer battery life at the moment I dont see much difference in the 7 from my Galaxy 5 Phone was great when I first got it then after about 2 weeks the screen would freeze up every now and again while I was doing something on it easy to use its just joy to have I just got this phone after being hesitant for 45 months about upgrading due to price I ended up upgrading sooner then Id like being my S5 messed up on me and BOY am I LOVING my S7 Especially with having a small child the camera captures so many moments that my S5 wouldnt of The features are easier and smoother also The screen is nicer I could go on and on about how much Ilove my S7 I love this phone so much better than my old phone and much better coverage and service Great battery life easy to useLove it times 10 Ive had the S7 edge for nearly 6 months and had to get a replacement I wont lie the phone has been dropped several times and I dodged the inevitable broken screen more than once however over the weekend a seemingly innocuous fall from  2 managed to land exactly on the screen glass corner on a tile floor The digitizer was immediately ruined green line down the entire edge and the glass shattered but not on the exterior surface I immediately sought out a replacement because I really do like this phone and it has been exceptionally durable 
It has landed in water by accident and it kept working Even with the broken screen it still functions well 
I find it very responsive and it does everything that I ask of it Great phone and great service its a winwin I have been using Samsung phones for a while now and have very impressed with them I was hoping to move to the Note 7 but since it got canceled I stayed with the S series Hope one day they will bring back the Note or something similar I recently upgraded to a new phone and I really enjoy this new phone I am one of the one that had originally upgraded to the note 7 and in comparison this phone lacks I am a Samsung fan and will be for some time but I want my Note back The battery life is not as good as that of the Note 7 I changed my phone recently to the new Galaxy S7 edge I have ALWAYS loved Samsung products especially the phones I honestly think is the best brand in the market I dont regret changing my phone to this new Galaxy S7 edge Its an Amazing device The camera the size the color how fast it is the features how simple it is to understand in fact everything about it I just love it And I would definitely encourage and recommend those of you who read me to take the step and make the change as well You wont regret it Updated from Galaxy S5 Really nice display and much improved camera Still learning to use edge panel  not sure if that is worth the hype Battery life is better than expected easier to use than my other phone I had this phone for less than one week the Verizon associate assured me that it was shatter resistant and that the screen was very durable I DROPPED IT ON THE CARPET and the screen shattered to bits Also the associate told me that my contacts had been downloaded and after telling him 3 times that only some were there he assured me that they all were well they arent and apparently Samsung and Google do not communicate well enough to show all contacts For example when i try to call the office I have to type the entire phone number into the keypad and it does not recognize it as a saved number However when the office calls me all of the contact information is there This is not in any way useful nor is it an improvement from my HTC One M8 which I am strongly considering going back to Switched from S6 Edge to S7 
Pros Im impressed with the screensize water resistance and camera not protruding out as it used to before on S6 Edge A bit bulky but understandable for the battery size

Cons My S6 Edge had some pink lines on the screen due to LCD break but its an internal thing I believe its due to bad bendability I do not have any cracks externally Learnt many similar issues on internet and hope this issue would be resolved soon
Gets dusty very quickly and your fingerprints would be very visible on the screen and back Have had a Samsung for at least 14 years  had apple and Motorola didnt  like either  one of them this phone is the closet one to the Note 7 which I was and still totally love This phone although I have only had for less then a week it a very good phone It has all well almost the same features of the note 7 
Its take wonderful pictures the screens are bright and clear The battery holds it charge forever never had a problem with the Note 7 Ive had this phone about a week and love it so far  Camera is awesome  Definitely make sure you get a good case because it is much more slippery compared to my last Samsung I went 4 days without a case  I was constantly catching it as it slipped away  Its awesome now that I have a good case Its only been two weeks since Ive had it but so far its pretty awesome The only down side is that the screen protector doesnt cover the Full screen only the majority Other than that I have no problems Like this phone allot The phone has so many features that I am a bit overwhelmed since its my first smartphone even on its easy mode  A simple laminated card to get started on the most basic functions would be helpful After my third iPhone I decided to switch to Android and I love it would rather have my note back or get a note 8 when they come out I like the Android OS better than Iphone so this is the easy choice Samsung has been very good and reliable over the last two years so I decided to upgrade from S5 to S7 It is great so far I was having problems powering off my LG G4 which kept losing power even while it was being charged So I decided to pay the balance and buy this phone I previously owned the Galaxy S5 and was happy with that phone  As of now I am very happy with the S7 I have had the phone for a week Light years  ahead of the phone I had before I liked having the note 7 I had to downgrade I understand the safety concerns but Im still not happy with having to get a phone I didnt want I had an S5 and it was about 3 years old  It died last week  I am very pleased with my new S7 especially the new USB charging and the wireless charger I purchased  It was very easy to get set up using my cloud backup  So far no complaints except with the new clock app  I dont like it as much as I did the old one I had  I also have an issue with preloaded games  I dont need them and dont want them why do they take up space on my phone Upgraded my phone from an s5 to the s7 and it was an easy transition One major con is that there is no way to adjust the screenkeyboard sensitivity You could calibrate the screen on the older models and although you can dl screen sensitivity apps they dont really work I bought this phone a few weeks ago I had the s4 and s6 before this phone and was extremely happy with thone two so I wanted to try the s7 Im not as please with this one as I was with the other 2 This one over heats freezes and is alot slower then the other 2 Also I was disappointed that  they took the remote controller app out Its not a horrible phone just not as satisfied as I was with the other 2 I have owned I got this phone a week ago and I hate it did very good phone easy to work and it charges very fast i love it Very easy to use Easy transition from old equipment This phone is sleek sophisticated the gold color fits my style its faster and the battery life is very good Overall it is a very solid phone from Samsung I upgraded from the S4 I recently upgraded to the S7 as my old S5 was having some software issues I have to say while the S7 has some nice features the camera and water resistance at the top of that list I dont like it as well as my S5 Overall it just feels like many of the apps require more clicks to get to your end result than the S5 did particularly with texts and calendars

Primarily my phone is a phone I use the phone calendar and text features and a little bit as a camera It is not a gaming device or mobile internet surfing device for me generally I use the text feature almost as often as I talk I find the text apps on the S7 more cumbersome It requires more steps to delete messages and the autocorrect feature is my new nemesis Super cool when I have typed correctly the word I want and it gets changed This becomes a battle of wills and ultimately the check mark wins It is frustrating that it requires several clicks to tell the phone that yes indeed I am not incapable To delete a text requires pulling down an additional menu and confirming at least twice that you want the text deleted So happy my phone has my back and wants to really verify that I know what Im talking about

All kidding and minor annoyances aside  the camera on this phone is a decent quality I am a DSLR camera person so no cell phone out there right now matches that for me but for a cell phone camera I find the S7 convenient and sharp with some nice editing features I do like the low light option and found that it does well without being blurry or overly saturated with background light Having additional storage for those photos and music files is also a great feature

Ultimately in this day and age to cling to an old favorite is like insisting your old vinyl was better than your iPod and digital downloads To each their own technology moves forward anyway For me personally I dont like having the extra steps on my text apps and calendar I liked my S5 but as I grow to know the S7 Im sure Ill adjust It just makes me feel better to whine about the good ol days Upgraded from the S5 which I loved It made the move to the S7 Edge very impressive The feel of the phone is so smooth its ridiculous and looking at it at eye level shows a stunning design The functions that come with are right on the money Its very responsive and easy to use Im so impressed by the screen every time I use it Extremely Happy with the S7 Edge I was starting to have issues with my S4 and replaced it with the S7 Went to my local Verizon store and received excellent service  So far so good transfer of data was made easy with device supplied to link phones Everything went smoothly and phone is operating perfectly Love how easy the phone is to use The updates are very nice compared to the older version Great phone  Easy transition from the S5  Its light And GOLD Samsung still lacks in the battery life department Although this model is much improved over my old Galaxy S3 it still doesnt last over 25 days and thats if I dont use it very much and certainly not for watching media or playing games After shattering my screen on my LG G4 I was talked into this Galaxy S7 I miss having an extra battery  to exchange not liking features 
either It feels like Im missing things like my widgets my quick keys that I can add that I actually use Design is a bit slippery great for displaying fingerprints Will definitely invest in covercase Just seems like a plain mediocre fragile phone My husband and I both bought the S7 Galaxy  This is the first time we have had a phone that actually has great service in our remote area They are so easy to learn to use I love this phone So easy to use the camera is awesome I really love my new smartphone I had a flip phone before and it was okay but this is so much better Very pleased with my new phone The transition from S5 to S7 was a little difficult  I really miss being able to add words to the dictionary  This phone does not anticipate my words like the S5 did  I like the addition of a flashlight I did not want to trade in my s5 because I really liked that phone but it was time Im happy with everything except fast charge isnt as fast as the s5 And the battery life not quite as long Im happy with my phone sometime the reception isnt  good I like the features battery life and excellent signal I had to upgrade because I fell in a creek Other than loosing the Samsung Apps and the Peel Smart Remote and the Music Player that was internal to the phone I also wanted a white phone not the gold So I went with black as I hated the gold Ive had my S7 for about 2 weeks and I couldnt be happier  Perfect size for my pocket or purse  Easy to use and battery life is great have it over 2 weeks and leaning the uniqueness I had to switch carriers got approved right away and love new phones sometimes doesnt get service in certain areas I have use this phone to offen and not too many apps and battery still run down and it slow charging it tak about 2 hours to get  fully charge I had sony Z3V it take 45 min to 1 hours charge I switch back to sony phone So far best phone ever Great speed beautiful screenfantastic camera I love it I was very excited to purchase the S7 I bought it before vacation The camera was awesome It allowed me to leave my DSLR at home Great photos great features Then the glass lens on the camera shattered while the phone was charging The phone was extremely hot to the touch I started searching online and found many others who had their cameras shatter while using their phones normally Not because of dropping them not because of abuse I contacted Samsung and they blame the users Ive continually contacted them and gotten stonewalled Based on the battery problems Samsung is having I would stay away from their products completely Basic android workability  Battery life is good Sounds good and is intuitive So far so good Easy to transition to So Ive had the Galaxy 7 about 2 weeks and I do really enjoy it but theres definitely some features that are different from the iPhones that have had in the past that I do miss Specifically there are some apps that I used a lot in my work that are not available with Android phones or the equivalent is not as good Additionally its a little bit more cumbersome with the different apps Apple has everything working seamlessly but none apple phones are a bit piecemeal So you kind of have to pick between going all Samsung apps versus all Google apps versus Verizon apps  if you ve had iPhones it can be a bit frustrating because none of them communicate with each other well it seems to take me more steps to do things then my iPhone did   However the storage is amazing on this the pictures and videos are just unreal the selfie functiontimer is niceand other things i cant think of right now  I was really getting annoyed with the apple isms like being forced to update or challenged as the oh so intelligent apple genius told me use cloud storage aka pay for it all in all a phone is a phone I cant say its earth shattering there are things I really like that are different and things I miss So far I have experienced all that expected Great design excellent graphics The Camera is the best I have a very good lock with all my galaxys I love that it has kids mode for my little one The phone itself is nice clean and easy to use I am a little frustrated because it wont connect to my home network for more than a minute or two and I cant seem to figure out why Also there isnt a tempered glass screen protector for this phone  well there is but it doesnt stick on all the way and the edges peel up Other than that the service is excellent and every time Ive been to the store Ive had amazing assistance in every aspect I just wish it would connect to my dang internet Was able to get it personalized just like the s6 but better Love the expandable memory  Still wont mirrorlink to my honda but thats not the fault of the phone in terms of performance the phone is an absolute winner  Few people could argue against that  Its a samsung and its pricetag is set high for a reason  The downside however is the design  The glass screen has mildly curved edges even though its not an S7 Edge  While that may look kind of neat it has the unfortunate side effect of not allowing many cases and screen protectors to work together harmoniously  Usually cases easily push off the edges of screen protectors and not allowing them to stick properly to the curved edges causing the screen protector to get air bubbles and dust underneath it Very pleased with me new S7 still looking for a case to protect it since it is quite thin and fragile I purchased the S7 because of the Samsung reputation and I have been impressed with it so far  The screen is crystal clear the HD calling is definitely a vast improvement over my last phone and the operating system is responsive  I do not take a lot of pictures but the few I have taken are very sharp with appropriate color and contrast  So far I have not found anything that I dont like about this phone I bought this 2 days ago  I am still learning  I am going to enjoy having my phone The screen is a good size The camera is excellent I have had my phone almost 2 weeks It does NOT play nice with glass screen protectors The phone is slightly rounded on the outside edges meaning you will have an air bubble almost 14 inch wide straight up and down the sides of your phone not a good option Also the speaker is bad on this phone there is only one on the bottom of the phone by the charging port the sound is not directed well and if you want to watch a show you have to cup your hand to get sound to you Even doing that the sound does not have good clarity Over all I regret buying this phone Its a good phone I like it better than my iPhone 5 I have found the S7 is fairly easy to use but the battery doesnt seem to stay charged for very long and I cant swapcharge it with a charged battery as I did with my previous Lumia phone I also have to remove the phone cover every time I want to use my Gear VR I like the phone as this is my 3rd Samsung  What I didnt like was all the spam that was somehow loaded on the phone  It may have been something I did or it may have been on at activation but it was extremely annoying and unwanted I have yet to use the camera which I was told is much better than the cameras on previous Galaxy phones  Im not real keen on the payment plan that they now use for upgrades however because of the changes they are making to usage and per phone charges Im actually paying less monthly  Good thing because if it wasnt a good deal I would not have upgraded and may have moved my service I like how it has a fast charge when charging the battery It is absolutely unbelievable to think that such a Wonder of modern technology not only exists but fits in the palm of my hand And the fact that they are able to make it water resistant and look absolutely gorgeous is like gold flake icing on top of a billiondollar cake I have had the phone a week now and I like it It holds a charge for a decent amount of timeand is very similar to the Galaxy s5 I previously owned I hope this phone lasts as long So the phone was easy to transition to from my old S5 but I was upgrading hoping to get better battery life as a few hard years on my S5 had taken its toll and the phone was only lasting half a day anymore  Well unfortunately with hard use thats all that I can get out of my week old s7 as well  I really like the wireless charging though and the fast charger is a savior of a phone that can drain its battery as fast as this Perfect phone  An absolute joy to use Bought the phone 2 weeks ago Very happy with the phone Unhappy with Verizon service  They sold me a screen protector that was junk and added a device insurance program that they didnt ask about and if they had asked if would have refused  it just showed up on our bill Hope you guys keep the galaxy note alive Ill be waiting for it Love the phone  only complaint is the battery  doesnt hold charge for that long  wish it lasted longer  this is only a very minor issue  otherwise phone is great Much better than my old s4 The phone is easy to use it has great features The camera takes awesome pictures I highly recommend purchasing the Galaxy S7 I have used a handful of modern cellphones and every single one of them has their pluses and minuses The Samsung S7 Edge was chosen because it had at least a 55 screen The cost seems a bit high but as the old saying goes you get what you pay for What you get with this smartphone is plenty of memory decent upgradeable storage a sharp colorful Goriilla Glass 4 Super AMOLED screen and a very fast octacore processor Add in the great camera for both front and back and you have a cellphone that doesnt lack in any known area 

The edge screen may seem a bit difficult to get used to but it is not It makes for a slimmer easier to hold in your hand or fit in your pocket device It has additional features such as a fingerprint lock auto display brightness and water resistance This phone is very lightweight as well

If a larger size phone with great features is within your budget I recommend this one It literally took BJs Verizon store 3 hours to set up my new phonea complete nightmare  Also and more importantly this phone isnt compatible with my FM Transmitter that worked perfectly well on old phone Called Verizon Customer Service but no help at all  Now waiting to hear back from the company that makes the transmitter  If not compatible I will trade this phone back in Easy transition and intuitive I like the camera Amazing does everything I ask it to and more no issues Ive had it for a few weeks now Had a samsung S5 before The battery doesnt seem to be improved much but other than that no problems  I was afraid to buy this one after reading reviews about reception being poor but havent had any problems My S5 had problems with reception but the S7 is fine where I had problems before Just got it o er a week ago Still learning features bought the phone a week ago and I dont like it is slow when I try to access anything on the phone and dont have good reception Best phone Ive ever had I love the camera and the photos the phone produces along with videos that were transferred to my new Samsung S7 I bought the galaxy s7 two weeks ago and so far it has been great I had the s6 and this is definitely a nice upgrade My only concern is that the video sent to a different phone comes out pixelated and blurry I am not sure why I am very pleased with the phone  I had the S4  and the upgrade to the S7 and I like all the new enhancements Much better than my really old LG This is a nice easy to use phone Getting into the setting is very easy Great phone and features  Purchased to use with an LG Android smart watch It was time for an upgrade so I got a new phone plus about the same price as I was paying before with more data and roll over My wife bought the S7 for me without my knowledge  I didnt think I would like a smartphone but the S7 has made the transition easier than I thought Have this phone for 2 weeks and love it  I had the S4 but now I have the S7 This is much better This is my first Samsung phone and I am sure it will not be my last The S7 seems to do everything well I love that the time and date are always visible Camera is amazing Calls are crystal clear Best smart phone hands down I bought my Samsung S7 last week and I absolutely love it it fits comfortably in my hand and the features are awesome Ivery only had my S7 for a week but love it so far I love the new galaxy s7 It definitely an upgrade over its predecessors  Love my phone It is wonderful and would recommend it to anyone I have gotten the note 7 but unfortunately it was recall So next option was the s7 The phone works well and lives up to most of the hype from online reviews  Unfortunately the battery life with daily use for me ranges between 4 to 5 hours  This is much less than my previous S5 or my partners S6 and much less than manufacturer specs  Recharging it so often during the day is a bit frustrating I bought this phone a week ago and the screen broke after only a foot fall The Samsung galaxy s7 is supposed to have tough glass Thats a lie because my old galaxy core prime has been drppped a lot and the screen is fine This is my first smart phone  It is very easy to use Much faster and more responsive then my Galaxy S5 We were due for upgrades so my wife and I both got Galaxy S7s and both are extremely happy with our new phones With my previous phone I had calls drop out when I used my phone in our house  With the new phone I havent had this problem Very happy with the performance and speed of the s7 Great phone overall wouldnt use any other product except for Samsung Before this phone I had the Note 3 and was very happy with it This is a similar phone but faster Im enjoying it so far but I just have to get used to smaller everything Ive had the phone a couple of weeks and it is an improvement over my previous phone  which I loved and waited several months beyond the contract expiration to trade up We are pleased with our new phones  extremely happy with the service we got at Costco where we bought our phones I absolutely loved my note 7 I hated turning it in but understand why This is the closest phone I have found that feels and acts the same except some minor things I am a diehard Samsung fan Ive had the Note 1 Note 3 Note 7 and now the edge I dont think I will ever use a different manufacturer used to be it was a real pain to switch info from old phone to the new onebut if you were using a android before it takes a couple of min  to do very easy set up like everyone else wish the battery was better but I can get a little over a day with it and it charges a lot faster then the older Samsung or htc phones sound is not as good as the htc but is good enough Feels like I bought an iPhone again App icons looks the same from several years ago Sure S7 is fast but the battery drain gives me about much as up time as my 3 ½ year old Nokia 928 Windows phone Then it feels like I need to be PC administrator pro to reduce the battery drain or even uninstall apps Silly Still bummed Microsoft bought Nokia killing a great phone company And Microsoft making app makers rewrite apps 3 times in the last few years each for new platform leaving few apps for a Microsoft phone I dropped a TV on my old phone and had to get a replacement  I wish these phones would be the same size so otter boxes could be interchangeable Samsung must have stock in Otter Box I also wish the backs had a grippier surface  too slippery I also wish Verizon would let me decide which apps I want  NFL etc updates alone eat my data without my permission  I have my phone on Power Save but that does not seem to stop it eating data without my permission Had to exchange for the Note Seems greatonly smaller so far Like the email a lot The design isnt the best it feels unbalanced and top heavy in hand  The edge tab sides is very useful and can be personalized to app used or quick apps like calender and clock and calculator Battery life is avg  I have owned 6 Samsung cell phones and each one gets betterandBETTER  I also still own all 6  and all 6 still workgreat products
Edge 7 is a great phone sleek powerful and engaging 


Keep it up The new supercharging battery is longer lasting and charges very quickly This phone runs much cooler than my previous phone Very extensive and easytouse camera features Im using my phone more frequently than my large digital camera The weight is a little much and it is slippery but overall all it is a good device I Really love the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge This product has good speakers and also its waterproof Like how it changes the brightness of your screen I also like how it has the edge part It has a tab where you can pull out the apps which I think that is pretty neat This version seems to be a more intuitive and much faster than my older one So far do good It works very well I have had this phone for a week and can see the diffence I finally upgraded my s5 to the s7 I have been very pleased with both Samsung phones  

I just have to get used to the Google import of ALL contacts  But I will figure it out The great part of this phone for me is the memory my previous phone only had 10 gb of memory so I couldnt fully enjoy it I bought my new phone about a week ago and I am very happy with it I previously had a galaxy s3 for 4 years and decided to purchase the s7 after finding that the s3 was outdated for many apps and functions I didnt want to upgrade but I am happy that I did I also switched carriers I am very happy with Verizon so far I get service everywhere My previous carrier did not have service in many areas Verizon is a little more expensive but I am happy this far so it is worth it I bought this phone a few weeks ago and no other phone comes close to it Bought it two weeks ago What a great improvement over my S5 Love the sleek styling all the features that I need plus moreAlso User friendlyIts fast 
I have a tendency to use if more than my laptop to search the web I have had my Galaxy S7 for about a week now I upgraded from the S5 and can really see all the features I was missing out on Glad I upgraded when i did This device works awesome with my other Samsung devices including the Gear S2 and the Icon X headphones Would highly recommend this phone to anyone I like everything about this phonei am a fan for life Had to pay full price since att did not offer promotions I love it because its water proof and the edge desing its feels and looks like something diffrentgreat phone basically the best one i ever have had The good 
Camera is pretty sharp screen resolution is nice 

The rest 
Screen cracked on the second day after purchase whilst sitting in my pocket As I was  examining the damage the crack propagated from the top left corner all the way down to the button at the bottom before my very eyes I seriously doubt that all the water resistant dust resistant blah blah blah certifications mean anything now 

The screen is so close to the edges of the phone that supporting the bottom with ones pinky or gripping the bezel frequently results in unintended touchscreen input Holding the phone in a manner that avoids this nuisance is inconvenient and uncomfortable 

Forget about using it in landscape mode without accidentally pressing every button and fumbling around trying not to drop it

Battery life is poor 

Bottom line
Get this phone if you want a decent camera and screen resolution with an android OS in a terribly fragile uncomfortable and inconvenient package that looks like an iPhone Ive had it about a week and still learning more about it The most astonishing feature is the battery life it lasts so long that I dont need to use my power bank anymore And the edge is so beautiful that I peeled off my screen protector lol For the camera I just want to say its perfect and with pro mode I can take excellent photos with it Great I love it I purchased this phone 3 months ago June 2016 First upgrade in four years You know that commercial where the guy bobbles the phone and drops it in a puddle of water Well dont try that because if it breaks when that happens you are not covered by the warranty And dont let the salesperson tell you you are Yesterday while working in the yard I went to put my phone in my pocket and dropped it Thats about a three foot drop The screen shattered to the point where I cant even turn the phone off I thought maybe Samsung with all their problems would be interested in stepping up but they said there was NOTHING they could do for me Im done with Samsung I like the screen size and resolution Camera is much better than my last phone I come in much clearer during phone calls Great features like swipe to screen shot However I do have to push harderlonger on the screen Keeps losing my contacts I bought this phone right before a trip to New Zealand  I came back with the most amazing pictures and video  It has tons of capacity and the international calling feature worked great Not much to this  phone its what you see and its what you get no bells or whistles Ive had the phone for a couple weeks and so far and very pleased  My wife also got the same phone and her headphone jack didnt work out of the box  Luckily its not a feature she uses often  The features were enough similar to the S4 that I had previously that everything seemed familiar but the new technology is stellar  I dont know who uses these things for phone calls anymore but the call clarity is amazing  It is by far the best call clarity ever Im new to technology so it took me a litte while to understand how to use my new Galaxy S7 but now Im getting to see how things work My only problem now is that Ill have to start carrying purse big enough to hold the phone Got this galaxy s7 and it is awesome Loved my Note 7 both of them and wanted to replace it with the next best option The screen is slightly smaller but not noticeably smaller No S Pen but I tried another stylus which worked perfectly I do miss the blue light filter Since that is an Android feature Im really hoping that Samsung provides it as an update soon I dont notice any difference in the galaxy 5 and the new galaxy 7 With the exception that my new phone charges and holds a charger better  longer new battery Overall this is a great phone The specs are comparable to the Note 7 without the fear of smoking or exploding I have one major issue and that is the internal storage capacity The SD Card does not make up for the amount of internal storage It was not a bright idea to lower the internal memory Next phone should offer 32 and 64 GB of internal memory along with SD storage Customization is one of main reasons we love our Android phones however when you move some apps to the SD card You lose that feature 

The design of the phone is unique The Edge features are original Butwhen it comes to protecting your phone with a screen protector and case its been difficult to find both Most of us desire to protect our phones I am not sure if this issue can truly be resolved My next phone may have to be a regular S just so I can properly protect it Went from a 4 to a 7

So much better Just wish I could figure out where the missed call alert is hiding Love it faster and easier to use Love the fast charger  the double click home button to turn on the camera  the incredible 1440x2560 super crisp display  the amoled time display when phone is turned off  the ability to change screen grid to 4x5 icons  the easy way to move icons from one screen to another  the list goes on The average user will be happy the techie user like me will find lots of other useful features as well I used my GS7 for a month and convinced my husband last week to upgrade as well Hes an average user and hes just as happy as I am I was so happy with the previous galaxy 6 but this phone does not allow me to get online and my calls go in and out So frustrating I like this cell phone I wanted a bigger one but too expensive I replaced my G3 with this phone and have been very happy with it I have owned it for a couple of weeks and found that it was very easy to use I am not happy at all with this phone and would like to exchange it without incurring a restocking fee Please help I also purchased the fast charger which i will not if i exchange the Galxy S7 for a Note5 I got this phone after the Note 7 was recalled again So far its been a good phone Traded up from a galaxy 4 So glad I did Couldnt be happier Literally everything is better on this phone The only problem I have and dont like is that when I am on Facebook and change screens to continue reading substance and then go back it does not go back to where I was but goes back to the beginning of Facebook Otherwise I am very satisfied I bought this last week and Im in love I receive the phone a week ago and so far I like it The phone is peppy and switches screens without lag Battery life exceeds 18 hours of moderate use The quick charger is impressive  I like the size because it fits nicely in my shirt pocket Already had a Samsung  6 so I knew how great they operste Had my S4 Mini for three years but cant find healthy batteries for it can only find dry cells manufactured three years ago  S7 is a great phone but it is too expensive and too big   Not a pocket phone OS is much more restrictive that Galaxy S5  Apps have become more complicated to use Very satisfied with the phone I bought the Samsung galaxy s7 about a week ago I have had no problems works great cant wait to see how well it works after months of use It works great nd does wat I need it to no problems This phone is way better than the iPhone or any other phone that Ive ever owned Phone is fast good battery life awesome camera If you want a phone thats as fast as the world is today get a Samsung The phone seemed great until I noticed the numerous deep scratches in both the screen and back of the phone casing This is supposed to be gorilla glass but standard window glass resists scratching infinitely better than this I dont even have anything around the phone that should be capable of scratching it Mohs scale of hardness it gets its own pocket in my jeans Ive had a Galaxy S5 for two years and it doesnt have a scratch in the screen and this thing is practically wrecked after a week

Verizon has violated their own Return Policy and wont accept it claiming its user damage Unless Samsung replaces it for me through warranty Ill be switching to Tmobile I should probably switch anyways if they violate their own published policies and this is how they treat customers For me it gets too hot still when charging and when Im on the phone This worries me The charge does not stay much longer than the Galaxy 4 that I traded in and that is even when the Galaxy 4 was already giving me troubles Not sure if I got a bad battery in the phone or if this is just how its made Other than these issues all I can say is its a phone and I use it Im not a gadget enthusiast so I it may take a lot to impress me Just the facts folks Using this phone is easy thought I wouldnt like it but this phone continues to impress I loved my Note7 Really loved it The S7 Edge is a let down after my Note7

Its too light and just doesnt fit my hand well I loved the curved edge on my Note but on the S7 its awkward to use and makes the phone difficult to grip 

Also disappointed that while it runs Marshmallow the interface is drastically different than the Note7 It seems stupid but I LOVED that I could toggle on and off alarms without having to mess with the days or delete them Everything just seems clunkier Hopefully the update to Nougat will help when that comes around

Other than the cons when compared to the Note7 this is a good phone Sound quality is great processor is fast storage is sufficient and allows for SD Card Had I not had a Note7 first Im sure I would have loved this phone I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5 I like the functionality of the Samsung and the camera takes excellent pictures My disappointment is that I had to replace the first S7 within a week as it was defective It kept restarting even when I was in the middle of a phone call There also is an app on the phone that was included but is no longer supported by Samsung and cannot be removed Samsung Milk Music I had S6 and wanted the latest greatest  I thought I ordered the edge but mistakenly ordered s7  Most fragile phone I have ever had  dropped 11 inches and the back spidered  Slipped off of a desk and both sides cracked like safety glass  very disappointed S7 Is a great phone to have Overall there isnt a lot of difference The functionality that Google offers with the apps will be really good once Im able to get used to it Overall the phone is good and has been user friendly especially since I switched from iPhone One thing that annoys me about the phone is that the screen is too sensitive along the edges it opens apps etc just from me picking up my phone Other than that I dont mind the switch I give this phone 5 stars The phone get hot your review are to long myou nickname has letters and numbers I REALLY LOVE MY NEW GALS7 I have almost no complaints about this phone other than the curved screen Its hard to protect the screen without tempered glass or an Otterbox This phone is incredible in so many ways The first thing you see is the sleek and thin design and the contious curve from edge to edge Then when turned on its a perfectly parallel experience to its design The UI is fluid amd easy to use and is incredibly fast The camera is beyond anything i have ever seen on a phone and the fact that it is waterproof is awesome Not the phone I wanted its the best of the rest the camera works good I love my new phone I received this phone through my insurance four days ago Its been kept in the provided case never dropped and I noticed the rear surface of the telephone is cracked The back of the telephone is curved and the smooth glass panel offers little purchase for someone with slick fingertips Precision is required when using swype more so than my previous GS4 Overall a nervewracking phone to own Samsung is overall the best you can get Went from Samsung to iPhone its awesome Print on phone is easier to read than previous model Also like that phone is thinner and not as heavy Replaced my Droid for Samsung 7 in order to have better apps due to hearing aid Bluetooth capability not covered by the Droid   Seamless transition Beautiful pictures and screen clarity This is a good looking phone slim sleek and soft rounded edges I just upgraded from the S4 and love the S7 It has more features that are great for me and is very easy to use Got the phone two weeks ago and love it easy to use Ive only had the phone for two weeks now so Im still adjusting to it  Even though its larger than the Galaxy S4 Mini that it has replaced it still fits comfortably in my hand  However I do wish that the phones could be smaller to fit more easily into my pockets  The screen is much sharper than the S4 Mini and it holds a charge much longer  I added the flexible glass screen protector and so far it is very easy to navigate I purchased the Samsung 7 last week and I love it Ive had my phone for a few weeks and love the speed of the phone Ive had my phone for a little over a week  I really like it I like all the features  how much you can customize everything The only thing I have an issue with is the battery It doesnt last as long as Im used to with my old HTC phone Its great having a super fast charger but I feel like Im charging it a lot for a new phone Back to the things I like I really like the size of the phone Its not too big  it fits nicely in my hand Its very fast I find that I dont have to wait for anything I click on which is especially nice when it comes to the camera  the gallery I love how fast both apps open I also like how fast you can transition to the gallery from the camera after taking a picture Another thing I find super helpful is having the ability to share directly from the screen after taking a screenshot I use this feature a lot I like being able to delete screenshots from the notification bar as well I was very happy to see such a wide variety of options and features available for me to look at edit change  customize in the settings application I went through each topic  made sure I fully understood it  made the phone my own I really like the thumb print access too Overall the phone has exceeded my expectations The only thing I have a problem with is battery life which is unfortunate because thats kind of a big deal Besides that the phone is exactly what I needed  wanted I was an HTC customer only owning HTC phones since I first owned a smartphone but I took a gamble  got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Fortunately this is a decision I do not regret Im glad I have made the switch because this is really a great phone  Im much happier with it than I thought I would be I didnt expect to love it so much Had it before still enjoying it as my lost one Upgraded to S7 from  S6 edge Very easy to operate love it Great picture excellent processor quick adapts well Whatever you do dont let it out of your hand  The phone was dropped while getting out of a car maybe 15 feet and the screen shatteredeven with a protective case  Save spending the extra 150 insurance deductible and buy a better phone By fare the best samsung phone i have owned Gold color stands out nice and sleek
Samsung did is again and it offer great features as well almost like a handheld mini tablet on the go with the phone and samsung pay to top if all off couldnt as for more Thank You Samsung decent phone a bit slippery without a case and the operating system is bogged down with big corporation apps until you clean it up Amazing features and tons of added fun I recently upgraded and I couldnt be more satisfied with my choice and experience I got the s7 after having the Note 7 I really enjoy the size of the phone It fits in my pants pocket with not problem It a great phone I was hesitant to go for such a upgrade But I cant imagine any othere phone Its snagging Bought the phone less than a month ago I thought that the camera would be better The phone is OK but I may go with another brand on my next upgrade We bought out phones Sunday Oct 2  we have had a lot of issues with them My husband was trying to call his son  it wouldnt go out We do not get half the service we use too It just not like our other phones We are very disappointed in these phones Weve had the S5 and S6 and now the S7 Like that the S7 is water resistant and has great screen However the phone doesnt make it through the day on full charge more often than I would like It is frustrating to have a phone die when away from home Only have had it one week but so far I love it There isnt a more stylish or better performing on the market in my opinion I love the way this phone feels in your hand and it is extremely fast I hate the Samsung bloatware but you can work around that for the most part using third party skinsetc So overall a fantastic phone certainly far better than the iPhone 7 And the display is FAR better 

That said it is plagued with issues The first one I bought died after only a few weeks I got a new one and have had several service calls on it  and they were major issues that kept me from using the phone The phone runs so hot you can barely touch it at times 

So it is an Oxymoron of a phone I love the phone but find that it is plagued with service issues so give it both high and low marks

Bottom line  would I buy one again I dont think so Great Features of new Phone Desperate move paid off The only thing i dont care for is the battery life sucks compared to my note 3 and note 5 I had No issues at all Cool new features My title says it all The Galaxy S7 Edge is a genius piece of technology Period Thanks Its a nice looking phone but its confusing trying to figure out how to do simple stuff like download a ringtone This is my 3 Samsung phone and its the least impressive cell phone to date  The buttons arent sensitive the battery drains very fast and the WiFi Antenna primary reason why I traded in my old phone isnt much better if better at all Had to buy a phone without much research but this one seems great Vibrant clear screen intuitive to use and much like my old phone so the switch was easy I got this a little over a week ago and was able to get everything from my old phone to my new phone real quick Really love the new features Great phone love the memory expansion Ive only had this phone a week but I really like it so far The picture is so clear and bright the camera is great and its very fast So far my only criticism is the sound on calls On both ends the sound seems like it had an echo to it Head replacement phone butt somebody elses phone caught on fire had no choice what to replace this not taking that chance of a fire this phone is a downgrade i bought this phone 2 weeks ago My first time using galaxy and I love it has great effects and looks amazing Very fast great display and camera It runs apps seamlessly and has wonderful  sound and picture  quality even the camera is top notch Ive only had the phone a week and think its the best device  out now A huge improvement overall on the Galaxy  series platform Very fast but a Lil too sensitive will have to adjust to it I have had this for 3 weeks it is a great phone I dont like this phone  I switched from Motorola to samsung  I will definitely go back to Motorola  One positive is nice camera All good  now issues Best on the market I bought this phone about a week ago and its already giving me a hard time It is slow and keeps not opening apps I think I want to switch to an iPhone all around this is a great product almost as fuctional as my desktop waterproofing is a real plus
the negative question for the galaxy s7 is WHY is the internal memory not going up 32gb seems exstreamly small for the amount of information and apps loaded on these phones i know a lot of places are pushing for the cloud to be used but for me i want my info to be on my phone 
 Samsung make this happen I know you can THANKS Swapped all information from a FIRE phone The transfer was seamless  Samsung phone has been a gem Security is substantial with the use of fingerprint recognition Samsung Pay  the ability to shut down the phone if it is stolen The camera is awesome The phone fits in a pocket  reacts quickly When Google options are added the phone is an inseparable family member It is a great phone Love the design of the phone its not too bulky and big The OS is really user friendly It has a lot of great features Just bought this phone a week ago Having lots of fun with it  great features and clear screen Only had it a few days love it Just got s7 a week ago I bought this phone two weeks ago and absolutely love it The design of the back of the phone is the reason for my low Why is it made of something that can shatter I was going to put my phone in my pocket while sitting on my bed and I missed my pocket It only fell about 25ft onto a hardwood floor When I picked it up the back had a large crack that spread out across the back of the phone I have a glass screen protector but am still waiting for my case to arrive in the mail its currently about 3 days out I just got this phone 928 and its all ready falling apart faster than my old phone I had the Galaxy S4 and it survived 2 years with only a few dings on the side and I did drop it a few times without a case on The phone performs amazingly well and it is unfortunate that the outside design is not on the same level as the internal workings of the phone Great size Easy to use It takes great photos Takes great pictures and very easy to use Love this phone This is awsome phoneIt has great cameragreat featuresetcIts battery is also so good
Awesome features like 4g lte durable easy to use GPS great camera great for texting large screen great web browsing keyboard long battery life memory music speakerphone touch screen useful apps volume level WiFi I upgraded from a S6 I love the HD voice I bought this phone a week ago and love it I bought it a few weeks ago and the only problems so far has been a bad Sim card I started off with a moto droid yrs ago then upgraded to iphone 4s hated it upgraded to iphone 6 a couple yrs ago it was ok upgraded to samsung s7 edge several months ago and absolutely love it My wife and son are upgrading 6 to samsung next week Solid phone Good camera System provided to transfer info from previous phone was handy I bought this phone a week ago The salesperson was very helpful There was or is a few glitches such as the installed weather app Definitely dont like it Tried to download  and install several weather apps that stopped working or wont  work on my phone Accuweather not good Dont  like the Google search bar I would like  more customizable  choices in color or transparent Happy with my phone I always love Samsung products Overall quite satisfied  Nice to have the extra memory  Still have not been able to configure wireless to default on startupwakeup  Uses data to connect  Have to manually tell it to use wireless May not know how to work all its apps and tricks for quite awhilebut already love the camera and the long battery life Fast and easy to use but uses up battery charge quickly Its perfect I love everything about it greatphone really like it My husband needed an upgrade and he loves his new phone Got it j a few weeks but it works awesome Good phone Only down fall is the battery drains way to fast constantly have to charge Had this phone just over a week  Terrific battery life tons of memory great camera and has the ability to add an sd card  Couldnt be happier with my choice The Glass back makes this phone really slick  Waterproof without needing any special care  The phone looks great and works great Bought 1 week ago and love it Upgraded from Samsung S5 to the 7 and so glad I did Only had it a few weeks but its been great I had an S4 and loved it This phone is easierfaster and sharper I hope that it lasts a long time as my other phone did We bought this as my daughters first phone  After a couple of weeks I am definitely a bit jealous  It is fast and the battery life is pretty good I just have a week with it and i love it more than my s6 My last phone was an LG G2 which was faster to charge wirelessly which had an IR blaster which let me double click the screen to sleep and wakeup and which had the buttons on the back where I could reach them I bought the Samsung because LG ditched all these features The S7 also lacks these features and is only better in that it cable charges very fast At least it can charge wirelessly even though its slower than the old LG The new LGs cannot even charge wirelessly The camera is supposed to be better but Ill never notice a difference probably The buttons are on the side where they are hard to reach instead of on the back like the G2 The new Android lacks a lot of the convenience of old Android no media volume control in the dropdown less customization in the dropdown etc Its just very disappointing that the latest and greatest is missing so many features and adds seemingly nothing Love the phone and features glad I upgraded  However the keyboard isnt as sensitive as the S5 and Ive noticed while typing it will miss letters and spaces  Very annoying hopefully there is a fix and I havent found it yet I love it its a great phone I had a galaxy 5 then had to down grade because the galaxy broke and I didnt get insurance The razor I had obviously was no comparison and as soon as I was eligible for an upgrade I got the 7s and Im am so thankful for this awesome easy to navigate phone Im expecting my third daughter very soon and cant wait to capture every moment of her life with the great camera Wonderful phone  Only problem was with setting up voice mail and learning how to get to Google Play I bought about 2 weeks ago Love the phone I bought a cheaper smart phone to replace the cheap one I had before but returned it after a few days when I realized you get what you pay for Trust me get top of the line and you will have less troubles and much better performance I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and found it easy to use  It gives nice pictures and very clear quality voice Only been a few days but Im enjoying my new phone Great phone Very quick lots of great apps very sharp images love the fingerprint opening love the grouping of the  appsBattery seems OK lasts all day 
Havent had time to play with the camera much yet but feel it should be great as well I originally purchased this phone because I enjoy to get out on the water a lot and take pictures while kayaking or fishing Having this phone has given me peace of mind while out on the water and I truly love the processing speed and battery life of this phone I bought this a week ago and am really enjoying it I bought this over a week ago Id like to change over to IPhone but the storage is way too expensive monthly So my biggest pet peeves are the 
1 text messaging 
2 where the buttons are located I keep turning the sound down accidentally
3 the keyboard touch sensitivity  i have to push hard for the space bar to work

I cant snap screenshots easily because the button has been moved since the S7 is much smaller than the S5 the screens are the same size but the phone is smaller The text messaging program that I used on S5 was the default program that came with the phone it was simple and kept the icons of my favorites up the top I could change the background color of the conversation list so it wouldnt be so bright With the s7 that is no longer an option Also my finger keeps pressing on the volume button by mistake So now my phone is on vibrate when I want it to ring They say it takes 21 days to form new habits so I hope this will help me like this phone more still have some challenges but Im a 74 year old newby Like the features and larger screen Still havent been able to move my gallery over from my old phone Excellent Smart Phone for my first foray into the world of updated technology  Easy to use The battery life is no better than the HTC and it was 2 years old Cant hold the phone without inadvertently touching buttons on the side Attempting to unlock by double tapping notification doesnt go to the notification after unlocking Just a lot of things I expected to be better after other reviews have only had the phone for a few weeks but is works great and has not exploded as yet All in all good phone I just think that the ports usb and headphone jacks are ill placed at the bottom of the phone making it awkward to use while plugged in and impossible to sit vertically Also having the speaker there is bad I keep covering it with my hand or finger Having the power button almost directly across from the volume buttons poor design as well I accidentally turn my phone off when trying to turn the volume down I bought this phone a week ago  But I am concerned about all the battery burning stories  So Just cautious for now  I will return it with a full refund and damages if  it burns I got this a few weeks ago  Phone has performed very well  Had a little trouble setting up email but once done has worked well I love absolutely everything about my new phone and very happy with my choice I bought this phone last month and I am so happy that I did  I was using a very outdated LG smart phone that was very small  Texting for my business was difficult and I dreaded it  Now with my Galaxy S7 I love texting  The larger screen and keypad is so much easier to use  Before I never wanted my phone with me  It was such a nuisance  Now I dont want to go anywhere without it  The camera is also amazing  It takes wonderful photo and video compared to what I am used to Absolutely loving my new phone The clarity and responsiveness of this device is fantastic I cannot express how much I am enjoying this phone I upgraded my Samsung Galaxy 4 to a 7 and am very pleased  The battery life is much better I had the S5 for about 2 and a half years previous to my S7 After certain features were starting to not work I knew I needed a new phone and knew I wanted to stick with Samsung The Note and Edge both are amazing phones from brief usage in the store and seeing the new features in ads After testing them out in the store I came to the conclusion I wanted to stick to the regular S7 Its a perfect size for me and about the same size as my S5 I personally am not a huge fan of big phones as I dislike have large or bulky things in my pockets 

Anyway the S7 after now using it for 2 weeks is great I really like the updates to the operating system and hardware but most importantly how much it is like the S5 Menus system applications and customization are almost exactly like the S5 Its not that I dont like change when getting new electronics but it made operating my new phone much easier I didnt have that week of learning new menus keystrokes or paths It was simple and straightforward this phone  like all new phones has a few things that are missing or features that i dont like my two biggest problems is that there is no way to put phone numbers on the auto reject list and getting the burst shots turned off on the camera i like the fact that it is water resistant the volume and vibration is better than the s4 that i previously had the s7 is pretty much the same as the s4 other than the updating of the features and apps so far i am happy with the s7 I just switched to this phone and I love it The phone works like a dream and its amazing I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 through Verizon This is a very nice phone The camera is fantasticthe best I have ever owned on a phone The Verizon bloatware doesnt help but once its all disabled  the phone really shines I would recommend this phone Very happy with the Galaxy S7 After having a galaxy s6 die of water damage I couldnt be happier to know that the s7 would be water resistant I really like how it evolved and at the same time kept themail particular feel of the galaxy It works great and it is pretty fast I would just add the feature of installing apps in the micro sd given that 32gb is not a lot of storage for all apps I love Samsung  products very  happy I Love the themes setting for my new s7 I miss the remote app on my S5 I used it all the time I almost switched to an iPhone because I want FaceTime but I couldnt do it Samsung is great Thanks Im really trying to figure out all the features and and Im sure it will improve in my rating  I seriously wish it came with an instruction manual I dont own  a computer andor printer Im hopeful that one would miraculously appear in my mailbox Love the phone no issues But the phone is slippery without a case Something to think about when designing the 8 Can only use it for 5 minutes before it gets too hot to handle I had a galaxy 4 and the battery stay power of the 7 is eons better I use to carry a backup with me but no loner need it even if I am gone for 24 hours Would have given it a five if I did not have to unlock it each time at home I changed setting to eliminate the need at home but it still requires it after swipe if I havent used it for a few minutes I am on my home secure wifi network and it should just let me swipe Overall great phone certain apps do not work the same as the s4 I love my phone Its easy to use and very durable It is sleek lots of apps already loaded and very easy to use  Great pictures and excellent sound quality on calls  So happy I got a phone for my sister and husband It does all the neat things you want a smart phone to do I like the size and the ease of use I switched from 3 years with a Motorola phone and the biggest thing I miss is the Home Button The only way to get back to the home screen on this phone is by hitting the back button which is on the opposite side from the Motorola  and so are the volume controls This is annoying Other than that it holds a charge really well it is really fast operating and the cameras clarity and features are great Its compact size and weight are also very nice User friendly love all the fitures The Galaxy S7 Edge is really fun to use It takes a while to get accustomed to the Edge features and its obvious a lot of effort went into its design I really like the fast charging and the long battery life is refreshing It has the worst battery life than any previous Samsung phone that I have owned This is my first Galaxy always been prepaid and I love it  Great features and decent battery life Couldnt be happier Ive owned every other of generation since the S3 and this one is by far the smoothest operating phone Ive ever owned It looks amazing the camera quality is phenomenal the screen resolution is beyond anything Ive ever seen Overall a high quality product A very nice phone very intuitive interface Happy with the ohone and VZW as well Cool phone  Big screen works well good camera quality I upgraded my galaxy s4 for an s7 I love everything about it Love the larger key pad and swipe function as well as the processing speed I have had the phone about 2 weeks and really like it Very easy to use and navigate I had the S4 before and there is a big difference I really like the camera and how great the pictures come out No problemsnice Super easy transition from my S5 I couldnt find my phone at my grandsons party so had a friend call it Looked and looked with no results until I heard my grandson calling Mom I found Grandma JoJos phone  it was on the bottom of the pool  I heard it ringing and got it out Well only having the phone for a few days I panicked thinking I was out a large amount of money I turned it off for a while then checked everything which was dry and it was perfect No one at the party could believe the phone survived a half hour in the deep end of the pool and still worked I have had this device for about two weeks and it works great But I personally prefer my Note 5 because of the bigger screen makes it easier for me to type and I also like to use the pen feature that the Galaxy S7 edge lacks Its a good phone and I would recommend I recently moved from Europe to the USA and had an S4 S5 and the first Note This phone is amazing The quality of the pictures external memory design plus the water resistant feature were the strongest features for my decision I really like the gold platinum color option I gave this phone 4 stars because it is a bit slippery and tricky to hold but it does give it a nice sleekmodern look It is just a matter of personal preference I am pleasantly surprised at the ease of use of the S7 Edge Excellent phone I had a Samsung Galaxy S5 previously which I absolutely loved  Love the S7 even more Great phone I like all the features however I gave 4 stars because of the sound quality no matter how much I change the quality of the sound on the setup still it is not a good one It is a great product I love the features added to this phone It definitely met and surpassed expectations Love the design and look of it Bought 2 weeks ago and still finding new features Great plan great price  I love my new phone I had a Samsung S4 and I like that but I had it over 3 years and thought I should upgrade  So glad I did  I use Verizon and ever have any issues I have always used samsung products so a phone made by them was a no brainer for me It comes with some good preloaded apps and a nice sleek design Definitely recommend it for someone that is just getting onto the cellphone rollercoaster This is a good phone I have not had a chance to really do anything with it yet but it hasnt exploded yet so thats a plus wish I would have gotten the black one rose gold get me laughed at and beat up by the other sales engineers I work with but thats ok Been using the Galaxy S7 for just over a week  Replaced a 2year old android that I loved but his is even better  Faster and lighter yet still feels substantial Phone is a lot faster and more features make it easier to use I like the enhanced performance over the S6 but wish they wouldnt constantly change the look and feel of user interfaces Ive only had this phone for 6 days so far but I really like it It has a very nice display takes great pictures and the speakers are great I like it for the most part  its up swing from the 6 but I would say its not as big as I expected The biggest part is the extendable memory and better battery life 
What is not so good is the battery as in the 6 gets hot Considering the issues with the Note7 that is concerning I am glad I switched to the Galaxy S7 Had to exchange phone less then three days after I got it sim card was exchanged still having issues I love all the features and its easy to use I always buy Samsung phones It seems any tines we try anything else we are sorry facile navigation clear screen just wish the phone didnt automatically download games Love it  Way better than the iPhone  Would not go back I bought mine in Feb and we just how my husbands a week ago I bought the phone two weeks ago I got this phone after the note 7 recall Was a little gun shy on the note 7 there were other issues with the not Call quality was poor call reception was poor and internal speaker not up to par So i switched to samsung s7 I do no tlike its small size after years of being a note user I will just have to struggle with the unit until the note 8 arrives Phone has good features  Battery life is not exactly what I expected from a new phone Just got this phone today as my usual every 2 year upgrade and after playing with it I must say I love it The weight of the phone is nice and the sleek backing gives it really nice curb appeal The performance is completely different than my older Galaxy So far so great I have been an iPhone user for the past 7 years and wanted to try something different I have always been a fan of Samsung products so why not give their phone a try I purchased my Samsung s7 and love it already I only wish Samsung had a Imessage like feature as it was one of the things I loved most about my IPhone But the camera and Waterproofing and different customization settings on the Samsung make up for the lack of Message capabilities Keep up the good work Bought the s7 a week ago  So far I love it Great features and ease of use Great phone I have had this phone for a week  It took ONE small drop and the back now has a huge spiderweb crack  Lucky for me its on the back and usable  And while I have insurance on it  paying the deductible would mean that Id end up paying an extra 200  Overall the phone is nice works well but not worth it if you have kids  I suspect that even with it in its case and with the screen protector it will break again Ive been rough on all my other phones and have never had them break this way My wife and I upgraded our phones from Samsung Galaxy S3 to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and are both very happy with our choice We were looking at some of the unlocked phones but based on Verizons new unlocked policy and there nocontract plans we decided to buy the Samsung phones 

The performance is great battery life is great with Verizon we are able to use our phones many places we could not with our previous carrier and we also like the user interface This is the worst galaxy i have ever purchasedthe phone is always warm battery drops 20 an hourthe phone is slow as a galaxy s3 It has Great features that you cant even enjoy fully I had to trade my note 7 because of the recal but that was a wonderful no problem phone at all I am not happy with s7edge Had this phone for 5 days after the phone did an update the camera stopped working The camera is awesome Easy to use Got it a few weeks ago and love it so glad I did I have had many cell phones since about 1996 This is a little computer There are too many features to mention here I got a Samsung 128GB pro plus for it and now shoot fantastic 4K videos I put a hundred albums on it in high quality mp3 My favorite feature is fingerprint ID It works flawlessly Made profiles for both thumbs and forefingers Both 24 and 5Mhz WiFi Gorgeous screen Great bluetooth with Aptx for better sound Cant say enough good things about it More than just a phone Ive had this phone a week The battery holds up great and I love the features Great phone and easy to use I love Samsung products and am anow android fan I have only had this phone not even a month still learning about it Bought the s7 2 weeks ago I like it for the most part  Wish it were easier to find some featurescontrols The resolution is amazing
The camera far exceeds the I phone IVerna always had Samsung and then traded it for a Motorola bad mistake Now back to a galaxy phone and remembered you I like them so muh Easy to use and great camera I brought this phone about 1 week ago and its amazing I have never had a better phone Size is very thin and light weight  Just wish it had some texture on the back to keep from sliding Only 70 of phone numbers transfered from backup  No MHL support is a joke especially after the salesman at the Verizon store said my cord would still work  I might actually like my  S4 better  Too bad the screen quit working I had a 6S Edge that lasted 18 months before I had trouble hooking up a charger I liked it a lot and went with the 7S Edge as a replacement I really like this phone too including the external card option and the getting wet issue BUT I have a problem with Bluetooth I listen to audiobooks all the time With Bluetooth there is a split second hesitationsounds like a stutter about every 15 seconds This is with the LG Tone headset With the Mpow Jaws headset the split second hesitation turns into 1  2 seconds With regular headphones no problem I dont know if the bluetooth issue is with ATT or with Samsung but Im betting Samsung I have a holster type case and took it off The hesitation is still there but not as pronounced I would still get the Samsung Edge next time I hope they fix the bluetooth issue Im sure its not a problem listening to music since music is background noise and audiobook is more foreground Loving the phone Only have one problem my location for my weather and maps is wrong It keeps saying that I am in Missouri but I am in Alabama Cannot figure this out Happy I upgraded from my S4 to the S7  Battery last a lot longer and love the features the phone has to offer Great upgrade from the s4  Love having the now cards pop up I thought this would be an intimidating experience upgrading to the S7 To my surprise it has been flawless I believe I am going to like this one I have been using the S7 for about a week now and Im quite happy with it
The camera is WAY improved  Better focus and quicker pictures even in lower light conditions  Make sure you get an SD card for the storage as the increased resolution could eat up your memory quick
Speaking of SD storage access to the SD is improved with storage outside of the battery compartment sharing space with the SIM card
Audio is improved  louder and seems better directed towards the user
The interface itself is nicer  Samsung didnt go messing with the menus and locations too much so previous Galaxy users wont get frustrated from thumb memory
And to be expected performance from the better chipset is great
Oh yeah voice calling does seem better even in my homes reception blackhole
They also scooted the power button down a bit making it easier to reach with the thumb Still getting to know my new phone but so far very promising Amazing phone fits perfectly in my hand I love how the battery doesnt die so quick and if it does it charges up really quick Great camera as well Great phone has a great camera and is much faster than the 6 5 and 4 Had it a while pretty durable I had the phone about a week now The look and feel of the phone is really good camera quality is good Im new to andriod and getting apps is no problem The only thing I had a problem with was the waterproof case that did not have a bar code so I could not register it After chatting with Robert at Verizon f I was referred to the case company Robert assured me repeatedly that they could take care of the problem They could not They can certainly help me register the case but not without the bar code Now we have to drive clear across town again to get a case with a bar code This phone is Great have had for almost 2 months and only one problem so far But Verizon helped me fix it The phone takes great pictures and has so many options with it It is taking me awhile to learn all the little ins and outs of how to navigate it I had to upgrade because of software conflicts making my 25 yearold S4 mini partially useless  The S7 is good but its bigger and I really didnt want to spend the money on it Ive had this phone for about a week now and I dont really like it all the much Im hoping it grows on me the more I get use to it I bought this 2 weeks ago and love it I traded in my galaxy s 5  my s7 is much faster havent dropped 1 phone call I I will say that the battery holds up pretty good its very slim I didnt listen to all of the negative reviews cause my s5 was a great phone as well this is very fast surfing the Internet it takes great pictures if you are looking for a great phone you have to get the s7  Too expensive Although Samsung does make a good phone The phone is fast has a much better feel than previous Galaxy phones  Buttons a crisp feel  My only complaint and I dont know if its due to the lack of programming from Samsung or Google is the fact that you cannot set which WiFi spots to automatically connect to  Its pretty much all or none  I would like to just connect to specific spots like work and home automatically and not every WiFi my phone encounters because when its a weak signal it turns your phone into a useless brick while using tons of battery power trying to connect  until you turn the WiFi off  I would have held out for the new Pixel phones if Google hadnt choked with those having only an IP53 rating Good phone and good customer service from the Verizon store I got it from A very sleek little machine Ive owned it for only a week so Im still learning about its capabilities love the phone just wish it would announce the callers name like my old phone did Upgraded from Galaxy S4 Easy transition I love this phone  I had been an Apple fan since the iPhone 3 but admired the Samsung from afar  After Apple made the decision to abandon the headphone jack I I am happy with everything but the battery life  Plus to make matters worse the charger cord as came out easy twice in the last few weeks Very easy to use having owned an S4 prior to this Lots of great improvements  but also a few things that i dont like Its not as easy to move pictures between the device and the SD card I eventually figured it out but on the S4 it was very easy The Messaging app doesnt let you customize at all And i dont like that there is no longer a menu key like the older phones had Everyhing else on this phone is great I love this model phone The sleek design slim size and the overall performance Im so happy with this phone is cant think of any criticism for it other than the rounded screen edges makes it impossible to apply a full coverage glass screen protector The glass screen protectors that do fit have to leave a slight space around the edges I also love the Micro SD card comeback Im totally happy with this phone Ive only had this phone for a short time but it works great I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and its not much different from the s6 Phone is regular itsnothing spectacular  Wish I didnt buy it I do not like that a message count cannot be set for anything text messages emails FB twitter etc I really need this feature which makes my 4 a better phone I dont like the keyboard 
On the plus side the camera is great and takes stunning pictures Nice change  from HTC I was extremely hesitant to make the switch but I cant be more happy that I did I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy S7  I have had no problems at all with the transition I had the phone for a couple of weeks because of the Note 7 recall and it was good If you are coming from a Note to this phone then ut may seem like a slight downgrade but for what it can do it was a good substitute for my phone I bought the S7 as an upgrade to my iPhone6  First time using Android so this may not be fair but up to now I do not see any benefits over the IOS  About the same Much better than an iPhone but battery doesnt last to long and phone is always a little warmer than Id like I have a Galaxy 5 and wanted to upgrade and I got this phone and Im so in love with it I bought it a week ago and love it The S7 is a much improved version of the S5 I traded in better screen battery and processor  The interface is more usable and I no longer need a flashlight app as that comes built in now I love this great phone everything is awesome and love it I have had it less than a month and think it is wonderful Aorry I waited so long to get it Great phone Beautiful design Easy to use Battery life doesnt meet expectations This is our 3rd version of the phone Love how it can be customized for whatever i want 
Beautiful pictures and videos too Does what I need some cool new features as a new phone always does Very happy Love the phone Would be 5 stars but battery drains very fast Has everything I wanted I absolutely love this phone I switched from an iPhone to the s7 edge and its the greatest transition I couldve hoped for This phone can do so much more than what I was used to Its crazy fast and I love the way it looks Best phone I have ever owned I like how the phone functions and especially like the camera  It takes great pictures Awesome camera Long battery life microSD storage slot and waterresistant fast powerful
Great phone i have no complaints
I stepped up from a S4 to a S7
Love it Battery over hearts regularly  Phone has reset itself to factory twice not even in a week that Ive owned it Had the phone for about two weeks Love it  very similar to my s5 but love the upgrades Have only had it for a week and a half but its great so far Great Battery Life Awesome display and design Fast efficient and reliable Best camera on the market I switched from iphone to this phone and I absolutely love it Had it for a week so far no complaints I have had to replace this phone twice I have had to factory reset this phone twice and it continues to get hot The last thing a manager told me was it was really hot because it worked hard resetting and restoring my information Ive I had phone for a couple weeks and love everything about it  Great battery great look and feel and it has yet to freeze up on me like the 6 did I love this phone its simply the best phone out there other than the galaxy note 7 They both are great phones and i would recomend them to everyone Had an iPhone for 4 years and I knew I wanted to switch as soon as I got the opportunity to 

When my phone broke unexpectedly I needed a replacement I was on really short notice but thankfully had an upgrade 

Transitioning from different operating systems took time but Im very pleased I made the switch 

Great visuals and sharp camera Very happy with my phone I was an iPhone 6S owner I bought the S7 Edge and I enjoy it The screen is great and has awesome performance Love this phone I recently received the s7 edge because my note broke and the insurance company made me wait longer than expected for a replacement This phone runs hot It cuts out whenever and comes on whenever it wants I ordered 5 cases for the phone just to realize that I wouldnt find a case that would cover it enough for me secure it from falls etc I thought I would be so much happier with an updated phone coming from the note 4 but I was not I felt from the beginning that it works when wanted Am very happy with everything Very happy with this phone would recommend it highly So much better than an iPhone Fast processor amazing camera and I LOVE the expandable memory slot Ive got ALL my music on SD card The internal memory is not enough compared to Note 7 but the price difference is not that big I bought this a week ago and the battery lasts no better using Pandora than my 2 year old note 4 Bought it about a week ago to replace my S5 This is an awesome phone A couple of down sides is of course battery life and the headphone port being on the bottom of phone Its not a big deal but it can be annoying When I am on my treadmill I have to set my phone on the side instead of upright No biggie just something to get used to Love the camera Im going to struggle through for 2 years  maybe its just a steep learning curve Wish I would have stayed with iPhone After the S6 the BIGGEST improvements are battery life from miserable to very good less heat much betterfaster camera good storage solution micro SD card slot is back and much faster fingerprint recognition And it is never slowclunky if you have a job or are an active person do not get this phone its flimsy lags and is not worth the money u fortunately Im stuck with mine only positive is the clarity of the phone and pictures I have a lot yet to learn about the new phone Coming from a iphone 6s I can honestly say this phone is way better My only comment would be the phone has too much bloatware that affects the battery life I like my new 7 but you have to keep swiping to do anything with it I tried keeping it on but you still need to swipe to make a call view the calendar getsend messages It gets to be annoying after awhile Ive only had the phone for a couple weeks but the ease of use and apps is great I like very much Ive had it now for about 2 weeks and so far I love how easy this phone is to use and the features that it comes with I hate it everyday it will trun off and on and run the batter down bad I hate it I had an iPhone for years while my wife had a Samsung Galaxy  I made the mistake of listening to her and upgrading to the Galaxy S7  After six months I can tell you I absolutely hate this phone  Nothing is intuitive and nearly everything takes more effort than the iPhones I have used in the past  Does the iPhone have its own shortfalls  Yes  However I find the iPhone incredibly intuitive  I accepted there would be a learning curve with the new OS but this is beyond that

I do not get group messages and my group messages do not send  There is little compatibility between Android users and iOS users  This has been incredibly frustrating for myself and my familyfriends

Getting my device to sync with my home computer was another chore

My apps do not work as smoothly as they did on iPhone either which makes little sense to me

The curved edges make the cases and screen protectors look stupid and ineffective  I had a screen protector on my NONcurved iPhone for YEARS no cracks  I had my screen protector on the S7 and it is already cracked in two places after roughly six months  I dropped my iPhone more than this phone and had it for years  Stupid design  What is wrong with squared edges that easy fit screen protection and cases

Overall I have been very unimpressed with the device and its performance I like the phone because you can put applications to sleep and save battery lifethe out here thing is the Camara takes good action shots and the lowlight works good idea have also like the water and dust resistance Hate the phone design Wish I would of gotten a s6 active or iPhone screen is to think S7 is the same size as a grand amp prime FIRST I LOVE ALWAYS SAMSUNG PRODUCT FREEDG TVPHONELIKE ALL PRODUCT  BUT
 I BUY THIS PHONE ITS MY BIG MISTAKE AND ONE TIME BUY 2 PHONE ITS HUGE MISTACK
YOU NO WHAY  BECAUSE ITS NOT COVER SOFTWARE WARRANTY JUST BECAUSE BACK COVER GLASS CRACK AND ITS HAPPENED THIS MODEL ESEYLY BECAUSE IT IS GLASS 
 WHEN I BUY AND WHEN ITS COME MY HAND I DESIDE PUT GOOD STRONG COVER AND I BUY ONLINE COVER WHEN I FIX THIS COVER ITS HARD SO I PUSS HARDLY AND GLASS BROCK BUT STEEL PHONE WORKING GOOD UNTIL NOW BUT LAST WEEK ITS FREEZE AND NOT WORKING ALSO 
 WHEN FREEZING ITS TO MUCH HOT LOOK LIKE HOTPLATE UNTIL CHARGING DOWN ITS HORRIBLE  I SEND BACK THIS PHONE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER I DONT NO AFTER THAT HOWS MY PHONE WORKING AND HOW LONG LIFE  MAYBEE TWO THREE MONTH  SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT ITS TRUE WITHIN 23 MONTH PHONE FREEZING AND JUST BECAUSE BACK COVER CRACK ITS NOT COVER WARRANTEE BUT FREEZING IS SOFTWARE PROBLEM NOT ANY OTHER
 ALSO IM WORRID ABOUT MY 2ND S7EDGE PHONE BECAUSE NEVER NO WHEN STOPE WORKING  
 ALSO ITS NOT COVER SOFTWARE WARRANTY  I have been an iPhone users for years and switched over and it has been an amazing decision I dont regret it at all and I am in love with my phone The whole familly has Samsung Galaxy we love it s7 batter seems to last longer than the s6edge
love love love it I owned a S5 S6 and now S7 successively with Verizon The disappointing thing with this S7 phone is the screen is curved slightly downward at the edges It is not a practical design If you read the reviews on all the screen protectors for the S7 all get poor reviews They wont fit proper My Zagg glass screen protector does not contact on the edges it is a pain when trying to type and such and dust is constantly under the protector edges A case which encompasses the entire phone such as a Otterbox Defender which I used for my S6 will not work well The screen protector will not lay flat on the screen causing touch issues and allowing dust to get under the screen Poor design on Samsungs part to curve the screen I purchased this phoe a month or so ago and have been very happy with it to date I really just got this phone and so far Im liking it Coming from a Droid mini the screen size is impressive Havent really had time to do anything but set it up but the calls Ive had sound great Took a few pictures and so far the ones i took look amazing Its fast enough jumping around and loading and what Im loving is the batteryIm not charging 4 times a day like I was with the Droid works welleasy to see quick to chargehas a flashlight that works really well I bought my phone a week ago and it works great  easy to use  never a dropped call and battery life is real good If you are looking for a dependable phone the S7 is the one to get I bought 3 in March and we all love them This is one of best devices that I have owned and you can make phone calls It has taken a little getting used to but overall I liking it Just transitioned Phone overheats with only 5 to 7 minutes web browsing Battery life far less than S5 Great product  service Great phone with some extra nice features Love the phone Love it I like it better than my Samsung S 6 I got this phone a about a week ago and am wondering if I should upgrade to an edge I got this phone about a week ago It has been a very easy transition from my old phone and has amazing storage space I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 for my upgrade this month and couldnt be happier with my choice Samsung is the way to go Disclaimer I was a Note 7 user until I had to turn it in because of the recall I had decided to get the S7 edge as quite a few other people I knew had one My plan was to trade back to the Note 7 once the problems were fixed However after using the device for more than a few weeks I may wind up not changing 

Performance wise the S7 edge definitely uses its Snapdragon processor well Its quick to respond and only suffers from normal low signal low connection lag that almost all smartphones deal with 

The edge takes some getting used to and while its not as comfortable to hold sans case IMO it is a great design that with a little extra holdable and not touch sensitive space care of a small profile case is very comfortable to use 

Call quality is good screen quality is very good 

Some of the samsung software is useless to me but overall the bloatware is minimal and the samsung apps like edge buttons are actually functional if you find them useful 

Samsung pay is a great choice if youre not beholden to Android pay already I do miss from the Note7 the ability to swipe from the bottom of the screen to access Samsung pay but this is far from a deal breaker

Overall this is a great phone Time will tell if I wind up going back to the Note 7 but other than a few specific items only available on the Note 7 AOD notifications for example this phone is a perfect daily driver for someone used to maximium tech usage on the go Love the light weight design and all the features it has to offer I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants the latest model Love it I love my Samsung Edge 7 I went from a LG to My Edge and It is Amazing I was like what is the big deal it is a phone but the speakers are loud and you can add extra volume when in a noisy area No one has a problem hearing me when on Speaker phone The display is bright and readable And the Edge Feature is So handy it brings my frequently used contacts apps and the news right at my fingertips Wonderful feature Easy to learn also Great phone Extremely fast  and productive Best camera on a smartphone Cant beat the water resistance and looks great Was easy to set up and love the way it performs Did I mention that it looks great Also with the added SD card slot Samsung has a winer I have always been happy when using samsung products The  s7  is just a great phone  with a great design Got S7 instead of S6 as I was told its waterscratch resistant Its not It also heats up The screen is brighter than my old S4 but still lacking brightness in sunlight The sound is good but not loud enough for playing videos without headphones and the volume message when my cars Bluetooth connects is extremely annoying Too expensive for what it is Ive been seeing commercials about the phone and have been wanting it for months now and yes finally it has arrived in my country When I first held it I did not want to let it go the image quality the feel you get when holding it you just know this is no ordinary smartphone I love it I have been using note series for some time now but I have to say my change was not far from home but except now I was in heaven Android is by far the best OS ever built and I would never trade it Couldnt have a better phone for the features and options Very user friendly 1 Best phone and especially liked the Samsung
 The Galaxy S7 is a little difficult for me What I do not like about it is the messaging keeps wanting to switch from Messages to Messenger I cant keep it set to Messages The other feature I dont like is when you want to delete the messages from phone calls You have to press delete 3 times Why not just once And I cant delete messages from Messenger One thing I do like about this phone the pictures are very clear I like the slimness of the phone The screen is bright and the colors are sharp I got this phone about a week ago and it has been a seamless transition from the S5 I will always go with Samsung it has been the best in my experience Samsung Galaxy phones are literally the best phones right now If youre thinking of switching get this or the Note 7 Ive just purchased my new S7 and cannot wait to begin the journeysleek and sexy and water resistantperfect for rainy day pics in the garden It was fast and smooth Camera was excellent Multitasking was easy I moved from the Lumia 950 XL to the S7 Edge for the apps but I found it so much better and a lot easier to use than I thought it would be Its a little slippery so I would invest in a case for it and theres plenty to choose from I TRADED MY IPHONE FOR A GALAXY 5 AND LOVED ITTHE EXPANDED MEMORY A AND THE REMOVABLE BATTERY A REAL NOW THE NEW AND IMPROVED GALAXY 7 WITH A BATTERY WHICH IS NOT REMOVABLE EXCEPT BY YOUAND AN EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT 
BATTERY LASTS BETWEEN 6  7 HOURS OF NORMAL USE DURING MY BUSINESS DAYYOUR FAST CHARGER TAKES 2 HOURS TO RECHARGEWHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR THE CONSUMERWHY CANT YOU PUT A BATTERY IN A PHONE WITH THE GREAT FEATURES OF A GALAXY 7 THAT WILL WORK FOR THE CONSUMER AT LEAST 12 HOURS OF A BUSINESS DAY WITHOUT RECHARGINGPERIOD I exchanged my Note 7 which I didnt have any trouble with but I had to replace it So I replaces ed it with the s7 edge worst decision ever The phone doesnt have a good weight to it at all Its to thin and why would you Samsung make the front and back with glass I dropped it the second day and cracked the front and back of the phoneI wish I could have kept my Note 7 now that phone was impressive Samsung please replace my phone I cant take it back to ATT because of my mishap I have been using it for past few months
I am very satisfied with features
If certainly has several features to owners life lot easier
Decide what you want to accomplish with this SmartPhone and owner will be pleased to find a way to just do that I just got this phone on 91816 as an upgrade as my previous phone was accidentally pushed into a sink of water
   I was upset that my niece damaged it  upset that the previous salesman I bough the phone from a yr Ago never had insurance on it All my Verizon phones always had full insurance  my daughters also when I paid for her phone on my acct  Ive been with VW last 25 yrs Phone is great Performance wise its very fast I use Samsung pay 75 of the time I need use of a credit card The battery could be better but overall a good phone I must note that this is my first nonApple device since the 1st iPhone came out and I have e no intention of going back Wish the battery lasted longer but still a good phone Ive always had samsung phones so I splurged when the S7 edge came out I was excited for a bigger screen and more features and mostly the great picture and video quality Well Im on my 5th phone from warranty with ATT Ive had one problem after another First time just days after getting it my screen went completely dark green and could not use it I could hear the notifications but I had no screen Ive had problems after that with the new phone that it kept saying to check for moisture when I plugged it to charge Then I got another one and the selfie camera feature did not work and when I tried to make it work my phone crashed completely I got another one sent and that one freezes everytime I try to scroll through my photo album or watch one of my videos One of the main reasons I purchased this phone was for the quality of camera and video features for I use that part often I may be calling to switch different phones all together This Phone is so amazing I have had absolutely no problems with the software or design 
The hardware is a different story This phone fill very expensive and great and I love that but it is very fragile  all glass design The screen cracked from a foot high with a military grade case Yeah the cracks are really in your face I cant complain because this phone is so awesome Thanks so much Samsung My goal is to work for you someday I absolutely love my phone  Highest quality of products We own 7 Samsung devices  love every one of them  Love my new phone Nice upgrade The camera is great love the edge and everything at my fingertips It works fast and so far no issues I recently upgraded from phone I had a Galaxy Grand Prime from TMobile and switched to Verizon All I have to say is that the S7 is a giant step up from the phone I had More memory better camera speaker and everything is just amazing I love the new phone and I have already gotten three of my friends to choose it over the iPhone 7 Its a beautiful piece of technology but I dont like the fact that wrapping my fingers around the phone when I pick it up or just change positions does something I dont intend like typing edge characters or sending FB likes to something I hate 
Then last night sitting on the patio the phone slid off my lap and fell about 15 feet The back of the phone has cracks spreading from side to side and to top to bottom with one wrapping around to the front I love my phone but I wish it didnt get so hot and I really wish the GPS was more accurate With that said I doubt I will every purchase anything but Samsung in the future I bought this a week ago and think its great A lot of features responds quickly and WATERPROOFWHAT  Seriously this is an excellent phone and cant wait until I find how to use all its features I have had several Samsung devices throughout the years and have found them to be quite reliable Samsung has been at the front of innovation in recent years in my opinion From heart rate monitors to wireless charging to water resistance Samsung delivers innovative solutions I would have giver 5 stars if the battery could last longer Other than that this is a great product 3 good years with a Galaxy S4 Active  thought an upgrade to a Galaxy S7 would be a good idea  32 gig base memory  great camera  was a satisfied customer  until I found out that the case was made of glass and could not take a hit without cracking  apparently many others are finding fault with this product for the same reason  too bad  always thought Samsung was right on top of things  Have had the s7 for 2 weeks Love the screen clarity speaker is very clear and has good battery life Upgraded 2 weeks ago  Love the camera capabilities memory expansion capability screen quality and high speed charging I truly wanted the Note 5 64 Gig but they dont carry them in stock It would take a week to receive one Thats not acceptable when my phone is my lifemy everything I needed a phone that Sunday since my S4 died the night before Im lost without a phone Ive had this a week and like my S5 bettet So far so good It is much cooler than my Stratosphere I miss having a pullout keyboard thoughsniffle sniffle great phone plenty fast but even with power saving mode on I seem to go through battery life faster than my company phone Galaxy S5 if power saving mode is on and I turn the screen back on from being in a sleep state I notice I have to turn off wireless or data and turn it back on again to be able to access the internet services otherwise it will say connected but it will not access the internet at all extremely annoying I bought this phone a few months ago and its great The camera on this phone is excellent Phone is easy to use has lots of extra features lowlight camera has a very good picture I just wish us cellular hado better service This is the most elegant piece of technology I have ever owned I love my phone Its biggest design strength is also its biggest design weakness There are no cases that can simultaneously facilitate the functionality of the edge screen and protect it as well There are a lot of new features that my old phone didnt have Its been great so far I was nervous to go from the iPhone to the Android network but the Samsung has been a more powerful and useful phone  I can make it look and feel the way I want it to so it is customized to me I brought my phone 2 weeks ago and Im glad I did So much faster than the Samsung Galaxy 5
Great phone This phone has all the bells and whistles but fails to do its main job make calls
I have had the most dropped calls since switching from my S5 to the S7 The Advanced Wifi feature doesnt work at all 
Dissapointed Easy to use and has good battery life so far calendar on s3 was much better to much bloat ware like Samsung prod I bought it a few weeks ago and Im still figuring everything out I really like the phone tho I got this over a week ago and I cant put it down I love the Galaxy series phones but I believe youve outdone yourselves on the s7 its so easy to use the battery holds a charge like no other phone Ive had  ever Its just a great phone Its  just a cellphone This is the second best phone on the market that I have recently used I briefly had the phone until the battery issue with the Note 7 was worked out Comparing the phone to the Note is probably not really fair so I will try and compare it to the S5 which I had before Compared to the S5 this phone is FAST FAST FAST A big improvement on the memory makes the phone great I also liked the wallpaper shuffle option Nice touch The only problem I had with the design of the phone was screen responsiveness at the edge of the screen I like the idea and look of the Edge design but had a problem using the keyboard if and when the characters on the screen where on the Edge of the screen Other than that if it wasnt for the timing of my phone contract ending soon before the release of the Note 7 I probably would have picked this phone for the duration of a contract Came off the Note 4 to a Note 7 It was unfortunate to have the battery issue however this replacement is excellent Only thing I wish was available was a better tempered glass protector solution The current product available has not been ideal I now protect it with the Zagg HD Dry Its fit is good but I sure like the feel of glass better 
Back to the S7 Edge I love it great features excellent camera and expandable memory Would like to have seen the Octacore in it but the Quad works well I switched to the Galaxy from a Windows phone Id been using for 4 years I have really struggled to make the transition and prefer the other OS over Android by far Of course having a greater selection of apps is nice but those apps are much more confusing to manage notifications off or on etc The camera is noticeably inferior to the one I had and the stock camera program is frustrating What I find is that every app they present you with needs to be replaced with an aftermarket one that meets your expectations but doesnt quite sync well with the phone Ive also noticed I have to click swipe or drag about 40 more to do the same operations I used to do Could some of this be OS switch syndrome Probably but Im returning the device this week as Im thoroughly unimpressed and underwhelmed for the price Im also missing more calls texts and emails than ever and Im tired of explaining that Im still trying to get used to a new phone Ill try the iphone next and hope for the best The 14 day return policy at Verizon is helpful in this regard This is a fun phone to use I like all the ways to customize like when texting you can customize differently for each person you text I also love the Emoji selection  Been with Verizon for awhile works in more places first new phone I cant get over how long the battery lasts Sometimes I go 2 days without charging Everything I imagine from Samsung and more I got this phone as an upgrade from my HTC one best upgrade ever I had a lot of problem with my previous Samsung Alpha phone But ever since I got this phone I have no problem at all I am just happy that I made a worthy decision and it made me a happy customer  Like most people who have never used an Edge device I didnt really see the big deal 

I used to think  so the edges curvethats not useable or beneficial really the screen bezel doesnt really bother me 

Boy was I wrong

The sloped edges of an Edge device may seem like a hollow feature that doesnt really benefit a user  until you use them 

Even disregarding the Edge Panel goodies the sloped edges make the device feel and look more seamless They help with dragging between screens and scrolling They let your content fill the device in ways other phones severely lack

Just one of the nice features lets you set a color to frequent Contacts so that when the device is upside down as we tend to leave it while trying to focus on other things like work and school the edges blink that color when texts and calls come in This may seem dumb but at a glance i can tell if im getting a text from someone important without getting roped into reading it breaking my train of thought and interrupting my studious work

And then theres the Edge Panel  best HUD on a smartphone Seeing Apps Contacts and Widgets without leaving the current app or losing valuable screen space is priceless

And as with all topend Samsung devices the screens are beautiful  better than some Retina displays and most HD offerings Additionally the sound The speakers might not be the beall endall but they get louder than my laptop and sound better  whats more to say

And if youre coming from an IOS device  just wait until you get to use the Android back button a few times Its worth more than any IOS feature could ever hope to be I love my Samsung products My husband has the I phone I couldnt deal with it I love the Android products I love the simplicity of the Samsung pay Great phone and the sound quality is excellent Awesome phone extremely happy with iteasy to use and far ahead of iPhoneevery new model is better than beforeamazing screen and fast charginggreat picturesthanks This phone is great  Very high  tech but with that trademark Samsung ease of use  Love it So far only having this Galaxy S7 a week Im very happy with it Yes Ive had to install the video player app since theyve inexplicably not included it but thats not a big deal I love the inclusion of a graphic equalizer the improved camera and the new ability to plugin a flash drive with the included adapter I wish they had kept the removable battery layout The socalled rapid charger is not rapid at all taking roughly the same amount of time to charge as my old Galaxy S5 and as with the S5 it gets uncomfortably hot during charging updating or shooting long videos Im glad that they kept the micro SD card option as its a dealmaker for me I would definitely recommend this phone I used to have an iPhone but after switching to the Galaxy S5 and now the S7 I will never have another iPhone This simply devours the iPhone I like the larger screen than on my little mini smart phone This one also has a better camera which I seem to use quite often Dont even take my old good camera with me anymore So far I love everything about this phoneexcept one problem In some apps and sites the spot to touch is right on the top or bottom of the curve of the screen The position makes it hard to click on the area Maybe increased sensitivity in that area could help Had the galaxy S4 before this and wife had S5 but now we both have S7 Great phone so far and its only been about a month The only complaint I have right now is that the headphone jack is on the bottom which makes me have to put phone upside down in pocket at the gym and this phone doesnt let the screen rotate upside down It will rotate sideways both directions but it does not go upside down 
The battery charger plugs into bottom and headphone jack so you cant really stand your phone up while its charging My galaxy S4 had no problem rotating upside down
Other than that so far its a great phone
They also changed the email program We used to be able to select all emails by the date they arrived or by the week This made it easy to get rid of junk mail for the day Now you have to select them all at once or one by one Can be quite time consuming Being a professional Educational Leader and a college student I chose this device to meet my needs for studies work and a little personal play time This Device allows me to work from anywhere I can read emails edit documents and return them all using this device I utilize four accounts so I juggle through those accounts all day long the Note 7 allows me to do this easily where other phones have had issues I can even write my homework on the device and submit to my professor I have used this device as a mini computer and it has not let me down I am excited to see the accessories that will be compatible with this device Samsung has made me a believer My first time using android software  the galaxy s7 edge is great Love the size and weight Love the Edge screen and features the ease of use and its durability including the moisture proof capability What is not to love Great display Not made for large hands but still a great phone Easy to learn Had the S5 this is a greatreplacement I swapped my recalled Note 7 for this phone I must say aside from the lack of SPen and blue light filter the phones were nearly identical Great features love the Edge screens the Smart Switch app is awesome and made setting up my phone a breeze since it practically did it for me exactly as my other phone was done Im a Note girl through and through so I did swap back when the replacement Note 7s came available but I wouldnt have been too heartbroken to be stuck with the S7 Edge if they never got around to fixing the Note I was issued the s7 edge as a loaner while I waited for my note 7 replacement I have to tell you I was close to just accepting the loaner as my new phone It is fast and responsive The water proof element is huge for me as well Overall you cannot go wrong with this phote Very good phone easy to use I got the S7 edge to replace my aging S5 This phone is awesome Loaded with lots of features Great pictures Battery gets hot when fast charging or during Android updates Ive never had a phone break on me But I bought a wrap around case from verizon for it and dropped it 2 feet on accident onto my wood floor and the phone got huge spider web cracks all over it 

Super disappointed in the quality The note 7 I replaced it with has really strong sapphire glass that hasnt broken for any reason Although Im not happy that the replacement phone I received was  defective I am happy so far with switching from LG to Samsung I just upgraded from a  S3 and love all the great features of my S7 Its easy to use and lots of storage Just like the s5 more Emory better camera Doing a bit of research youll find that despite the release of the Galaxy Note 7 and iPhone 7 the processor for the s7 and s7 Edge still clocks top speeds of any consumer phone on the market Good set of features finger print is getting better All glass body is as you would expect a finger print magnet and easily damaged being the one main downside of the phone Display is 25k hd extremely crisp and very bright for as little power as it consumes and the Always On feature extends the already impressive battery life into nearly2daysbeforechargeisneeded realm All in all A quality phone if a little pricey This phone has been fantastic It does everything well The camera snaps photos extremely fast and extremely clear I also love that it is water resistant We have taken some really cool pictures with it The phone is also easy enough to use that my dad actually had me order one for him The phone is snappy and does everything well You will not be disappointed with this phone i just love this phone is quick its light  bright i would recommend this phone to all I really like my S7 edge easy to use great looking  battery lasts a long time  love the curved screen and edge pullouts I love samsung i have always has samsung products i have a tv fridge washer dryer phone tablet watch head hophen have alot of them and will swear by them I just got this phone after have Iphones for years I have to say I like everything about it I like that the screen is largerthat basically all the apps are freeincluding navigation I like the ease with using the phone and the ease of movement between tasks Great overall phone This is my third GalaxyS I would encourage anyone to own this phone Much better batt life then my s5 faster and the screen is pretty nice I do miss the ir blaster and wish the camera was a Lititle better my wifes lg v10 has a much nicer camera and I honestly wanted the note 7 but needed a phone and couldnt wait S7 does not automatically pair with car as S4 did  Subaru recognizes phone but I have to go to settings and connect it that way every time I start the car  Is a gross pain in the neck I like the slimness of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and features This phone is the perfect size and feels great in the hand like a old smooth bar of soap 
It comes with Android Marshmallow which I also like 
It is powerful smooth and overall a classy phone 
I dont utilize the Edge features much but I like the edge to edge display and the fact that the screen is larger 
The camera is fantastic and is much better than the Note 4 that it replaced and has much better low light performance 
I hated to put a case on it but I found a good low profile one and an excellent wet application screen saver and its almost as good as the bare phone 
Wish it was less expensive 
Overall very giddy I like it I received this phone as a temporary replacement for the Note 7 I found it to be sluggish and underpowered in comparison I was very happy when the replacement Note 7s were released This is my first Samsung and my first Android phone So far its been a blast for the first week Its going to take me little while longer to get comfortable but time is what I have Love the features compared to my previous phones in the past 10yrs Love the phone just wish it had better battery life on not glass all the way around but works great takes beautiful pictures love it has removable stroage phone is better than iPhone 6 I had before The screen is amazing clear and crisp The camera takes amazing pictures I love the wireless charging It is a fast phone in that programs work quickly It is a small yet very powerful phone The whole design is so very clean and slick it looks awesome The resolution is beautiful and the camera shoots like a charm Only one thing how do I get my free memory chip I love my s7 edge Great display fast performance modern look and solid feel So many things to tweak and play with on this phone I dont even know where to start 

My only complaint is that it only have 32gb internalsure I can use the micro SD slot but I personally just like having the space on the phone itself 

I would like the option to have adoptable storage when we get the Android N update I love my Samsung S7 It is a great smartphone Coming from a nexus 6 I wish there was less preinstalled apps and the ability to switch defaults for clock and calendar Performance display and responsiveness is excellent I really like my Samsung phones Its the only phone I buy My Galaxy s7 Edge broke So I had them replace it with the Galaxy s7 For me it was a better fit The size is perfect The only thing with the s7 is battery Seems to drain faster then my other phone But I love this one It was perfect for me I have been a long time Samsung user starting with the Galaxy Nexus and with each iteration of the Galaxy line Samsung continues to improve and make the phone the absolutely best available The ergonomics of the phone is just amazing It fits so comfortably in the hand and does not feel like a phone with a 55 screenand the screen is stunning in its rich color and exceptional contrast I use my phones camera for lots and lots of picture taking and this camera is amazing I am forever sold on Samsung products This is an excellent phone I really liked it a lot I had to return my note 7 and got one of these If it would have had a stylus I would have kept it I really like everything about this phone I havent found a negative yet Ease of use easy to navigate certainly plenty of features and having only had it for a couple of weeks Im still finding out new and exciting things about it

I would have given this 5stars across the board if it had come with a stylus like the other Samsung models For some reason the only way to get a fine point stylus with a hard tip is to buy a product that comes with one I hate the wide smooshytipped styluses that are for sale on the general market If you could add one of those it would be a 5star plus phone in my book

Thanks for a great phone Samsung I got the edge 7 as a temporary replacement for my Note 7 I was surprised by how much I liked the device It feels great in the hand has nice performance and still works with the Samsung VR Its a bit smaller than the Note7 and fits well in the hand and pocket I have loved every Samsung product I have ever owned The s7 was a temporary replacement phone while i waited to replace my note7 It was a great phone Easy to navigate Tons of awesome features I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a smart phone So this was my replacement after my recall of my note 7 And I have to say Im glad I have switched to it Its much more comfortable in my hand Coming from a galaxy s4 this is by far the best phone Ive owned Samsung consistently makes a great product This phone is well built with an outstanding display The camera is the best on the market The phone has a beautiful overall design and feels comfortable to hold Keep up the great work Samsung Perfect size to read with lots of options to make font larger I enjoy all the memory available and the awesome battery life The speakers are great for a phone and it wasnt difficult to move information from my old Samsung phone to my new phone I have really found that Samsungs customer service is one of the best across all its products I buy their televisions phones tablets because of their commitment to product quality It came with the mind blowing VR gear which was awesome It was an amazing promotional incentive Thank you We both bought the new phone after looking at the I phone Great product glad I bought one Had I Gotten this phone first it would have been all 5s but I just prefer the features and design of the note7 over this Its still a great phone and really liked the battery life Best ever that Ive had Always had galaxy phones this one is better and faster than my five Upgraded to the S7 recently Overall great piece of technology my compliments Although some changes werent exactly an improvement in my opinion  Many inconveniences needing a tool to access the SIM and memory cards not being able to remove the back cover not being able to rotate through the home and subsequent screens I am really happy with my phone I have had the s7 two weeks and not satisfied with the s7 at all tomuch phone for my use Forget iPhone quality Android is the way to go Samsung brings it The screen is larger 
than last years phone but it doesnt feel too much bigger in your hand The rear of the phone is curved to making it feel great in your hand Its waterproof It has a Micro SD card slot It has a lot of power The battery is better than last years battery and the phone lasts over 24 hours between charges In my view the phone is worth every penny This is my third Samsung phone and its an awesome product and well made I used Galaxy years ago and when I upgraded to the S7 I discovered a whole new world of mobile communications I would recommend this phone to family and friends I went from a note 4 to the s7 I was concerned about the size at first  After a few days and a case the smaller size is much easier to contain at work Love this phone I traded in my S5 for this phone  While it has some improvements they arent enough to make up for the SHORT battery life Overall I wish I had looked at some of the other phones I really like my new S7 was easy to setup and for the most part it is a definite upgrade over my Motorola Ultra But the power button is just on the wrong side I use it in my car often and loading into my car mount it there is now way to avoid hitting the power button so a couple of times it has shut off 

So that minor irritation happens two or three times a day hoping in and out of the car 

Best feature is the camera and the pull down list to see previews of your messages I rwally enjoy the features of this phone however there are some downsides the battery does not last as long as advertised and my signal strength and connection strength is not as strong on this phone as it was with my galaxy s5 Its a nice phone just not sure its worth the price Im still learning I must say though that it is quite difficult to transfer contacts and calendars to the new phone But I guess that doesnt have to do with the phone itself Just got this phone but Iveven already discovered that it is used friendly and even takes good pics Love the LONG battery life I had another brand that drained within hours and had to rechargeif needed this would go 2 days before needing a recharge  the phone is great Like it so much I get a one for my wife the next day and plan on getting a note 7in a couple of weeks Love my Samsung galaxy S7 edge I dropped and my screen got damaged First smart phone and the best in the market what can I say more Flying in the clouds I had this phone for only 3 weeks while I was waiting for the replacement Note 7 It was fantastic If it had a stylus I would have kept it Beautiful screen and lightning fast performance And the apps Wow The phone is really nice thus far Its much faster than my old one and I like the features I switched from a Motorola Droid Razr which I had for many years This is my first Samsung I love the drop down quick access menu that allows you to turn on and off the different features of the phone Very pleased with the ease of the camera and clarity of the pictures What Ive come to like about Samsung over the last few years since the S5 is they dont change for the sake of change What I mean by this is that they are continuously improving the function and feel of the devices With fast wireless charging and the return of IP cert and SD cards the only thing I can complain about is the lack of typec but at the time typec was getting bad press so I understand the decision to forgo it Faster than the s6 for sure
I think the double edge screen is useless without a cover as your hands might trip the screen
Screen resolution and colors are awesome
Camera is great Battery life as well
I would have loved one sided edge or a straight phone with the same screen and specs This is hands down the best phone I have owned I previously had a Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S6 I didnt think they could top the S6 but they did Having a SD Card slot to store music photos and more is fantastic Like previous Samsung phones quality is just unmatched Samsung never disappoints me I had the first galaxy phone for a while before upgrading to the s5 and the only reason I upgraded so quickly to the s7 is being able to use samsung pay Its worth it I love being able to pay with my phone The camera is great too Being able to shoot in low light was another reason I upgraded Im also really excited to get my VR gear and really fall in love with my phone I have really enjoyed this phone so far I will continue to update if i find any other cons Thought battery life would be better Not any better then my old Galaxy4s Great features great styling awesome HD screen just fantastic I am one of the Note  recall ordeal Was originally a little disappointed when I had to return my Note 7 but no longer Absolutely love the S7 edge and dont miss the note taking ability because I can do the same thing on the S7 Edge with Samsung note Gonna stick with my S7 Edge even when they are ready to replace the Note Good phone but seems like it is just like the galaxy so 6 edge Seems as though it was just a new name put in the phone However its great Love the display and camera The camera is outstanding on this device I love the wireless charging it makes it quick and easy The vr is really amazing The phone is fast and the battery lasts a long time before you have to charge it again I am a retired Engineer from ATT and I haave experienced several phones and the Samsung Galaxy series outshines them all in my opinion The design the feel of the phone the battery life the apps the speed and especially the memory card capability This is a great phone It charges super fast and stays alive all day allowing you to do whatever you want on your phone all day There are a couple cons to this product It is hard to hold with 2 hands much less 1 hand because of the edges It is super touchy so you find yourself having to close out apps you didnt intend on opening There are a few bugs that need to be worked out but I would definitely recommend this product for a friend Great upgrade lots of features I probably wont ever need I wish I could have just kept my 4 because it had things the 7 doesnt  I do think the camera and video on the 7 will be nicer Got it a few days ago I love it Great camera tons of features fast Internet and 32 GB storage Best phone Ive ever owned I am so happy with my Galaxy S7 Edge I love this phone S7 edge is really nice smartphone it has became a part of my day to day buddy to go Battery life is really wonderful and it has withstood for more than a day for my above average usage Phone is really worth the price Bought a month ago  Phone is nice I started off with Samsung galaxies when I got phones then switched to and LG because it was cheaper than the S7 I absolutely hated the LG but couldnt afford to upgrade  Well when it was time for upgrade I finally got the S7 I love it its the best galaxy so far The apps are easy to use and the phone is easy to navigate This phone is amazing with its wireless charging vr and many other things I cant think of on the top of my head The best part about me getting this phone is everything because I had been using the Samsung Galaxy s3 since it has released and this is a HUGE jump from performance and quality Had to temporarily switch from the note 7 to the galaxy s7 edge due to the recall The battery does not last half as Long as the note does so took some time to get used to that Nor doess it charge as fast But overall if your not into a note this would be the next best thing I love the edge screen have had it since it came out I absolutely love all my Samsung products they interact well together and upgrading is simple My new S7 is simple to use fast and i love all the new features Frankly I dont get the less than favorable reviews that are out there on the Galaxy S7 I use my phone frugally in the sense that I turn off what I am not using dont overload it with apps and media dont toss it on the ground into dirt water or sand Oh yes and I keep it covered with a good bumper case and screen protector As a result I thoroughly enjoy the bright screen the snappy performance the excellent design and especially the voice clarity of the actual phone calls that my old Galaxy S3 lacked I still use a conventional camera to take photos but the phone is great for spontaneous snapshots I have no connection issues although the WiFi is not as strong as my IPhone 6 plus but it doesnt matter What matters is that it easily connects to any WiFi and Bluetooth device that I have Its a really nice size for pocketing the fingerprint reader is fast and efficient the menu system and access to features are easy to navigate and because I budget the phones energy I get reasonably good battery life Every so often an app will glitch but that happens on the iPhone too There is nothing not to like about the S7 bought a month ago still cant figure how to do everything I traded my galaxy note 4 in for the galaxy 7 big mistake my note 4 was a lot easier to navigate and use I cant stand this one unfortunately Im out of my return period Ive been trying to like it and use it but I seriously feel I made a huge mistake in trading I would highly recommend this phone Samsung always has great products I traded in the GS4 for this phone so thats what Im comparing it to Of course the GS4 allowed for a battery change if needed and added storage The camera on the 7 is clearly better very nice I love the fact that it is waterproof  dustproof Unfortunately I was expecting a longer battery life with a brand new phone because my GS4 was 4 12 years old I was wrong The battery is about the same and maybe even a little worse with this new phone When I talk to Verizon customer service they said that is true that battery lives are getting shorter on smartphones although the ads say battery life is longer The worst thing about this phone is the way the alarms work I use it as my alarm clock in the morning and keep it muted This phone will not have an audible alarm if the phone is muted What a horrible design I dont want to be woken in the night by text andor notifications thats why its on mute But when I need the alarm to ring I need it to be loud Very very disappointing The gs4 worked perfectly for that I misses it This galaxy disappointed me in that the camera freezes up it times out if it doesnt recognize my fingerprint it flops from one program to another without my direction I liked the galaxy 6 better Not happy with phone Small and battery life is not good I love the7s edge The quick response is very impressive I tried to go back to the iphone6 when my upgrade was due I lasted 2 days and returned it for my Samsung IPhone is basic phone is not 12 as efficient and use full as a Samsung The edge is sleek and sexy I love to use it I like it over the note the edge is thinner longer and easier to handle for small hands 

I rarely used the stylus so I dont mind not having it at all The EDGE has got my vote all over it I got the phone two weeks ago and I like the speed the ease of the applications and the ability to modify all the settings to make it more of my personality the downside is the call reception is poor compared to my last phone the Samsung Galaxy S4 Went from the S5 to the new S7nice upgrade  Get it when you can Im not very technically inclined however this phone is so easy to use It fits nice in my back pants pocket too  Transitioning to the 7 from a 4 was so easy Small and easy to use I highly recommend this phone Very fast sleek design The only phone I use is Samsung love the features the light weight of it would definitely recommend it to others I bought this to replace my old phone and it is a working perfectly so far Im an Apple convert Love it other than not having iTunes on the phone I can live with it but android needs a really good music app like Apple has Great phone great camera nice to be able and add an SD card Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is I feel it could have a better battery life After a day of sporadic use the battery is down to 50 I love the Galaxy 6 Love the features and ease of use This has definitely been my favorite cell phone so far Easy to use great camera and battery life it does everything I need and then some A wonderful upgrade from the s4 The screen is brighter and the features are very easy to use Not to mention the doubled storage space is a huge plus I am waiting for my Note 7 to come back I like the Spen and note taking feature Beautiful design but performance was buggy froze at times and the bloatware made the phone frustratingly inoperable I had to reset the phone to make the music app stop I have had many Samsung products many phones I still have a Laptop They are very good dependable This is my first time with this type of phone I Love it 
Its bright and clear easy to type text messages or even this review It seems user friendly I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new phone Normally my favorite Galaxy S would have been the S5 but this beats it by a mile Premium design with the glass and metal and the curved screen is perfect Not too drastic like on the S6 Samsung really hit the nail on the head with this device Ill randomly find a new feature or something fancy on my phone Im very glad I went with the galaxy S7 I went over the reviews on the S7 edge that I originally wanted and I know that Ive made the right choice Hopefully everyone is as pleased as I am with there galaxy S7 Always loved Samsung phones there are no exceptions here This phone is amazing The S7 was the loaner phone I received during the voluntary recall of the Note 7 The S7 edge is a really robust phone in terms of performance and its overall look As a Note user I thought I would be disappointed because I use my phone not only for my personal enjoyme t but for work also The S7 did a great job keeping up to my demands I missed the Spen and the size and functionality of the Note I would suggest the S7 Edge for a moderate user who wants to take pictures who may use their phone on occasion for work I was pleased with the S7 Edge Samsung has the best phones hands down Ive had my phone for about a month and cant stop talking about it I originally thought I wouldnt like it as it was much larger than my older phone I found that the sizef the phone was not that noticeable as the phone is much slimmer The camera on the Samsung is outstanding Everyday I find some new feature that I cant wait to show someone else what my phone can do Still getting use to it Has some features Im not familiar with yet I love this phone and very happy with all of the features and the design of it is awesomeThe features on the phone is so awesome and easy to use The only one flaw that this phone has is the speakers suck  Everything Im looking for a phone is here but the cons is about the speaker Not good when using for sounds Using headset while on music is great I had the s6 edge and this is by far the best phone I have ever had Love Samsung products I like the new improved apps and options for the edge screen I bought 4 S7 Edge devices I am currently on my 3rd device 1st one battery problems major battery problems 2nd one just constantly reset itself regardless of what you were doing with it and the current one is doing both The device gets real hot then resets itself I am extremely disappointed in the edge 7 and if I could get something different without paying an arm and a leg I would Totally disappointed This is a great phone in so many ways I have use this device really is making me more productive in work and home affairs As much as I like this phone I am really am more intriged by the Note 7 I will be going out to pick up the Note 7 this coming weekend Love my Samsungs This is my third Galaxy in several years The features are great but most importantly the phone itself is reliable attractive and easy to use Will not hesitate to continue getting Galaxys Wish I could have tried it out Thought the Camara would be better Still think there is more to it Guess I will figure it out Inow time I bought it a week ago and have found that its been easier to set up than previous ones Ive had in the past The only thing is it disconnects from the wireless too often More than my S5 did I have been a Samsung fan since day 1 of the original I would have to say anything and everything that you all do to continue to develop these awesome machines keep doing it Your making them right this phone is working 100 times better than the LG phone I had Faster than my old s5 and I have the same apps Great processor Not enough to phone to hold always touching the screen None of the features of the note 7 I love this phone The only thing I would add is a direct dial button on the home screen for calling people without having to search through contacts I love my phone Samsung is the Best when it comes to electronics wouldnt buy anything else I have had my new phone for a week and am liking the upgrade I had an S5 which I loved but the processor couldnt keep up anymore Transferring everything was super easy I didnt even need instructions just connected the phones  began Love the size love where the power button is I dont dislike having the audio jack on the bottom since I use my aux cord a lot more than my headphones My only complaint is where the mic is I tended to cover it with my finger and thought I had a defective phone before I realized what the issue was The quality of the pictures and other features are much more advanced than the S5 I bought this phone a few weeks and Im not impressed The battery life is poor Even though Ive turned off everything I can And the creek is pretty small I like the clear photos and love that I can personalize my phone with back ground font or the lock that requires my finger print  Had a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that my battery overheated on and damaged the phone Replaced with the S7 First time Ive ever needed to replace or had an issue with Samsung phone Love the wireless charging built in and all the great features Only two weeks into use and Im very pleased with my decision to go with the new S7 Massive upgrade from my S4 Always loved the galaxy series Ive own many smartphones Samsung galaxy S7 edge is by far the best phone have ever used Had to get this phone because of issues with my S6 but huge improvement from the last model

Battery life is 10 times better Lasting pretty much all day even with heavy use
Better feel in the hands Beautiful display Love the camera and expandable memory Love that its water resistance

I dont use the edge features to often Maybe Ill find a use for them 

Very durable I havent had a case on it since I got it I did manage to crack the screen when trying to fix a flat tire and it slipped out my pocket but I can barely see the crack and it hasnt gotten bigger or began to peel off

Does run really hot sometimes but other than that no major issues Ive been an iPhone guy ever since but when I got my S7 man I couldnt take it off my hand I love taking pictures with it and the phones display is just superb Great job Samsung You finally made me switch to an android I have always loved Samsung products and was coming from a Samsung S2 which I bought in 2011 It is amazing the longevity their products have and I hope to have this phone for another 5 years It is a beautiful piece of technology and is built with the highest quality 
 Customization and performance are very important and the S7 has both I can tweak every tiny setting and do all my tasks crazy fast I love the s7 I love the split screen capability One thing Ive always loved about the galaxy line is the easy customizability of it You caneed download different themes for the phones apps and system in general Love my Galaxy Good battery life Easy to use I wouldnt even consider another brand Grateful to have the S7 This camera and screen are so clear It is amazing This phone eliminates the need for large digital cameras At least for daily use I hate this phone The battery never lasts and it gets extremely hot when charging Easy to use  Like the size Am glad I switched to Galaxy 7 done it again love the look  product would purchase This is for the GS7  NOT the edge

Love the customization features of this phone if there is something that I dont like about a current configuration there is some way for me to go in and change it to make it the way I like I also love the options and themes that keep the layout of the phone looking new whenever you want a different look The waterproof aspect is incredibly convenient as well I love the function of the back button and the display all windows buttons The added feature to be able to display multiple apps in one window is very useful

While I do love the phone I do have critiques While i do appreciate the aesthetic appeal of the curved glass screen I think that it does more harm than good This being so because almost all users put cases on their phones and once this is done it takes away that sleek look that the curved glass offers even with the GS7 Also Im reading that its difficult to make a tempered glass screen protector for the phone When I had my S5 I kept a tempered glass protector on it broke the screen protector several times but the phone screen always stayed in tact Now that the edges curve on the GS7 all of the tempered glass protectors stop at the beginning of the curve and then you cant use the last 1mm or so of your screen which happens more often than you might think As a result I am not using a screen protector and have already shattered the glass once I encourage Samsung to come out with a protector that can adhere to the curved edges of the S7 and S7 edge

Ive also noticed that the phone gets pretty hot sometimes 

Everything else though is great and I am in love with the phone This is one of the best phone I have hadi would recommend my friends to own on of this phone The note 7 was recalled I traded it out for this galaxy s7 edge with the thought that Id go back in for the Note 7 after it was available again Im not going back Im loving this phone Its super fast and the size is great Its a keeper love this phone best ever Samsung is so advanced i made VR videos on my vacation and viewing real life in virtual reality is so fun So far so good  Battery life decent and works very fast  Very strong feel Im still learning my phone Love it a lot Wish the phone was a little bigger This is a great upgrade for us The transfer of data from our older cell to our new cell was uneventful Mine dies before 7 months Pixels went out Lost photos that couldnt be replaced because they came off my previous phone that I had for years Yes they replaced it but shouldnt have had to I am more than just upset with this phonewish I never bought it Finally change from a flip phone to a smart phone Perfect design perfomance so handle the best smartphone I must say the phone is a great phone by Design and software Ive been using it for a while and I must say I love it it feels great in your hands I love the curved design battery life on its real good and the screen looks awesome overall this is a very good phone I would recommend it to my family and friends or basically anybody very happy with it Ive been a Samsung user from day one and recommend them every chance I get Never had a problem and the battery life is great on my S7 Its evident you get what you pay for I have always liked the Samsung phones and their design of their phones I recently upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S5 because I just wore it out but its lasted be for over 2 years with no problems So far this S7 is great Takes GREAT pictures I dont have anything negative to say about it yet Ive had it for about 3 weeks now I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone I am a long time user of Samsung and this is by far the best phone yet East to use great looking and I love the edge features I personally like a Note Series phone I can not stand not having a pen I had the S7 Edge as a loaner I did not like it however it is a galaxy and i love them I was very careful with the phone and still got a weird linescratch on the screen in less than a week I thought this was indestructible gorilla glass  The Edge screen constantly kept getting in the way when I went to flip pages it would open I did not like that the NEW S7 does not use the new USB C charging plug I have owned a few phones for the past few years and so far the s7 Edge was the best I had The design is great the curved edges makes the phone have a beautiful display I have dropped the phone a few times and not a single scratch was imported on it The only problem I had was one app crashes but I use it a lot so that could explain it Overall this phone is a great phone and I would recommend it to a friend Still learning everything this phone can do This phone is by far my best Samsung yet I have owned all the galaxy phone but the s7 edge is sleek stylish and easy to use I can do everything I want right at my fingertips Switched from S6 that failed to 7 not much difference in phones This is by far the best phone I have bought and I am always satisfied with all Samsung products I absolutely love this phone its user friendly like the world at your fingertips I am a note person and I love the s pen the note has other than that its a great phone This thing does everything I want and more probably more than I need what else can I say its a Samsung people Ive been a Samsung fan since my S2 years ago
This phone rocks no lag at all Great reception in calls SD card long battery life fast charging Make sure you get a case this gorilla glass is slick I learn something new with it weekly Ive only had the phone for one day and its a bit clunkier to use than I thought it would be but that might just be because I need to get used to it So far I like it overall The phone will freeze up while typing Ive owned it for about 5 months now and had to send it in for the ear speaker vibrating like a blown speaker Great cusromer service by the way The speaker frequently sounds like a bad connection when I make calls Even to my VM Ill have to hang up and call back sometimes twice before I get a clear call The antenna reception has been bad since I got it Everyone I talk to says your breaking up I cant hear you This happens all over the place Never had a cell phone with this bad reception Always been with the same carrier with all brands of phones Ive owned My first smartphone was an S3 and I loved it I tried another brand after that but now Im back because Samsung has great stuff I was not disappointed The phone is great in its own right and the new features  especially VR  make it well worth it I think it is a good device because is fast the best camera on the market and a bright and good colors on the screen also im amazed with the battery performance Exquisite  Madness  Twice Classy EMC2 Speechless I have had 3 galaxy phones An s3 an s5 and an s7 I have liked every one of them and my s7 is by far my favorite It seems like the phones get better and better It has a lot of features and is easy to use I would recommend it to anyone I got the S7 edge as a loaner device for my N7I was please wthe device however i really miss my Note phnbeen a Note user since the Note 1as of 92016 i am once again proud owner of the new and improve battery operated N7 im all  My only hangup with this phone is that Samsung did not put in an IR transmitter I had an S4 for 3 12 years and used my phone as a remote almost daily I actually considered taking my S7 back for refund 

I kept my old S4 and it is sitting in my living room I use it for my TV Sound bar and for my Roku Works great and does everything I need it to Love the wireless fast charging I have always loved the Galaxy phones From the physical design to the interface this phone is above and beyond its competitors This was a great phone I got it as a loaner as i was waiting for the new note 7 to come out It is almost just like the note but I little smaller I have had a few phones in my life other than the Samsung Galaxy family and I have to say that all of those phones do not add in any way to Samsung Galaxy series People do not realize the vast array of options these phones give the user Compared to an iPhone Galaxy phones are more customizeable Iphones are just a set outline that you have to work within With Galaxies you can make the phone fit your needs so every Galaxy phone is unique Love my Galaxy s7 edge and forever will stay loyal to Samsung The camera is awesome I dished my regular camera and when I go on vacation all I take now is my Galaxy Edge 7
The great thing is that I can keep all my vacation pictures in the SD card Nice phone fast response time with every touchwater resistant has great picture quality So first Ill start out saying I went from apple to my first ever Samsung phone and well due to certain issues had to return and get a temporary phone 

The temp phone is the s7 edge I am in no way a fan of the phone I think the screen is to curved At least for my liking and i eas already having issues as soon as they gave it to me 

The phone was overheating with use and charging which made me nervous given the note 7 issue Ive only had it a few weeks and already issues 

I would not ever go back to that phone Thats not to say its not a good phone just not for me I orefer the note 7 or a good ole IPhone Samsung has done well with design of this phone Wish it was a little more rugged A metal or sturdy back instead of glass would have been perfect I do not do formal reviews I stated the phone was great what else do you need I recently purchased this phone after using a galaxy s4 for years I enjoy the larger battery and speedy charging speeds on the s7 edge it is great not needing to carry a battery pack around if I need juice at work I just plug it in fast charge is awesome and quickly gets your phone back up to full power or a little boost in 1520 minutes to allow you to get through the day

I passed on the s6 due to it not having an sd card slot I am glad I waited because I got the sd card slot and water resistance I often go fishing and have my phone in my vest with my old phone I needed it in a case to avoid getting wet with the s7 edge I need not worry because of the water resistance Im so happy that I upgraded from the S4 to the S7 The display is so much clearer I love the low light camera Its also faster Excellent phone no issues I had the note 7 and had to exchange the note 7 due to a battery issue and chose the Samsung S7 Edge as a replacement As stated the Samsung S7 Edge is a great phone yet Im going to exchange the S7 Edge with the revised Note7 because I like the larger screen and I like and use the stylus 

The entire Samsung line up of phones are great Me Im a Note fan When first heard of this samsung galaxy s7 edge I though to my self it will be my next phone I like the design of the phone and all text features in the phone very helpful stuff the camera is best camera I ever seen so far I had iPhone but this nothing compared to the I phone I suggest this phone to my friends and family  Love everything about this phone However I do feel as though my Note 4 was much faster I love my galaxy s7 edge top three reasons battery life is great I dont have to worry about water anymore design cutting edge Replaced my S6
Love it After a few years of using a basic phone and dragging around an old iPod Touch for my musicapp needs I decided to take the plunge and get a smart phone Originally I was going to get an iPhone 6S because my music was all organized through iTunes and Im a bit OCD about that sort of thing so I figured itd be easier to go with an Apple phone 
Well the guy at the Verizon store convinced me to get the Galaxy S7 Edge instead Im pretty happy with this decision The phone is hugely customizable and looks great The display is beautiful the processor is very fast and thanks to the microSD promotion it has plenty of space for all of my musicwhich I found an app that syncs my phone to iTunes with minimal hassle
Battery life is alright Could be worse could be better Compared to similar phones its longer lasting than most If you use your phone away from an outlet for long periods of time during the day getting a battery pack might be a good option for you Im usually pretty alright throughout the day 
Great phone overall I think Ill be a Samsung user for the foreseeable future My first smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy S4 my second is the S7 After purchasing this phone we went  bought the book so I wouldnt accidentally delete anything important I wish someone wouldve gone over all the apps included IN phone but it was fun discovering them 

I really enjoy the way the Amazon Google Samsung  Verizon folder buttoms are done All their files are in one place You push their button  all the files available come up I also like the Galaxy Essentials apps for your Galaxy And for the Pokemon Go theres an option for help to slow down the drain on your battery

Anyway I Very pleased with this phone Thanks for much Cant wait to see the next ones My wife and I went from iPhones to the new Samsung S7 Edge phoneswe absolutely love themwhat a change They both work wonderfulwe will never go back to iPhone By far the best phone I ever had water resistant beautiful screen everything looks clear and beautiful 
In my opinion best phone in the matket very fast Builtin speakers  Realistic color and Bright display Connectivity camera screen display size and weight beyond perfect I would like to start off with the pros great cameralove the look and the feeling of the phone The phone is really easy to use and is overall a grate phone Now the cons The very first day I received the phone set it up did all the upgrades available I noticed the phone warming up So removed all the preinstalled games and apps except Facebook The phone got hot to the touch so removed Facebook and it was fine A week later with only 6 installed apps the screen started freezing amd moving up and down when trying to use the text app and wouldnt turn off until after it stopped Outside of those few things no other problems Battery seems great getting used to the new features sharp colors Ive owned many Samsung devices in the past and was hesitant on the edge model Im glad I took the chance because the edge features are amazing With the edge it makes it faster to get to additional apps without all of the scrolling The ability to add a memory card is great and with it being waterproof is a definite plus If there are any negatives I had to pick it would be that the speaker could be louder Overall the S7 seems to be everything I need in a smartphone From having great durability  while being very accessible it is a quality product Im quite pleased with 

The biggest features Im very satisfied with would have to be the battery life and customisable features that help make the smartphone truly my own

The only thing I miss from older generation smartphones is the simplicity is no longer there but it is well worth the sacrafice Love this phone It has no flaws the only thing I hate about it is that it only came with one  Absolutely perfect phone for any person meets all my needs  more best phone ever Best phone I have ever used Great battery life and amazing camera I recently upgraded from my previous Galaxy S4 and this is a huge step up The camera takes wonderful pictures the battery last much longer even with the alwayson display enabled and my heavy use I actually like that the form factor was reduced slightly I dont notice it with respect to screen size but onehanded operation is much easier than with the S4 I love the idea that its waterproof but Im still too afraid to test it This phone is everything and more of what I wanted Please keep supporting the updates I absolutely love this phone its extremely responsive and has no lag what so ever as far as I can tell I miss the Note 7s features this Galaxy Edge 7 reminds me of an off brand knockoff  It does offer a lot of really great apps but not the features I had grown to love in the Note series If I could have waited for who knows how long I wouldve waited for the 7 Note issues to be fixed then exchanged for it instead of the 7 Edge I absolutely love my phone I initially got a note 7 but after the recall I traded for a s7 edge I love it I am going back to the note 7 because its a bigger phone and thats my favorite I do love this phone though I had Samsung Galaxy beforebut the options you get with this is just brings you to the 21st century With the split screen options and so many more it never ends You think you have a mini computerbecause of all the things you can do at the same time Almost switched to this phone originally but really like the features of the Note7 including the larger display and Spen capabilities This a great phone just wish it had more device memory like the note 7 its everything you can want in a phone without the s pen and more device memory and it all depends on how you use your phone But great and fun phone
Thanks This was my loaner while waiting for Note7 replacement The phone worked great and would be my choice if I didnt get the Note I like the Spen so sticking with the Note I knocked down on design due to the position of the power button Being almost directly across from volume button means Im always hitting both sides whether Im trying to adjust volume or turn of the screen I also tend to touch the edge screens inadvertently due to the narrow size On the note it didnt seem to happen as much this is my 3rd samsung galaxyjust keeps getting better I have owned samsung Saturday and note phones ever since I have had wireless service and by far the S7 has a 5 star rating with me the speed is super fast the graphics are excellent and I like how the phone is water resistant up to 5 feet for 30 minutes The Galaxy S7 Edge is quite simply the best phone Ive ever owned The processor is quick and responsive the camera is amazing and the screen is better than anything else out there I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7  I love it It gets hot when charging other than that its a good phone Switched from Motorola to Samsung Id always been an iphone person up until a few weeks ago when I bought the S7 Edge What a great phone Filled with features the right size not bulky fast and you can put a memory card in it
The edge feature is particularly helpful This is the one of the best phones out there besides the note 7 It has so many features I dont even know what to do with it sometime My favorite part is probably the edge feature Over all the phone is nice Happy that I didnt get the Note 7 
Only issue I have was the same I had with my galaxy s5 the soundringtones and notifications still plays through the phone speak when a Bluetooth is connected One of the purposes of the Bluetooth headset it to not disturb others around you when you get a call or notification I am on call at night and I need my phone notifications to wake me up through the night without waking my entire family I tried sleeping with the Bluetooth headset on thinking the sound only played through the headset only but I was wrong and it woke up my my wife and all my kids at 2 am The kids didnt go back to sleep right away so neither did the wife 
Please fix this I feel this is a really big issue and needs to be addressed The picture and speed of this phone are great Its very lightweight also The lasting time of this phone is impressive and lasting Just bought a Galaxy S7 after my S4 which was 3 years old finally gave out The phone is similar in size and weight to the old model and aesthetically is about the same Mounted it in an Otter case with protective screen Looks very nice Layout via Android is pretty much the same and whatever differences exist are easy to navigate Old data settings etc migrated via Samsung and Google accounts even though the old phone data was impossible to retrieve Was able to hook up my old memory card and was up and running with ATT with minimal headaches Graphics look a little nicer Phone is faster more efficient Charges quicker Camera is much better with easier to maneuver and more intuitive settings Sound quality for phone calls is better Seems to hold its charge better and is more efficient All in all an excellent phone so far It is a nice Android phone One of the best galaxy lines Glad they brought the memory card Very handy if you use Samsung pay so if you forget your card then you have your phone in hand Overall a great phone just wish they had more color options as well as case choices This phone has been excellent would recommend over the iphone I love all Samsung products and will be purchasing more in the very near future Really pleased with my phone easy to use stylish fast only thing I wished was different is the sound The speakers are built in and they arent loud for me to enjoy my videos love the camera Used the phone until the replacement note 7s came out Excellent phone Ive been a Galaxy user since the S4 I skipped on the S5 due to a two year contract and eventually got through S6 Loved the S6 but the battery life lack of upgradeable memory and overheating were all issues for me

I took the leap and made the switch to the S7 its water resistance being a huge draw for me as Id been caught in the rain with my S6 a number of times that scared me

I love the design the small changes and the software features of this phone I dont regret my decision one bit I miss the loss of the ir remote and had problems with my first phone overheatingwanting to buy another one for my wife but worried about overheating problems I had to exchange my note 7 for the recall and I was very upsetbut I was taken care of and was given the edge 7 as a loaner its a great phone but it is to small and I love the show pen feature on the note y I contemplated getting the iphone7 but just could not do it I have had samsung products for the last 10 years and have always loved themI am very loyal to samsung and will remain one Every product has issues and I will stand by them I amenjoying this trouble freeI would recommend it to anyone Awesome And very convenient I recommend this
I am Samsung patronage I love this phone and its features definitely the fastest phone I have ever had My only complaint is that it is supposed to be drop resistant but the first time I dropped it at about two and a half feet the glass on the back spiderwebed and the front got a Crack by the speaker I love it great phone display is wonderful camera awesome All in all one one the best out there Neat and fast sim tray a little flimsy but works fine All around really nice and trusty just like all the other Galaxys I have owned Good feature and a great design over all I have recommended this phone to some iPhone users if they ever decides to switch to another phone I love the galaxy I started out with the 3 then 4 then 5 and now 7 It is the best phone ever great camera great pictures I all so have tablets I will always use Samsung Ive been very pleased with my Galaxy s7 and my only issue has been the battery life However as that is a complaint across nearly every phone its hardly something that would keep me from buying it again Plus the phone features two powersaver options to help extend battery life On the first level of power saving my phone typically will last a 15 days and Im a pretty heavy user Ive been incredibly pleased in terms of camera overall speed and connectivity There have been several aha moments over the past months where I learned a new cool feature Would definitely recommend to a friend or stranger I really like my new Samsung S7 Edge I came from a Note 3 and the battery life is so much better on the edge The charge rate it is also 1 reason why I love it The Quick Charge ability is amazing compared to the Note 3 This was my loaner while waiting on my replacement Note7 It is a very close 2nd to the Note7 Seriously considered keeping it but the Spen and newer version of Touchwiz won me over Over all the phone is nice beautiful design and a gorgeous screen Samsung skimps where it doesnt need to though A glass finger print button would preserve the look far better Better PCI like storage options would help write speeds The performance was bogged down by the interface and often battery suffered Im more of a iOS guy and since went back to a iphone I absolutely hate this phone I also have a s6 also I had a note 7 before the recall this is my replacement phone until the note 7 is sent back out and I hate this phone because of the interface is the exact same as a s6 except the edge function I want my note 7 back it is a way better and faster and smoother operating system then the s7 edge and I hate this stupid micro usb port it is junk please send the note 7 back quick as possible I had the note 7  When it was recalled I was given the option to get this s7 edge  Its not the note 7 but it is a good phone So far I really like the phone better than my LG g5 I absolutely love this phone and would recommend it to everyone I love all the features Camera is great Theres only one thing so far and that is the fingerprint scanner doesnt always work and I have to use my password to sign in This isnt a huge problem though because my husband has an iPhone 6 Plus and it is the same way I love using Samsung pay I feel like it is so much more secure than using my card Overall I wouldnt trade this phone for any other phone I love these galaxy devices Systems are fast screen is not only beautiful but bright and very responsive Camera is also very good

Only a couple things I would like to see First fix this charging issue in which it tells you the port has detected moisture just because its not a brand new Samsung charger Second I wish you would integrate some optical zoom into the camera I needed a new phone after drowning my old one I havent tried out the water proof feature on the new phone yet
 The picture quality seems to be better This is my first Galaxy phone and I absolutely love all the features that it has Ive been an iPhone users and I regret not switching sooner Very few issues good solid phone Have definitely recommended to iPhone users I love the phone My only complaint is that the battery doesnt last as long as you might expect nowhere near 27 hours of talk time I purchased this phone because I love Samsung products It is performing l thought it would Great features love the size not too big Really love the camera This is my 4th Galaxy phone Starting with the original Galaxy S and moving to S3 and S5 and now the S7 I have to say the product line just keeps getting better and better

Super fast amazing screen great quality This phone is so smooth no lag and everything is super responsive The new fingerprint sensor is great So much better than what was on the S5 no more swipes YEAH

My only complaint is the bloatware that Verizon forces on the phone Not Samsungs fault but it is annoying to have all that crud on the phone that will never get used Its sleek fast and I love the wrapped screen display It looks almost 3d Tried it out with a vr headset and it looks amazing It ran all the programs without overheating and the quality was phenomenal Definitely need a case for daily use because the wrapped screen makes it hard to use easily with one hand Has the phone for only 1 day coming from a G5 Its quite FAST I do find it to a bit touchy in regard to unintentionally selecting apps or pressing the button on the site of the phone Maybe I will get used to that time will tell I also find that the surface although elegant is so prone to showing every single finger print I will be placing it in a Otterbox case so that will not be an issue moving forward 

I also notice that there is no longer a IR Blaster as I had on my S5 I was surprised and a bit disappointed but can live with it 

Another thing that does have me concerned is the phone gets VERY hot very quickly Even just sitting there on the charger its HOT to the touch when placed in the hand I am wondering how this will affect the performance in particular when put into a protective case 

Time will tell  I can say overall I am very excited about the new S7 and hope that some of my expressed concerns will be mitigated as I have more time to use the phone My G5 was acting up since last system update and struggling to perform with some of my apps I upgraded to G7 ease of transferring my pics apps and other items to new phone Didnt lose anything I just needed to setup fonts wallpapers and what icons I wanted visible disable the things I never use 
Pokémon Go performs much better now 

Im still exploring the new features I like the idea of Themes for the phone being able to add fonts customizing the look of the phone to make it truly mine The music sounds better on this phone I also like being able to use my files for ring tones or use those from Zedge for individual contacts The expandability of storage is a BIG plus I usually transfer items to the cloud for storage and backup the extra storage allows me to have a mini computer in my hand to do the things I need to do 

 As for battery seems to be holding up so far to heavy use Pokémon Go eats through power when constantly on besides other apps running at same time I have a battery portable charger that is capable of charging it 3xs from near dead condition My Husband plans on upgrading his G5 too impressed with my phone 

Screen resolution is beautiful camera and video are easy to use The additional download from Samsung for camera makes nice photos Can even mirror phone to our Samsung TV pretty awesome toys

So far no dropped calls live in a rural area and signal is stronger than what G5 was able to do

Only thing I dont like are the games that were on the phone I dont play those types of games and they were quickly disabled and if possible uninstalled completely cant figure out things 
face changes with the slightest touch
nothing is easily figured out This is a very expensive phone that breaks easily It is much too fragile even with a good case Upgraded from S5 cannot get a decent WiFi unless I am next to router No infrared for using as a remote Battery is dead in 8 hours or so Cannot save to SD cardyou have to manually move each file Although the phone is cool the edge screen is unnecessary Their are not enough features for it and it is hard to find a good screen protector that will not peel up on the edges when you put a case on it If I could have picked it out I would have got the regular s7 Also the charger and the phone have to lined up oh so right on it for the phone to charge Their hasmore then a few times I woke up to a dead phone cuz it wasnt just right Not many phones are water resistant This is a plus if you have kids or just plain clumsy with liquids around electronics I had Note7 while many claim the only difference is the pen its not an accurate description The Galaxy 7 Edge is slower and not as adaptable Really nice phone Its my favorite one so far A very nice quality phone I am a digital immigrant and was unsure of new technology I have found the amazing features and ease of use on my Galaxy 7 to be amazing A whole new territory to explore for me It has opened innovative possibilities for my work and leisure
Thank you Im an old guy and it works great And very easy to use I had the S1 S3 S5 and now the S7 Each time Samsung has improved the speed capabilities and design of the phone Of course nothings perfect but with each generation I have never had problems with the phone freezing being frustratingly slow or not working properly If you take care of this phone it will take care of you

Pros Fast lots of space looks great menusettings are familiar so you dont have to learn a whole new settings scheme This makes it so easy to pick up and go from the previous generations Although Ive used Atom Launcher on my S3 5 and now 7 the new Themes option makes it so easy to customize the look of your phone I wouldnt be surprised if Atom Launcher cant keep up

Cons Always on featureits a good idea I use it but I havent notice it save the battery at all In fact the battery seems to drain faster on the S7 than the S5 Body designalthough the phone looks so awesome you really need to purchase a phone case The phone body on its own is very slippery As soon as the oils from your hand get on it it gets worrisome to hold I am please I continue with Verizon Phone Options and Plan right outta the box S7 is easy to carry and store My favs the camerapicture clarity and the rear photo capture is perfect for selfies Thanks for giving us the S D Card slot back Samsung Galaxy user for life I chose to switch to the galaxy s7 after owning and iphone 4 and iphone 5 over the past 5 years im loving it so far you can do so much more with this phone and you can tell how smart it really is the autocorrect learns your typing habits making it so much easier to recognize autocorrect another thing i really like is being able to edit files using the microsoft office suite apps you can easily download view and edit files right on the phone i could never do that with an iphone Love the design on the aesthetic side but would prefer if the battery was replaceable The screen looks very nice however the curved edges touches my palm preventing me from using it 1 handed in most cases Ive owned several Samsung products with great resultsthis 7 is no different Just ditched my old S4 and finally upgradedglad I did The new S7 is night and day from my old 4 The UI is clean and responsive and the camera is unreal Its a remarkable phone with its unique features and edge design So far in 3 days I like the phone Just have to remember to close all apps so it doesnt use my battery Hi I have a samsung galaxy s7 and I love it If people bought it I would think they would love it too I loved my Samsung 3 I loved my Samsung 5  I want to love my Samsung 7 but  at least not yet  The battery life is unsatisfactory  The tech rep I spoke with today encouraged me to trade it in  Im in the 14day window  I have an appointment tomorrow to do just that hopefully then I will be able to give it the same 5 stars Ive given previous Samsungs Miss the voice commands that my S4 had Also cant set the alarm to stop after two minutes like my old S4 Had to settle for the Edge7s 32 GB after purchasing the Note 7 and it having 64 GB Yes I can purchase additional memory card but I liked the idea of the phone already have 64GB Still working through the rest of the options and will let you know more later Ease of use transfer from one phone to the other  a breeze and the batterylife is awesome Ive had Galaxy 3 4 5 6 Edge and now 7 non Edge  Best version yet  Terrific battery life Super screen Camera is superb and the fingerprint sensor is very fast Very happy with my phone Second phone First one and I think after the first patch it would not recognize my swipe patternot Had to swap phone out Will not download patch until I know it is a secure patch This is my first smart phone and I was little scared I would have trouble learning how to use it But it has been so easy thanks Sansung Being in the military our son likes the difference in features but liked the idea of an easy transfer too  The video calling will be nice too Ive had this phone for a week  Im still getting used to it but so far I love it  Its way faster than my previous phone and very easy to use I was torn between this phone and the edge I am so happy that I bought this phone It is very easy to navigate but it is still fun I really like the theme features The gold on mine is very beautiful I really like Samsung phones And while I had to deal with the problemfilled Galaxy Note 7 not Verizons fault Im happy to go forward with my S7 phone is good battery life is pretty poor The clarity of the screen s phenomenal My vision isnt the best but I do not have eye strain with this unit The ability to switch from apps works for me quite well IM trying to talk my husband into getting a Samsung he have an iPhone i think he will get  I recently upgraded from the Galaxy S4 to the S7 and the transition has been seamless and the new phone has been awesome Battery life is great it processes quickly and all of my infoapps are available to me like I never switched phones Its great only had a week but glad I got it great phone Changed up from a Blackberry Z10 and the transition has been easy and effortless Pretty instinctive and the clarity of screen is excelent Phone looks awesome got this for my son Birthday I was really hoping the wifi calling feature worked I have owned a S5 for years and just upgraded to the S7 I hardly get a Verizon signal at my home so calls drop all the time The wifi calling feature was disabled on my S5 by Verizon The S7 has it and it rarely connects to wifi for calls I still have dropped calls I think the S5 had better reception 
This phone has a lot of great features but if it doesnt perform making calls its really not worth it The phone is amazing Looks and performs like a dream Need to fix the price Youd think after we keep getting told technology is improving that a 7th edition to the s series would be the ultimate Instead the keypad once again is too small  smaller than my s5 and the touch screen  on both sidesedges still needs improvement unless you have tiny fingers Very Happy with my Samsung 7 Really like the Samsung phone I had my S5 for two years with no issues and have had my S7 for a little more than a week and love it even more They did a great job with the improvements and did not disappoint This is a very snappy phone Very fast Very nice design Much better design than any other phone out there  Specs are insane for a phone I am a very sabyy user and I know what I am talking about Best camera The only thing that could be improved is better louder speakers in my personal opinion but for speed and productivity you dont need loud speakers So for anyone who needs a fast phone Fast nice camera And ton of features this is it The camera focus extremely fast compared to any other phone I cant just explain how nice it is Once again the best phone of early 2016 Maybe the note 7 could be improved but for now this is it A bit pricey but hey You get what u pay for Want the best  Pay a good price warranty and support is amazing too I have not had phone very long Just a few days So far I like every thing about it This is a great phone has a great functions to make a easier life Its easy to use the only thing negative is when it changes words Very happy  took me a long time to upgrade and glad I did  phone is great After I returned my Note 7 due to obvious reasons I hit a spot of Maybe I should cave in Maybe I should get an iPhone Well someone knocked sense into me for I found this phone and fell in love with it It doesnt replace my Note 7 but it is definitely all I could ask for that isnt my Note It is strong thin and has a strong processing system It works very efficiently and is a great addition to my GearFit 2 Watch I love this phone Phone battery does not last very long The phone gets very hot really fast My First impression of the Samsung S7 Edge is that it is very pretty but also seem like it might be very fragile Ive also had a few issues moving my information from one Samsung phone to the new one Right now Im not sure if Id recommend it to a friend or not I will give it a try and see what I thin to write another review that is more informative As with most cell phones I think they might be overpriced however the ability to pay it out with ATT is a very good feature to allow me to purchase a phone of this price range I have used several Samsung products and found them to be of great value so I will give the Edge a try before I form a final opinion I have had wifi issues the entire time Ive had this phone The touch is overly sensitive and the auto brightness is horrible My personal experience with this product has been terrible Im on my 3rd replacement phone Beautiful sleek and easy to use smartphone for any one used to other Android devices The camera has no equal in todays market front facing as well This phone has a great ease of use The slim sleek look is perfect for my taste Only had this phone for a week Im disappointed with the stated 20 hour battery life  I have to turn way down the brightness of the screen  I have the settings set where I have to do everything manually to save the battery  I just don
think I should have to be that particular especially with a new phone All around good ohone One issue is battery doesnt seem to last as long as expected it too but not a deal breaker Love this phone will always be a loyal customer to you I needed a reliable phone Im so glad I bought the Galaxy S7 As a mom of threeI dont get nice things When the kids were making fun of my old Galaxy Ring I decided it was time to upgrade That phone lasted 4 years and is now being used by an 11 year old This phone is awesome It has ample memory space great graphicsand a fantastic camera which is most important for us moms I hope this phone is as durable as Samsungs other products Plusits always good to have a phone that wont break when accidentally dropped in a tub or a toilet Like previous  Samsung and when a fall broke it I upgraded  Again very much like new one I bought the galaxy S7 last weekend and I dont have any complaints I find it easy to use but I upgraded from the S4 so I missed a few in the middle Samsung product is easy to use and it is very apportable I love the phone but when I got this is really wanted the note 7 that why only 4 stars Most responsive phone Ive had The quality of the pictures are amazing My least favorite is the rounded edges of the screen Screen protector filmglass doesnt cover to the edges and it makes it hard to select or type on the screen edges Most of the features and apps work the same as on my former S5 The one other features that I have found frustrating is plugging into a pc to move files back and forth is much more complicated and I have not been able to get the bluetooth to work successfully in my car whereas the s5 connected immediately Its small and freezes frequently  Not impressed This phone renewed my confidence with Verizon  My previous phone was a Galaxy Core Prime and I almost switched carriers because of that phone  The S7 phone is a much better phone  It has a better battery and a LOT more storage capacity  My previous phone made me sound like a robot  would miss calls and delay texts and sounded like an old cordless home phone switching channels when I would talk to someone  I learned my lesson about buying a budget phone  Galaxy S series phones seem to be the most reliable phones Samsung makes I upgraded from the S6Edge which I was also very happy with and while I havent seen a whole lot of brand new features everything is just better and faster I used to have a IPhone but ever since I made the change to Samsung I will never go back to iPhone again Ive had my S7 for about a week now and Ive already discovered how powerful it is Plenty of memory for using several apps at the same time easy to use interface crystal clear calls and a really good speakerphone with no echos or static The camera is excellent The headphones that come with the phone are designed well and are very comfortable to wear while running

It comes halfway charged so you can start using it right away Several apps that I had on my previous phone come already loaded including Google maps for directions while driving Gmail Youtube Messages Google Drive and S Health an excellent fitness tracker which definitely replaces my current exercise tracker Even the builtin heart rate monitor is surprisingly accurate and easy to use 

My friends keep begging me to dunk the thing in watera feature I have yet to try 

The only two drawbacks was 1 a tendency to get really hot the first time you plug it in using fast charging but apparently this is normal and goes away after the first charge You also have the option to turn off fast charging if you dont want the internal cooling system to kick in 2 this phone is sleek and slippery but Im using a protective case with a holster so it doesnt really matter 

Overall this is a fantastic phone and I highly recommend it An outstanding device the S7 has every feature needed for an excellent experience Has performed as advertised and I have had no issues Highly durable but a bit large for me Would prefer a smaller design but want the flag ship Still it seems Samsung has done a good job of maximizing the space to keep it as compact as possible Have dropped it a few times and once from about 4 feet onto tile when out of its caseno dents or dingsIm certain there is some luck to that since it didnt hit on the magic spot but seems quite durable I Like it and have had no problems yet Very happy with new Gs 7 I had the Galaxy S6 and upgraded to the S7 which seems to run faster The colors also seem more vibrant when I set them side by side Ive only had it one day but everything seems to be great about this phone If you liked your S6 you will like this one too The selfie camera on my black S7 is very blurry and there is no way to fix it Beautifyer is off Its very frustrating I will have to trade this phone in for a new one thanks to this Have grown to really enjoy this phone It seems to be learning me and working with me Phone works well except for battery Even with WiFi location  Bluetooth turned off charge is gone in less than 1 day I just upgraded from my s6 to the s7 and I am loving it Only downsides that I can see so far is that with the slight bevel on the sides of the screen the glass doesnt covered it completely Other than that it has a great feel and is wonderful Im glad that they brought back the water resistant feature Good to know it isnt in danger of water I love the Galaxy phones For some stupid reason I got an iPhone 6s and I was SO disappointed
After 5 months of hating that phone I bought a Galaxy s7 and I LOVE it
Thank you Samsung Love my Galaxy s7 Perfect size camera and service Love everything about it I went from the Note 5 to the Galaxy S7 Edge and I have to say that Im glad I made the switch While there is so much that I like about the S7 Ive been disappointed in two things 1 the battery often barely lasts through the day and I dont use it that much and 2 it seems to be more susceptible to unintential pocket dialing than my S5 was
Still am enjoying the upgrade just have to be careful about what apps I have and watch the battery use This is by far the best phone Ive ever owned Nothing bets a Samsung product Love it I am impressed by the battery life and HD quality screen and photos The speed is faster also All over very happy I have only had my phone for a day but I love the way it feels in my hand It runs faster than my old phone This galaxy 7 runs my apps pretty fast and has a mode that doesnt run my battery out I just wish this phone was out way earlier Definely would recommend this phone to any one that want a good fast phone I just received today and so far I love it Ill update if anything changes IMO I just got my galaxy s7 not the edge about 2 weeks or less ago and absolutely love it I have owned the Galaxy The Galaxy S the S2 the S3 The S4 the S5 and the S5 active and this one by far takes the cake Love it to death and couldnt have been happier with it if I had made it myself Ive only had this phone for about a day and already love it First 24 hours  great phone Battery life pretty good and have a extra save mode or ultra Lots of new features I like the text message featuresI like HD video screen I bought it one month ago and so far its been great I love my galaxy 7 edge plus but for the value of the phone I expect the glass to be a little thicker any little knick or light drop even on carpet and the screen cracks or shatter NOT GOOD I love the performance and all the features would recommend it just make sure to get shatter proof screen protector as soon as you buy the phone and case Nice and sleek just not as durable I love the design of the phone and the ease of use It has awesome features Ive alwayd been a galaxy fan Ive had the s7 for two weeks and Im obsessed All the newest technology including fingerprint unlocking Easy to navigate Its truly the best phone ive had This is my 3rd galaxy Each one is better then the last This phone is fast fast fast thank God now it has increased memory capacity and its water proof The registration process too three days and a visit to a Verizonstorebut it seems to be marching along with only a few huck ups This is the first Android  Samsung product Ive owned I was scared to switch from the iPhone as that was all Id knownbut Im so happy I made the switch This phone is fabulous I love the big bright screen Its so much easier to read than my last phone 

Its easy to use too It works more like a PC than a Mac which I love 

Ive already recommended the phone to several friends The galaxy s7 has so many amazing features and ways to personalize The vivid display just makes everything pop and the quality of the phones features makes me feel like I could do anything I wanted for entertainment Awesome The Galaxy S7 Edge is just the perfect sized smartphone with tons of interactivity to keep it exciting I love the Theme feature where the entire wallpapers and icons are transformed into a specific theme chosen from the theme store The screen is at a superb and mind blowing HD resolution I just LOVE staring atwellanything on the screen Great job Samsung You have a customer for life I highly recommend the S7 Edge Looks great in Black Onyx too does what I expected except I still cannot sync my google addresses I thought my old phone was on The Cutting Edge of Technology Just goes to show how quickly things change in the electronics world I just got this 2 weeks ago and am still learning how to use it  Having trouble posting a video to facebook  It shows being on there but wont download One month and so far it is a great phone Bought this 8days ago love everything about it especially the camera Only thing I dont like is the battery life Other than that great phone Great features and very easy to use I have recommended to a current iPhone user who is now making the switch thank you but I should have bought a bigger cell but they were too expensive Its a nice and slick phone Easy to work with and use This is the absolute best Android Phone you will ever use especially if both Software and Hardware matter to you

If you are pure Android OS fan then this phone may not be a good choice for you However this is as close a competition Android will ever give to Apple overall the phone runs very smooth with some very good functionality and superior hardware design

For me the achilles heel for this particular phone is its battery life or lack thereof and it may be a deal breaker for many who are looking to buy a phone which will last them at least 8 hours with normal usage If that is you then this phone is not for you and its a shame that such a fantastic phone in every other respect fails on such a critical metric

If you are coming over from IOS and like the ease of use and routine updates I would advise you to stay put Android ECO system 8 years later is still a mess marred with irregular updates and lack of support

Again if you are OK with subpar battery life and do not care for ISO Eco system you cannot go wrong with the best phone Android has to offer Upgraded from a S4 to an S7 and Im in Heaven  Pictures are so great  I am in love with my 7 Edge it is everything I expected and more Just traded in my S5 for the S7 by far the best Galaxy to date Great design lightweight and durable Takes very good pictures also the edge app is very convenient as well Upgraded from the S5 Some of the features that I Couldnt wait to get are Samsung pay fingerprint features fast battery charging and better battery life I havent used the camera yetbut my S5 was great and I expect this one will be too I have been a Samsung user for over 6 years and wouldnt buy another brand I can only hope S Voice is improved Id many frustrations with it on the S5 Just got the phone yesterday so far loving the speed and screen brightness Battery is still a question mark and learning curve a little steeperror than expected Lightening fast great display quality super think phone Pretty freakin nice Only had a few days but impressed Still more to explore Many of my colleagues are iPhonies that gobble up any Apple device on the market but research shows that many of the features being toted such as the advanced camera were introduced on the Galaxy 7 Why pay more for a device that is simply catching up and forces you to use a closed system architecture

Plus the integration of Gear VR with phone expands the capabilities and upcoming possibilities beyond what crApple has to offer Fragile but awesome great speed and performance love it Great phone but prefer the note Love the edge feature I love Samsung products I have smart TVs 2nd smart phone tablets and loving the clarity and speeds Outstanding Product everything works smooth and I have enjoyed everything so far this phone is ok battery life could be better and replaceable My only complaint is minor but I wish the back button was on the left instead of the right Beyond that I love this phone

You cant beat the bundles of phones tablets watches and either SD cards or Gear VR They give you so much more than other manufacturers

Smooth operation customizable awesome screen and battery life Finding the edge screen more and more useful every day Again I love this phone I was very excited to get this phone When it came I ran to the door and opened the box and set everything up immediately Things like it being waterproof and having the beautiful Edge made me so excited for to arrive I was very protective of it However my mother would not order the case or the screen protector yet despite my consistent request About the third day of having a phone I noticed there were slight scratches on the display glass Are you can probably tell after being so excited for this phone and then damaging it on the third day of owning it and some unknown way I was very unhappy but I got over it a day later because it was only a small scratch you couldnt really see it at all However about a week later Im using my phone to look up words for my International history class and I noticed a fairly deep scratch in my phone screen Understand I dont have a screen protector and thats on me but it was never dropped it was never rubbed against anything it was never put in any position to where it would get scratched so deeply its like it happened out of nowhere It took me quite a while to get over that one oas the Sleek look of the phone was a little harmed But there was another thing about the phone that threw me off that would be that the phone gets extremely hot when charging and when running a lot of programs at high display settings obviously I understand that a phone gets hot when theres programs running and its a lot of work for the phone I get that and I get that the phone is glass The phone just gets so hot you you kind of need to put it down its almost ridiculous and then hearing the rumors of people saying their Galaxy S7 Edge is exploding is very offputting for me as my phone gets extremely hot when charging So Id say its a great phone for the edge features You just need to take very good care of it It is smaller than what I expected It feels cheap and it is slow I have not found a good use for the Edge whatsoever also its annoying that nothing protects the phone The phone itself is fragile the screen cracks from a little drop 1 feet high 
I wouldnt recommend the Edge Buy the S7 instead and put on a good protector 
Samsung should offer to repair within 1 year free of charge the Edge phones Everyone I know at my workplace who got the Edge all of them got their screen and the back of the phone shattered and cracked Userfriendly takes great photos openplatform makes this so awesome Its a pricy phone but it looks great and is very water resistant and proof Looks so cool and love the cameras and audio volume The casing is tough but the glass is too fragile and cracks too easy as the first time it was a spider effect and the phone worked for five hours then it went all crazy and un useable You cant get it fixed I know as I tried to get it repaired where I bought it They the one with at in the name said to replace it and I have the insurance but its like 14 of the price of a new one for the deductible 
So I replaced it and The replacement this time I bought a good case to help protect it Well wouldnt you know it the case helps drops but does nothing for the glass  Well it was laid down with case on glass side down and one of our cats jumped up on the bathroom counter right on it and his weight cracked the glassagain this time the phone worked for two days and died its toast againso as much as I loved it its a piece of  Well you get the idea Very good phone for the money Love how fast it is Microphone issues a problem Absolutely love everything about this phone Slim fast amazing display awesome camera and of course the curveday screen which is amazing Battery life is better than ever I spilled water on my phone yesterday in fact it was partially submerged But nothing happened

Loving the phone every single moment I use my phone all day for the date and time This absolutely love this feature Everything I remember from my S4 is there only better I just bought this phone it does what I want takes amazing pictures and the display is the best The only negative thing I have to say is that it seems my battery dies faster then ever Maybe its just what Im doingbut I still love the phone Every icon has a new service with added fee rather than just working as old phoneie voicemail icon  dont want visual voicemail  no way to bypass
Free 250k memory card  cant get the purchase date to populate  no phone number to call anyone  email address doesnt work Love the service clarity speed and price Good phone Light weight Easy to use Easily heard Terrible I am so disappointed that Verizon would sell this  Terrible The screen is suppose to be strong but it cracks so easily  I have gone through 2 phones Exchanged for a Note 7 and its been a great phone I left my I phone for the note 7 only to have it recalled I have called to speak with someone regarding my disappointment but the folks on the other end could not help With the release of the new I phone I was hoping Samsung would want me to keep their phone The phone is OK I love the feel of this phone in my hand The cameras are amazing Its super easy to use and very customizable Only downsides are battery life and internal processing can be slow if you run too many apps I love this product have a lot of great features For the price it was more than i thought it would be but i am happy with it Bought it easy transfer I love this phone I cant live without it My wife and I upgraded to these phones after having used Galaxy S4s for years The S7 is dramatically faster it has plenty of internal space for games and music The screen while a little on the smaller side looks amazing After my iphone6 died I decided to try out an android again after my HTC One that I had a few years ago I wasnt confident that I would like the change but I am extremely satisfied with the build quality and resolution of the s7 edge It looks far better than my old iphone6 and I was always more of a PC person so its great to have some cohesion between my devices again
Recommended highly No problemsorry as of yet Overall this is a good phone I like the look of the curved screen but in actual use it becomes a hindrance It feels like it is going to slip out of your hand everytime I use it It would be beneficial to have some texture to the actual sides of the phone It would make it feel more secure Love the new phone and service is great This phone really is awesome and it is very strong just doesnt break I love the features and style of my S7 phone It is so easy to use and transferring my files a photos to this phone was a breeze Love It Product works well but very fragile compared to other phones Ive owned I also dont like how some of the apps miss features that were available on iPhone Settings are harder to find and control like app sounds etc I replaced my Note 7 with the S7 Edge and I am super happy I didnt really need the note feature so I decided not to wait for the replacement Note 7 and downgraded to the S7 Edge Not a downgrade at all I think its just as nice a little less expensive the right size and lets face it super cute since I picked the Gold one 
The BIGGEST plus is that it still uses the same micro USB charging port whereas the Note 7 had a whole new and different port style That was pretty disappointing so Im glad thats no longer an issue VERY HAPPY with my NEW new phone Easy to use fast processor Originally upgraded to the note7 was waiting on the replacement from the recall Ended up getting the S7 because the edge of the note was not protected with the Otterbox case I am not careful enough to note crack the exposed edge I love the galaxy I wish the S7 was as large as the note and the edge without the edge screen So it is a little small but other than that its perfect The battery does not hold all day long  With just a few texts or short telephone calls my battery needs recharging within 8 hours   My emails dont refresh as quick as it did on my Samsung S4  When I clear my emails from my PC they should also clear on the phone but can lag 24 hours before that is done  I dont like that the dual screens to access your phone  One screen for sleeping then another screen to swipe then a 3rd screen to enter my password  way too complicated for security  Put the password screen on top  I do like Samsung phones for the camera and great clear crisp images  This one is comfortable in the hand  The price of these phones is ridiculous and NOT justified  My 4 year old S4 phone died so had to purchase a new one but if had to do over would really consider the older simpler phones that just text and talk This phone is fast light and easy to use If the battery life was set out of the box this phone would be a 5 Star You need to set some out of the box apps to disabled or cut off the function so that they dont drain the battery I have has the S3 S4 S5 S6 and now the S7 This is another great phone from Samsung I especially like some of the new features that allow for better integration with my car This new features allow for a bettersafer access while driving which I do a lot for work I recently upgraded to this phone I couldnt be happier The ease of use and the the quickness that it has is awesome I would recommend this phone to anyone and I have I like the new Samsung 7 Android phone It has a lot of features I did buy the lifeproof cover like I did when I got my Samsung 5 but it does not fit real well on the edges sometimes making typing difficult I did not buy the curved model phone either Also the voice to text is not as good as it used to be Many errors and I do not mumble Other that these 2 issues I do really like the phone This is the first phone I ever really love Love the storage and camera features Batter life is great and I have showed off my phone to people around me This phone really needs a detailed online manual for every feature Having to look online for most instructions is frustrating Not only does this have all the android features I love but it also has a sleek design I didnt like the new version that has the rolled screen edges so this phone was the perfect option for me It combines all of the features of the galaxy 7 but without the fragile screen Nice easy to use Many new features New operating system is compatable with newer apps Only con so far is the smaller keyboard Otherwise it serms to be a great value Im pleased with the phone but the operating system is terrible This phone is just the right size to fit in my pocket great design and stylish look and feel This screen is bright sharp and smooth scrolling 
Quick finger print security Love the always On feature and of course the Edge And an excellent camera and video with SD expansion I switched from apple products to android What else can I say other than I love it I love galaxy and I love this phone A littler hard to use one handed but Im sure Ill adjust Otherwise it does everything and more This is my third Galaxy phone So far this has been my favorite I love the size of the battery and the water and dust resistance The dual edge screen is great I love how you can customize the panels of apps and tasks that you use most often as well as other information you would like to see  The phone is fast due to the 4 GB of RAM and the ability to expand your memory to 256 MB to handle an enormous amount of downloads is great I highly recommend this phone Ive only had this phone for about 10 days but I already love it I read about some of the new features before buying it so it made the transition easier The Verizon employees who helped me were knowledgeable and got me on my way  pretty fast Theyve even called to see if everything is going well with the phone and to see if I have any questions The customer service was great I started with Note 7 and after recall picked the S7 they are exactly the same just smaller screen and no penwhich I hadnt used anyway Fits in pocket easily and lightweight The price difference made it an easy choice I love this phone The variety camera  ease of use makes it sweeeet I bought the new phone and am impressed It is easy to use and the battery holds a charge much longer My previous phone was the Galaxy 5S I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge in June 2016 It was a great phone from the start The ONLY bad thing about it is after the latest software update it seems the battery doesnt last as long as it once did thats my only issue Other than that the style features and performance is excellent Definitely a better device than any iPhone on the market right now I love samsung S7 edgei look great S7 edge So far I love everything about the phone The way it feels to hold the battery life is good considering all it doesthere are lots of useful and fun apps and features Love the side tabs I have had my new phone for about a week now  I was using the Samsung Galaxy S4 and in my opinion was one of the worst phones I have had  I was on my third Samsung Galaxy S4 and totally disgusted  So far updating to the new Samsung Galaxy S7 has been excellent  Time will tell This phone is bright and easy to read The colors pop and the unit is lightweight It is intuitive to use so not a lot of time is needed to get caught up on how to use the phoneapps The camera is easy to access and the pics are good This phone is great but not as amazing as my note 7 I want my note 7 back As soon as they are available again Ill switch back I will remain loyal to Samsung products Performance features gear overall feelall great Another solid device from Samsung This phone takes great pictutes The name Samsung itself is synonymous with high quality and this phone is no exception The edge may be a little overkill but still a quality product The processor speed on this phone beats the pants off my old HTC M9 very Nice screen and brilliance Very easy to figure out Battery life as expected could be better Excellent speed and plenty of apps Love this phone and all its featuresall Samsung phones are easier to operate than competition this was the main reason I switched a few years ago they never disappoint The only people I know who dont use Samsung never tried one so they dont even know what they are missingSamsung is the Best hands downno one even comes close The news about a possible recall was hopping as I was searching around to buy a note 7 I ended up researching get the s7 edge in more detail and was extremely happy with how the phone fit what I wanted Giving the chance I still would stay with the s7 edge over any other phone I love the cordless charging and the color but the cordless charging made my decision  It does take some getting used to as the back lower right is different use etc  My salesperson Ms Isham out of Midland MI is super and the ONLY person I will ruse and recommend from now on Love the Galaxy S7 nothing Id like to change about it Just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 a week ago Really like it When I turn on the phone and I have emails waiting my S5 would give me the option to delete the unwanted emails very easily by clicking the boxes in front of the email titles and push Delete just once to delete all unwanted emails I miss that feature The size and face of the phone are perfect Although my contacts were transferred to the new S7 some information on each contact was missing forcing me to go through each contact to complete the info That has been very time consuming Other than that I am very pleased with my new S7 So far this device has been very good to use I bought this phone as a replacement for a Galaxy S4  Was hoping for better reception in my work place which I got and it is easier to use than the S4 So far so good just upgraded from S5 only issue Im having is customizing notifications sounds Bit frustrating but Ill figure it out I love the camera and the size is ok
This is just a temporary phone until I get my note 7 back Had iPhone previously but was looking a change Samsung Galaxy you can add storage music apps  great camera Big screen Takes good video  fast camera less blurry pics Overall thoroughly enjoy it I think Samsung was smart to change the phone to allow you to add additional memory The camera on the phone takes good pictures Overall I would recommend this phone The Galaxy 7 is fun to use and has all the featuresI need and a few more The s7 edge is quick nice to look at easy to hold and holds a charge I would recommend to anyone that this a good phone Great phone but just a temporary until I can get the Note 7 back Great piece of technology definitely a step up from my previous galaxy phone I previously owned a Galaxy S5 which was still a great phone My only complaint for that was the charging port wasnt a fan of the charging cover or charging cord Moving forward I currently switched to Verizon and unfortunately my S5 model wasnt compatible So obviously I went with the most recently released Galaxy I have to say my wife and I love our S7 edges It has amazing picturevideo quality and has effortless performance with its all of its features Ive yet to find anything that I dont like about it Thanks again Samsung for another great device youll always be my first choice when it comes to buying electronics My new Galaxy is working great I havent had a minutes trouble I would recommend and purchase Samsung products again Love the phone has all the features that I currently are using and more Would recommend to others Excellent screen nice setup Fun to use Another good phone Ive owned a Galaxy 3 a Galaxy Note 4 Edge a Galaxy Note 7 and currently a Galaxy S7 The S7 is the best Galaxy yet for my needs I enjoyed the Note Edge 4 screen size a lot But the added cost vs the S7 coupled with the fact that I rarely used the S Pen makes the S7 the best value for my needs

The S7 is a fantastic smart phone I love the look and size Everyone was making bigger which I am not fond of Love the gold color I just love the look and how I can customize the theme of my entire phone Really easy to use and everything just looks so good The Galaxy 7 exceeds what I was expecting It is rugged surviving several drops onto concrete floors and flexible enough for all the apps that I need Upgraded to the 7 from the 5 Its easy to use as the features are similar to what Ive been used to Its fast and I find that the battery lasts longer Colors are bright and pictures are awesome I bought this because sales girl said it was easy to use Like last smart phone I asked if it had a flashlight and GPS and fast picture taking It does have a good camera However this phone is way more complicated than what I needed I have yet to find a flashlight The sound is way to low on my alarm and ring Also I cant hardly hear my text Phone is very heavy Battery runs down quickly I had a Samsung galaxy mini before which I loved except the camera isnt as good as this one Not Happy    Should of went with apple I bought this phone in May 2016 and already my screen has lost its brilliance and has a yellow tint Now more than likely Ill get stuck with a certified like new replacement I bought this about a month ago and I really love it Its a great overall mobile device Its fast it has a great camera The features are fantastic Really love the vibrant screen and the water resistance Would recommend this to anyone Upgraded from a S4 to the S7 and so far so good I really like the camera and the battery life I was a Big Microsoft Windows Phone users but got almost all of my windows apps back and my information from apps like word one note were all moved over to this phone after I signed in Only thing I cant get is my movies that I downloaded from Microsoft Movies  TV I still get it on my laptop  Xbox My galaxy S7 is awesome The phone has respectable battery life for its size responds quickly is surprisingly light and has so many thoughtful software and design features The camera is great in low light conditions and takes the best photos Ive seen from a phone camera Too many little details to mention that I enjoy but would definitely recommend I like the wireless charging and the waterproof features but other than that not much different than my S5 Disappointed that the screen is smaller and the sceen protector doesnt een cover the screen to the edges I am having problems with it and will be taking it back to the store to be checked out It ocassionally goes dead in the middle of a phone conversation and it doesnt notify me of text messagesno ring no vibration no flashing indicator light  Dicovered this when people started calling me to see if I had received their text as I hadnt responded to them Pros great screen size comfortable shape awesome camera great battery life

Cons typical Samsung charging temp issue a little warm charging using wireless charging and when device is turned on Other than that occasional screen freezestutter I loved the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and this phone is very similar Havent had it long so Im still getting to know it I have owned plenty of phones and this is by far the best one yet The S7 edge I a great phone after I loaded all the games and apps I still havent had any bog downs Just wish screen protector was easier to install I have had this phone for about a month and I am still discovering features that amazes me The only complaint I have was the struggle of finding a compatible case and screen protector that would mate effortlessly I have always protected my galaxy phones in the past but the edge is a challenge I like the Otter products and purchased the symmetry series back case And my favorite manufacturer of skins has always been Techmatte They do not offer a skin for the s7 edge After multiple attempts with other skins I gave up Just not enough surface area for a good adhesion I did notice that Samsung offers a complete case for the s7 edge How long has that been on the market Other than that its the best phone I have ever owned Until the s8 comes out Love the phone Easy to use and it works great A wonderful phone Its a great phone Ive had several galaxy phones and the S7 Edge is the best Beautiful I just got this till Samsung gets our note 7s back That was the best phone period September 14th 2016
First off I want to say that I got this phone because I am waiting for the revised Note 7 without the battery problem If I had I choice I would never get the Galaxy S series because Im loyal to the Note Series

Pros
 Beautiful and Sleek
 IP68
 The Camera is awesome 
 unbeatable screen even the IPhone 7 got nothing on it
 Snapdragon 820 is a beast
 Always on display Really useful
 Way better implementation of the fingerprint scanner compared to the Note 4

Cons
 the edges are way to annoying compared to the Note 7s more refined edges
 The speaker is not as loud compared to the Note 7
 non removable battery 
 Allowed Verizon to add Bloatware Follow Apples example 
 Not typeC I dont understand why Samsung didnt put typeC on the S Series and added it to the Note 7 I think its pretty unfair to your customers doing that just to make an extra coin Galaxy s7 edge is an absolute masterpiece Similar to the edge 6 plus however phone s7 fits better in your hand and is not as slippery as the s6 edge plus This phone in my mind is perfection A true flagship phone and a Samsung masterpiece I got my phone a week ago  so easy to navigate I upgraded from the S4 and the features are awesome great color and nice camera Another great phone from Samsung Ive had the Note lines from the beginning but switching to S7 this time It did not disappoint Met and surpassed all expectations Thanks Samsung I love my S7 Its light weight Decent sized screen Over all usage Its all a pleasure This was an easy transition from my S5 Same features with some added bonuses I am very pleased Its a beautiful phone The screen pops because of the edge design Samsung goes out of its way to help you and make sure you understand how to use it I love just about everything in this phone The only thing I wish Samsung had was a music interface like iTunes I have had this for 2 days I had the LG G3 and was considering the G5 Decided on this phone instead Not as big as the G3 I am starting to figure it out Have been on line looking for tips and tricks Everyone in company has S7 or S7 Edge They all love them Time will tell for me Great phone I really like the design and how well it fits in your hand very lightweight and qualitiy is amazing I had the galaxy s5 not much different but runs faster Takes amazing pictures Easy to use Great apps Fun games and all around good phone This is my second Galaxy phone My first was a S5 and the S7 is a step up The battery last all day and I dont have to charge it Plus I can fast charge the phone in under an hour The photo quality is excellent I like the fact that I get better cell and 4g with this phone No dropped calls or dead spots I found the battery life to be improved over the S5 The photos are awesome As a long time iPhone user I was hesitant to switch to the android platform I am glad that I did the display on the Galaxy s7 Edge is the best Ive seen on any handset and I checked out many while shopping for a new phone The camera is also exceptional and the operating system is really quick One piece of advice since there arent many choices out there yet for protective cases is be very careful to not drop the phone because by the edge screen design it can shatter easily so be sure and be careful and buy a good case to protect the phone because both the front and rear are made of gorilla glass Ive never had a screen Crack on any phone that Ive owned but managed to shatter the screen on my s7 edge within one month of owning it Thank God I had taken the insurance on the phone I am still happy with the s7 edge Just be careful The Galaxy S7 is a great upgrade from my Galaxy S III The S7 has features that make it very functional and useful Ive only had the phone less than a week so Im still getting acquainted with it So far Ive not found anything I dont like I just came from an iPhone 6 Plus At first I didnt like the fact that the S7 edge felt so small in my normal sized hands But now Im getting used to it Its very fast great camera and I absolutely love the fact that I now have a 64 gig sd card along with 32 gig internal memory My 6plus was only 16 gigs and I was forced twice to delete contents The battery life is not bad but since Ive owned several android its a chore to make sure the background apps are always off or the battery will drain very quickly I finally upgraded from my dumbphone please dont laugh and decided upon the Samsung Galaxy S7 I selected it for all the benefits over the alternatives wireless charging water resistance OLED display large battery etc It was an excellent choice

I have been using this phone for about four months and have only plugged it in once I wanted to test the fast charging capability as my battery was sitting at only 3 after a pretty busy day It allowed the phone to charge by almost 90 in a little more than one hour which is pretty crazy

This phone has allowed me to join just as Pokemon Go was released and the location service is definitely taxing on the battery however the convenience of wireless charging as well as the fast charging capability allows you to keep going throughout the day

The design of the S7 worried me All the glass and the slightly curved front display made my decision more difficult than it really needed to be The glass made me worry about its durability so I was concerned until I was able to find a nice case as well as some kind of screen protector

Lastly the speaker was a bit of a concern as there is only one on the bottom which is easily covered by your thumb or finger The sound isnt the greatest but its good enough and I can overlook it thanks to all the other benefits

Finally a bit of a rant People dont seem to understand the glass on the front display is curved even though this is not the S7 Edge Look closely at your phone Its curved The reason why the curved display is relevant is because I want to find a tempered glass screen protector and many of them either do not reach full edgetoedge coverage or they create a halo effect Product reviews for Samsung Galaxy S7 accessories are surprisingly negative because consumers dont seem to know whats in their hands Its frustrating No fault to Samsung in that regard Hands down the best phone Ive used in years It does everything I need it to and more and is so easy to use I have absolutely no complains about this phone I had the Galaxy S6 and had the chance to upgrade to the S7 Im very glad I did The phone is faster has a better screen and takes great pictures I also noticed a few things in which the 2 phones differ

1 The battery on my S6 used to get hot Thats not the case with the S7 even when using the quick charge 

2 I find the screen rotation so much better on the S7 With the S6 it would take a few shakes to get the screen to rotate Sometimes I even checked to make sure the feature was turned on

3 Battery life is better on the S7

Overall a great phone Havent tried it with the Samsung Gear Phone does have several nice improvements over the Galaxy S6 such as the addition of a micro SD card slot and water proofing the phone  There is a couple negatives to go with it no IR blaster and no Quick Charge 30 Need more time of usage  Had a classic for a long time My old phone stopped charging thus I had to upgrade to a newer phone I couldnt take the knock on feature any longer Hated taking pictures inside my pocket Because it was a Verizon phone I was unable to disable that feature This phone will have to do for 2 years After struggling with a S5 phone that never seemed to work right this phone is heaven  Right now I have only had it for about two weeks but I can say that there is not anything I have tried to do that I dont like or cant figure out  One blipI use the airplane mode often and find that it was easier to access when pulling down the screen on the old Samsung  The s7 you have to scroll once to the left  No biggie but you asked for feedback I had to return my first phone the day after receiving it because callers had a hard time hearing me  They would say that my voice was breaking up when I was seated in the same place  My signal has always been strong so that is not an issue  I also do not like how I cannot change the background color of my contacts list  It is an ugly orange color  I  contact Samsung and they couldnt do it either I have had Samsung phones before and have had issues with them I needed to replace my IPhone and my son convinced me to try it again I have to say I love this new phone Its fast its dependable and the camera is fantastic I have to take picture for products and with this camera I have to do very little editing The pictures are pretty much good to go I was very happy with the s5 however was excited to receive the new s7 The phone does operate smoothly camera is wonderful 2 concerns though 1 I had way better service coverage with the s5 2 The battery does get really hot after charging or hours of use Very disappointed as this makes me question the safety of the s7 Im not a big tech person so this is a simple and easy to use It has a good camera and great battery life I know it has a lot more capacity than what I use but I like that if I need it its there I definitely love my new phone Its taking me a while to figure it all out though I switched over from the iPhone which was very intuitive and Im finding the Galaxy to be not entirely userfriendly Im young and Ive used a lot of different products so I can pretty much figure out how to use technology but Im really having to read through a lot of the help sections and Googling different things to get the hang of the Galaxy I want to recommend it to my parents but I cant imagine how frustrated theyd get trying to get used to the system I love all the features but I wish there was a manual that came with it Nice size screen and customizable Easy for older people Havent had my Galaxy 7 long but I love it Considered going with an iPhone but Im glad I didnt I love this phone

It has everything I need and more easily obtained apps and info Love the new design You can never go wrong samsung Swapped my Note 7 for the 7S Edge and am very happy It is the same phone a bit smaller slightly larger battery but does not have the stylus or retina scanning but it meets my needs Not sure if I will go back to the Note 7 when the updated versions with corrected battery are available they clear crisp and good color The pictures print out good I pride myself on having up to date technology and the phone I had before was just less than adequate I needed to upgrade fast finally my day ventures led me to the Verizon storeafter jumping from electronic to electronic I landed on this amazing device From thalose moments I was stuck sold and refurbished for this product and my opinion of smartphones completely ascended ThankaSamsung I love the phone The battery life is the only problem i have with thr phone The S7 edge is a really good handheld for most functions and has admirable features the most notable of which is the camera  whose pixel definition is best of any device I have seen yet and everyone who sees it says they think the camera is great The battery life of S7edge is far superior to the previous Samsung mobile phone I had the Galaxy 3 and Galaxy 4 Amazing photo and video quality Very pleased If you will use it for that I would highly recommend This is the best Samsung yet I absolutely love it Wife and I both just got the s7 edge and we both love the phone A 32g space A pictures quality A tricks I love it but it will not play music via USB was very disappointed with that This phone is very easy to use functions and designs are user friendly I enjoy the Samsung owned apps like the s health the most It made you feel like personalized Love the power and speed of this phone Im coming from a Samsung J3 so this is quite a step up The display is crisp and clear and the sound is better than I expected

The Fast Charging is an exceptional feature I love samsung products because they are practical and eady to use I have 2 mobile phone  a tablet all communicate together for multiple purpose The Samsung S7 Edge is a great smartphone Fast efficient and great for fast smartphone multicasting 

I have been using Samsung electronics for decades and have always found them to be reliable and a great value for your dollar Not a significant perceptible improvement from previous S6 Does not work with some of my Bluetooth devices Severe buyers remorse I had the Samsung S5 and really liked it but my pictures didnt seem clear The S7 has an amazing camera Battery life seems to last longer and calls are clear The only thing I could complain about is finding a glass screen protector that covers the whole screen But all in all its a good phone Very nice phone but I was a little disappointed because coming from a note 4 I did not like the smaller screen Turned in the note 7 for this phone Doesnt almost everything the note does and is cheaper and fits better in my hand Two weeks with new phone LOVE IT Thank you i have spent in last year 2000 with Samsungphone equipment So far I have nothing to complain about Wish I had had this when I first started working on computers 1960s
But it could use a real manual to aid with the phones operations Had this about 10 days Very disappointed with it compared to my Samsung 4s If I wanted the functionality of an iPhone I would have bought one Not seeing any improvements and thinking about returning it It constantly has pop up apps that it wants me to download When its charging it has done additional lock screen that I need to unlockthats a pain I used to be able to delete emails by a quick swipe Now its a 2 step process And speaking of email mine keep deleting after a day or two And the battery isnt as good a I thought it would be  Seems to only last a day I dont stream and not on using it constantly  I think I should at least get 2 days without a charge but that isnt the case  for the first time not living my Samsung Very easy to use due to its similarities to my old galaxy s6 Havent tested the water restitance yet nor do i plan on Also LOVE the upgradeable storage I had the Samsung S4 and recently got the S7 love the S7 It has great cameras and the pictures are so clear Love the accessories The battery last longer than I thought it would and a lot longer than my S4 All in all a great phone I like the phone Its nice Its a bit heavy My fiance has some issues with his already The battery dies fast for him And his freezers and wont show pictures I send him in texts Over all I think the phone is nice But some kinks in it The store staff took my old Iphone and got me  good price for it took everything off my old phone and set up my new one for me I love the way it works Its a bigger screen than I had and nice Google connectivity Voice Mail was not set up for a few days till I figured that out but I will be happy for a few years now I have owned an iPhone and a Windows Phone and by far I am happiest with the Samsung Android phone The phone itself is great and offers a variety of great features such as a fast processor high pixel density display 4gb of ram etc My only issue is that I bought the phone with a battery case and at most I get through one day of usage I would consider myself to be a slight power user using my phone anywhere between 45 hours consecutively But having owned the galaxy s5 active and getting better battery life out of that phone versus this phone and a battery case Im kind of disappointed It be just my phone so Im going to bring it in Ill repost after I bring it in and let you guys know if I have the same issue Never had a Samsung before and now I think I wont ever have anything else Great battery life 32GB and exceptional camera
Is anyone going to have a tempered glass screen protector for the S7 Edge This by far is the best wireless phone I have ever owned It is easy to use and the camera take great pictures even in the dark Just lover all the features Let me first say I am a fan of Samsung products But not the S7 Edge I do love the ability to add memory the camera is the best one yet and the battery life is pretty good Also love the fast cordless charging But all of that is overshadowed by how AWFUL it is to actually use this phone due to the curved edge Its sensitive to touch along the edge so you can only hold it by the corners Forget giving it to someone to take your photo  they touch it and theyve either accidentally closed the camera app or opened up others simply because they tried to hold your phone 

Also it overheats a lot Like too hot to touch for more than a second or two

And while wrapped in glass may look nice now you have the front AND the back to worry about cracking Ando good luck finding a case that fits and looks decent Ive had every Galaxy but the 5 This is the greatest one so far I have Verizon so I even get free tech support The camera is great I use it alot I am so thankfull they gave us back the memory card The screen is great with the colors also This phone is fast and I love it It even charges fast Its packed with features and its easy to turn off the ones you dont use Have had it for a week  Incredible improvement on image quality  Differences we continue to learn about but are very happy with it  Verizon reception at my home still stinks but the phone is great I really like this phone  I previously had an S6 which received water damage and could no longer be used as a phone  So glad to be able to purchase the S7  I would have given it 5 stars but the information for setting up the S7 was sorely lacking and frustrating Not to bad the screen protector makes it hard to get the right button without pressing very hard Solid design easy to use Intuitive interface Great phone My first purchase had dead pixels The replacement has been working great thus far I am just anoyed that i was not given the free gear for purchasing the phone like website stated Other than that the only thing I do not like is that the battery cannnot be changed The new Galaxy S7 has an even better display and faster processing The phone feels amazing to hold because of its curved back and glass texture The screen provides very vivid images and very sharp video Upgraded  to the S7 so far I love it Its so fast more than my last note 4

Im so happy Samsung customer
Only I need the tablet and de 360 camera for lam life its better Much better than my previous phone the galaxy s4 Way more sleek  clean Better features I am very happy with my phome This phone has some great features on it The thumb print identification works great much better sound quality and great picture quality Only complaint is the battery runs down very fast so I have to always have my charger on me Pretty decent features However immediately downloaded the Google Launcher Much better than TouchWiz honestly Just got it so will revisit this when I use it a bit more Yaya this phone is awesome I bought the phone this month and its awesome I was hesitant on buying the s7 because of some of the reviews I read about the battery life but I can say this is one of the best phone on the market I went from a s5 so the transition was easy no problems with the battery life for me my wife has a iPhone 6 and I think the s7 last longer Despite the unexpected flaw on the Galaxy note I found this to be the best phone ever own by me I loved the features as well as the eye scan and other security features I was very disapointed when I had to trade for another S7 I hope my wait for replacement will not be long I will be the first in line to get my Note back Valued cell phone I wish I could be little bigger in size Battery life camera functions and clarity waterproofing what more could you ask for This device rocks Purchased the S7 last weekend and love it so far I havent been on a Samsung in over a decade and Im just as pleased this time around Too bad the unbreakable screen protector crackedin my pocketwhile walking to work Not a Samsung issue but that manufacturer will get an earful I am in love Not mucheese different than the 6 but so far so good I was in love with the 6 as well Bought this a couple weeks ago getting used to it But all in all great phone Very easy to use simple and elegant Will be recommending to my peers LOVE this new phone No dropped calls beautiful and crisp images Takes great pics and is light years ahead of the previous models Keep it up Samsung you have a lifetime customer  I have returned to the Verizon salespersons at 2 different locations and have called the company several times  Everyone answers the questions that I ask but there are always more questions and no way to find answers on my own The phone has made my life more complicated not easier Not that much different than the s5 I got this phone a month ago and so far i like it No surprise here It does everything it promises it would I bought this phone because it was smaller than many of its competitors and it has top ratings and great reviews Ive had it for two weeks and it has performed very well to date Compact and excellent design that fits well in my hand

Battery life is solid but could be better

The camera iso incredible Absolutely one of the best on the market Performance and usability is top notch Phone is fragile but ok This phone is very well rounded There are phones on the market that have better specs in one area or another but you will not find a phone that covers all of its bases like a Samsung And the range of customers this device and its brethren in its model year can support is fenominal It can host a beginner who has never picked up a smart phone with features like easy mode and the hints and help messages when you first start the phone To the expert like myself with the wide range of options and performance adjustments As well as the seamless integration between phone TV apps etc The 12 megapixel camera isnt the strongest on the market but the enhanced features of the camera and photo app make it one of the best and easiest to use The 4 gig processor isnt the fastest on the market but combined with the 32 gigs storage an SD slot for additional storage and the additional performance features as well as being able to charge wirelessly and being dust and water resistant more then help push it into the number one spot A lot to learn after my windows phone Still figuring things out I had the Google nexus phone before I got this one and holy cow
 idk how I was able to use that when there was so much more to discover thank you this phone is awesome it has great features the screen is amazingly sharp and bright battery lasts all day and then some speaker is loud and clear and has some of the best accessories ive seen

huge improvement over my last phone also its a great feeling not having to worry about your phone getting wet  I really am liking this phone The colors are great The screen is super responsive Apps run beautifully The biggest down sideis that sometimes its hard to hold the phone without bumping something on the edge I switched from iPhone to 7 edge it is awsome and just easy to use it wish I switched long time ago Battery life is not as long as I expected Im getting about 45 hours until I have to plug in Also the touch pad when I swipe to write is not as sensitive as the old model new phone keeps dropping numbersincoming and outgoing calls drop in a few secondshave returned to the store twice to have someone fix the phoneeach time I am told problem is fixednope not truetoday the NEW phone had to be fixed again I have a been a Samsung user since the s2 came out they have always been top notch in the phone and tablets business The s7 is as good as it gets the sdcard return is a big seller to me the s6 was an awesome phone but it didnt have the sdcard option and that was a down fall for it The s7 is fast sleek design camera is the best out there Pictures are outstanding Take note Apple you can learn from Samsung I like the new Samsung Galaxy 7 but there has been some bugs along the way with the operating system Overall it is a nice phone and would recommend it as a good buy Has great battery life Love the camera catches great action moves I was very happy with my S4 it did all my calling and messaging with ease Now with my S7 and Gear 2 smartwatch I can call text and take outstanding photos even in lowlight The two mesh together seamlessly bringing my information to hand as quickly and easily as I can request it Ive had my phone exchange about 2 weeks now  Its okay I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and I love it Still discovering all of the features The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is hands down the best phone out there In my line of work I am required to use other brands The feel features power and the quality are here I love the Galaxy S7 Edge and I recommend it to everyone So far so good  Better than previous phone I really didnt want a new phone but I dropped my other phone and it broke So I guess after 4 years it was time for an update Some subtle changes but great device The S7 was a simple and pleasant transition from my S5 It kept all of my contacts  retained all of my previously sent text messages and my calendar notations too I must say I am very glad that Samsung maintains close continuity with their Galaxy S series phones Its very similar to the Note 7 but smaller and no SPen I love Samsung products the Note 7 was my 3rd Note phone and wont be the last Looking forward to getting the replacement The S7 Edge is still a great phone Since I had to return my note7 this is mostly the same But its not a note7 a much better phonewell other than the battery exploding part LOVE THEM ALL ALWAYS INOVATIVE FUN AND RELIABLE Ive been a big fan of Samsung products for many years In fact I was so happy with my Galaxy S3 phone that I never imagined I would ever trade it in but thats what I did I bought a Galaxy S7 and was immediately blown away It has many innovative features and I consider it to be the best bang for the money phone I highly recommend this phone This is my third Samsung Galaxy and I have loved all 3 I have had a Samsung Galaxy since they came out and love how easy they are to learn Looks really nice The screen is so clear and bright However has difficulty loading apps at times gets very hot while using the fast charge Just picked this up today and I am loving the camera performance on this phone The colors and clarity are better than anything I have ever seen The size and shape of the phone are perfect in that they balance a userfriendly screen size with a slim overall profile The apps run smoothly and the battery life is impressive All in all I am incredibly impressed with this phone Great phone packed with features I edge is awesome Bought the note 7 and got this as replacement I love this phone just upgraded from Galaxy 6s and i have to say this is better the clarity on screen is awesome So easy to bring data photos and apps over with Smart Switch too Love my new S7 Wireless charging is great Phone takes incredible photos Also love the pulse sensor for taking easy selfies This phone rocks I was a little disappointed in the lack in variety of cases available though Limited colorsdesigns for S7 cases in stores Also battery life is a little shorter than my old phone but this is why car and portable chargers are awesome  Love the galaxy phones Much better than the iPhone Hard to choose between S7 and the Note The S7 won out Only thing missing is the stylis pen It was easy to transfer information over from my S5 to the S7 but it seems to connect really slow in large crowds For example I was trying to connect to Pokemon Go at the same time the guy next to me was he had an S6 He connected and mine would not connect It was so slow in connecting Not sure what the problem is I thought is was supposed to be faster Other than that I have found it to be a good phone sleek in its design Just had it for 2 weeks Still discovering stuff about it Had the phone one week and loving it I am very happy with the overall performance The operating system is secound to none The battery life is ladting better than any other phone i have ever had Now keep in mind i just switch from Sprint to Verizon And with that said the difference may be partly due to the carriers available towers For example Sprint was always surching for service But i am very happy with the phone I switched from Samsung S6 to the Samsung S7

I thought I loved my S6 but I love this one too 

It is my 3rd Samsung Beats the iPhone Phone is ok at this point in time Ive had this for about a month  It was easy to transfer all of my stuff as I have Google  The phone battery is supposed to lay longer than the S6 but it doesnt seem to Verizon was nice enough to put me on this device till the Note 7 mishap is all cleared up Over all the phone has pretty mush the same feel in hand just a little smaller Very impressed with the 7edge
Last eight or so years with iPhone
I dont think I will be going back Just got my upgrade from and S6 to the S7 and Im glad I did  Aside from the fact that I can add memory when needed the phone performs wonderfully  Great camera great voice quality and just the right amount of the little extras that make is better than the S6 The new Galaxy S7 works fine it just took a while to get used to the newer layout and it did not import some settings correctly and some apps lost their configuration completely I like it because after having a s5 transition was easy Works well with my gear also This phoebe is a replacement for my note 7 After using notes this phone is to small for me The phone hearts up quick I was expecting a whole lot more with this phone but its not much different from my galaxy 5 Its not any faster as far as internet speeds and one of my fav remote control apps doesnt even work on this one Just another expensive phone I like the looks and uses of this phone The S7 is a great upgrade from the S5 however the battery life is not much better than the 2 year old S5 Disappointing All the features are great I bought this last week and am so happy that has a phone with so many great features and such a great look I dont like that I cant assign different notifications for each persons text On my old phone family members had their own tones to let me know who is texting me so I know how quickly I need to get back to them Now I have one for everyone even though I have a different tone assigned to family Great Phone Camera is amazing Fingerprint recognition is spot on I came from an S5 samsung which was the best phone I ever had This one is even nicer and the fingerprint login is so much better  My older Samsung S4 was no longer charging or took a lot longer than it should so went with the upgrade available I am so glad I did This S7 is a much better phone easier to use The camera on it is better has clearer pictures more pixels more options for schemes in taking pictures I went through 3 phones before finding one that didnt overheat Poor signal on my usual driving routes but once connected with a good one the HD calling is great Purchased this phone to replace and S5 and love it Not worth the extra 100 for the S7 Edge Only wish it had the same battery life as the Note 5 I had the Note 7 until the recall I decided to go with the S7 Edge as I rarely use the pen with the Note also never used the eye scanner I like the size is a little smaller and fits better in the pocket I am really glad I picked the Galaxy 7  It is easy to use and has great features  It also has a great phone I love this new phone Overall pleasure Would do business again Bought a few weeks ago and is a great phone Okayeveryone I am a All timeFan of Very many SamsungProductsI haveAlways had Samsung mobileI have recently ungradedFrom my s5 to the s7I am proudvery proud of the Samsung Galaxy s7OVERALL deviceWith a awesome materialdesignPreformanceIt isTerrificDont waitGet you 1Its awesome  I recently switched from a Samsung S4 to the S7 So far this phone is great the camera processor  look of the phone is far superior I love it Ive only had the phone for 1 day so I really dont have much more to say about it right now The best phone you should buy Its easy to use helpful and has the best technology I thought Id try an iphone when I went to upgrade this time Although always a Samsung user I thought they couldnt be that much different right Wrong I tried to give the iphone a chance and used it 9 days and then had to switch back to my Samsung The longest 9 days of my life The only thing I liked on the iphone that my samsung doesnt have is the recorded voice mail where you dont have to dial in to get your messages My Galaxy S7 is by far the best device I have ever used It has way more capabilities and features that I could have imagined The only thing I find it lacking is the IR Blaster to use as a remote like my S4 had but is still the best phone Ive ever had I love this phone I had an S4  went to the S7 when I upgraded In a short time I was completely up  running with all of the information I need to keep my life ontrack back at my fingertips The user interface is quite similar to my old S4 with a few minor changes  the changes arent improvements nor are they detractors Theyre simply different You will want to turn notifications off for most of the extemporaneous apps unless you want alerts allll daaay looong Great device for my personal use I would be lost without it Thanks Samsung for a very handy device Love the camera  has a great lens and edit features Just switched from iPhone and was not sure that I would be ok with having one of our family devices  off the grid so to speak but samsung has all of the linking issues covered and I am enjoying my phone Just purchased a few days ago so this review is based on first impressions To start the fast wireless charging is impressive and well worth purchasing the additional accessory Impressed that it works through the case

Display is clear and bright and touch responsiveness is outstanding Call quality is excellent although Ive just used it in a major city with excellent coverage The camera is better than any i have ever used Enjoy the rapid charge and waterproof features I love the phone its set up nicely Only minor things I would have wanted different My last phone was the mega so I miss the size and I was able to put apps in folders on home screen I would really love to put my pix into folders based on personal preference and be able to editadd more to it The mega had this feature minus being able to add more later But I still love the phone Im a die hard Samsung customer My computer monitor is but I cant afford the tv or Id definitely have it as well Ive been a Note user for years when i could no longer be one I went to the S7 Edge I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and functionality of this S7 Edge Battery life seems to be really good and its speed is awesome too I like the ability to change the standby time settings to display different ways So much this phone can do can you really just call it a phone anymore The phone is very easy to use and I love the look of it too Had to exchange my Note 7 in due to recall but S7 Edge is a very good second chose Cant wait to get my Note 7 back Love Samsung products will always buy there cell phones
The company decision on the recall just proves its a great company I chose this phone because it was the closet thing to the note 7 The att rep tried telling me the inky difference was the pen That was not true at all I personally liked the feel of the note 7 better my cell coverage was better loved the extra security with the iris scanner My quick notes via the locked screen the sound quality from the note 7 was better Sorry Im just not as happy with this phone If you never had the note 7 then you would not miss the differences But if you had the note 7 and played with it at all youd know the difference I love Samsung phones and want my note 7 back it was the best by far I Love this phone compared to my old S4 but one problem I have with Samsung is that they Update their sofware rearly a few months after android itself gets an update still out on the fence about this one Had a nokia lumia and it seems it was easier to use One really annoying thing is a samsung banner for apps keeps appearing off and on at start up and about any other time example samsung pay etc wish they woudl stop galaxy essentials keep popping up when i want something ill get it I have MS and the S7 is one of the best phones I have had The only problem I have ever had is it was very hard to hold on to until I was able to get a case The smooth shiny back is slipperyand having MS affecting my hands I had problems When I was finally able to afford a case that made the S7 be the best phone I ever had Thank you Ive owned Motorola Droids for years so I was a little skeptical when I got the s7 edge They didnt have the Motorola that I wanted in Stock so I took the s7 till it came in Liked this phone so much I didnt want to give it back This phone is awesome Straight forward design matched with speed makes it great for young and old Overall like the phone Missing a few features from the s5 but still adapting I have love the S series of the Samsungsame and I had the 6 edge the 7 is a definite better feel and more features When they first came out with the edge I didnt think I would ever need the edge features but now I could not live without it I LOVE MY PHONE I always had a Samsung phone and this one is by far the best The best phone I have ever had Has many great features and uses Samsung continues to raise the bar on the quality of their products Each one is better even though its seems to be the best already My household has completely converted to Samsung phones and tablets I am new to ATT and my salesman was absolutely the most honest and helpful person I have already sent 3 friends to go see Jeffery Upgraded from an S5 Overall happy Had a few issues with the transfer so Im still working on getting everything set back up Was told everything would transfer Most did
Power button is in a slightly different location so I keep accidentally hitting it A couple of features from the old phone I do miss This thing looks great and is much faster than my old S5 She runs a little warm but thats my only complaint The phone will turn on apps when I have it in my pocket the phone is very sensitive it will switch between apps that are open and other apps 
The device changed my keyboard from the standard Qwerty to a smaller version making it difficult to text or place calls

I really miss my Galaxy 6 Plus edge this Galaxy 7 would not be my first choice for a new device but performs ok as a replacement device the s7 edge is like have a desktop in your pocket Love that the screen is so clear and has ano awesome camera Received this phone due to my note 7 recall I miss my note 7 but this is a fantastic phone and Samsung is doing all they can to make it right for me
Im happy with my phone and with samsung Bought phone a week ago  it is absolutely terrific Great phone Battery could be a bit better and it tends to get really hot Camera is amazing I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 It is way better than the IPhone that I swapped from I highly recommend this phone Love the water resistant very fast Light weight cant beat it Pleased with battery life  like the size excellent display  bright and sharp  enjoying the wireless charging I love my new S7 phone I am still making my way around it since Ive only had it a week but I had an S3 for quite a few years and it seems very similar to that except faster and longer battery life Its easy to get around in Im 57 years old so it has to be easy to work I love it I absolutely love my new phone I have owned Samsung for years but this phone is a step above the others I have owned Very happy with my choice of the S7 Edge just like the note 7 without the risk of a fire LOL Same great features and longer battery life more talk more videos more everything I LOVE SAMSUNG Great phone great value the screen Clarity and the brightness is better than of any phone Ive ever had its userfriendly and and the amount of memory that comes with it when you get the phone its great to start off with I would highly recommend this phone to anyone This is a great phone Its sleek and gorgeous The Edge can be a little hard to get used to but the features are great Overall I am very happy with it I just wish it was a little cheaper Swapped out my note7 for this phone and I really like it Smaller with the same results This is the first phone I have owned with all of my favorite features Wireless charging notification led easy turn on wave and the fingerprint scanner top the list Add the micro SD card great camera and carrier unlocked to the list and it became my best phone ever Easy turn on would be better if the phone did not have to be perfectly still and of course the price was higher than other androids Overall the new Galaxy S7 turned out to be the best phone for me Love Samsung Pay has many available applications and long battery life It runs way more smooth then an iPhone tor mefeatures are very helpful and cool and the camera is the best 

Samsung took their time and did well with this phone I had to exchange my Samsung Note 7 For this Galaxy 7 Edge and It is almost as good as my note 7 but I did not like that it does not have the retina reader the charger slot was the old one and not the new generation  and the size forget about the pen this is good but not to make any difference but I really love the note 7 much better even though this is an excellent second option Great phone easy to use and lots of features and camera is available even when screen is locked When my Note was recalled my dissappointment was short lived when i experienced the 7 edge Although the screen is slightly smaller the features are unbelievable The dissapointment is over I had to turn in my Note 7 because of the recall so Im using the S7 until I get a replacement I do love it its basically the same phone but smaller which I actually prefer because it fits in my hands female so much easier BUT I miss the stylus and that alone is worth going back to the Note 7 Plus the water resistance is better on the Note 7 But since Im forced to have a temporary phone the S7 is pretty wonderful The only mayor thing I dont like is the edge of keyboard is hard to use when typing message The curve is in the way of typing Three weeks after purchasing the Galaxy S7 my screen cracked when the phone slipped from my hand and onto the concrete I was disappointed as I just traded a Galaxy S5 that had taken a number of falls and was traded without any defects I love the Galaxy S7 The features are fantastic but the construction of the screen falls short of my expectations of Samsung I love the galaxy line of phones and the S7 edge is great The only issues are the price and perhaps the edge of the screen is slightly to sensitive The Galaxy S7 Edge is a well made good looking phone However it does have a few drawbacks that need to be considered  First while it does have a slot for an SD card that card can not be used as Extended Memory basically extending the internal memory of the phone to include the SD card without a work around leaving it to be just Portable Storage where it can be removed and used in another phone or computer to transfer stored data natively That to me is a big drawback of this phone as it effectively nearly defeats one of the best features of Marshmallow  I have used the work around and that does seem to work well so for me the problem has been solved In addition the Back and Recent Used buttons are reversed from what I have become familiar with on other Android phones which presents a bit of a learning curve when initially using the phone and some amount of confusion if you change back and forth with another phone  as I sometimes do 

Beyond those two major drawbacks Ive found the display to be very good better in fact to any other phone Ive recently used I cant say much about the native UI Samsung provides as I use one of the Launcher apps found in the Google Apps store  the same one on each of my Android phones so UI on all are basically the same I got the S7 Im using from ATT not unlocked so it is loaded with all the ATT that are bundled in and cannot be removed Thats not necessarily so much a problem with the phone as it is a problem with the carrier but it does impact how a user views the phone

I would recommend this phone to other users with a strong recommendation that they get it unlocked if available for their carrier Ive stayed away from Android phones because their voice quality is shallow and muddy  The S7 is a real exception  Call clarity is topnotch its almost Blackberry quality and a huge improvement over my last Android phone Galaxy S3 As for the rest of the phones functionality theres nothing special  The screen is bright and viewable in the sun but other than that it  runs like any other Android  It  is terribly slippery and fragile so a bumper case is a requirement before putting it to use  But the terrific call quality is worth the premium price Samsung keeps on making great phones and so far I love my galaxy s7 edge Everything is soo smooth and never glitches I definitely enjoy the graphics on this phone and the quality it has when using it to watch movie and great camera It takes great pictures you can see out in the sunlight its easy to learn its a nice looking phone also fit in your pocket nicely I love using hi Galaxy you can just speak into the phone and it would do so many things for you The phone is really nice the silver titanium color is amazing it also has amazing features Great phone easy to use best camera out there today Nicely designed phone very easy to use all settings are intuitive Great phone and great company overall I just love it No screen protector tempered glass or not works on this phone I love the slight curve but it makes it difficult to keep the screen protector from cracking

I love the ease of this phone Its very easy to understand and there is a help function for about everything I love the fact that I dont need a few simple apps like flashlight and alarm clock Went from the note 4 to the s7 edge Nothe sure it was worth the money I really wanted the note 7 But they recalled it before I could get it The edges on the Galaxy S7 Edge are very clean and the aesthetics are both ergonomic and stylish The camera is very responsive to many different environments and is especially impressive at capturing crisp images at night in lowlight conditions I would definitely recommend this phone for any photographer from an amateur to a professional outdoor landscape expert The latest Android software makes the S7 Edge very intuitive and customizable too I traded my recalled Note 7 for an S7 Edge and I really enjoy the phone but I wish the always on functionality of the edge was that of the Note 7 which features notifications Other than that Im satisfied I would recommend this to friends and family members Always been a great phone Just got my Galaxy 7 to replace my Note 7 Hated to exchange it because there was no problem with it Never warm even with a cover on

Got used to the S Pen and the S Note app that I wish the 7 had them as well

I do love the smaller size of the 7 though This is my 3rd Samsung Galaxy and it is the best one yet I love the size and the the fact that it is water proof I love the expandable memory so I can carry all my music with me And the camera is amazing I cant believe the amazing pictures This is truly a great camera Note seven is better Too small of a phone and this is for kids or beginners Best phone I ever bought hands down No problems Sleek design takes clear pictures though would like more picture edit options otherwise a great phone with excellent features I upgraded from an S4 The s7 Edge is a great device that serves my needs well I love the flexibility of the device along with the compatibility with other devices ie the gear watch  oculus rift etc Battery life is a big improvement I picked this phone up as a replacemeny only because of the Note 7 recall It seems to be OK so far Pretty fast response bright screen and lightweight The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best of the S series yet First time My old cell was a flip phone Learning curve Going from S5 to S7 there are some new features Updated from a Straight Talk Grand Prime S5 to the Galaxy S7 Excellent phoneespecially the 32GB internal memory and the higher SD GB storage was told up to a 128GB SD So far no complaints and it has proven to be a lot better than the one I had even though I had to switch from Straight Talk to Verizon had Straight Talk service through TraqfoneVerizon Only issue I can see is if there is a problem and the battery needs to be replaced within the next two years so far The blu tooth has a hum like a electric motor feedback
The edge axtivation tab should be able to be adjusted to protrud more for ease of access The alarm volume should be independent of other volume adjustments The wireless FAST CHARGER takes 3 HOURS NOT FAST Volume in all areas is lacking This phone is a delight to use It is a beautifully built phone I upgraded my Galaxy 5 Stocker which was a mistake My Galaxy7 has more features but poor performance People I talk to cant hear me and I often have to put it on speaker so they can Plus I get dropped calls DAILY I have returned two phones due to these problems and my current one still has the same problems No problem so far enjoying it newfeatures and good service I have been using it for about 30 days and I do like the overall performance One thing that concerns me is the fact that this phone does get WARM when using various apps such as Google Maps taking photos or playing a game on it I like the way it feels in my hand as well as the placement of the buttons on the side of the phone It takes great photos and the battery life is much improved over the Galaxy S 6 Overall Im pleased with the Samsung Galaxy S7 I had the explosive Note 7 and had to trade it in for the Edge S7 Not a bad trade Im actually liking the cheaper cost and almost all the same features minus the Spen Not sure if I will be trading back up to the Note 7 or not even after they take care of the battery issue Bought this phone 3 weeks ago The battery life is horrible  Can only last half a day which is very inconvenient   Charging takes longer than the galaxy 5  Not a fan of how to insert the sd card     Everything else seems like the galaxy 5 I had the 7 within 2 weeks of introduction When I called for support  the techs were very honest in saying they had not been fully train and did not have their Mock Ups However we were able to navigate through the initial problems together I have used your support team for over 2 years and they are great 2 days ago I could not record my greeting on my phone the tech this time was secure and had his Mock Up This was quickly accomplished and spent time going over some security features that were not set As with all techs he was above and beyond If you are concerned about greeting a hot off the press phone such as the 7  dont worry  you have a great support team behind you I have been impressed with the Edge 7 In moving from a Galaxy 6 I wondered if the edge would be to much phone for me Thus far it has been phenomenal 

So far the features and the smooth operation have been impressive I like the feel of the screen and its responsiveness

The battery life seems strong but Im still putting it through its paces The wireless charging seems effective as does the fast charging

I really like that it has a headphone jack  Ive had the s4 s6 and now s7 Features and layout are about the same as the s6 so is an easy upgrade to get used to It is however completely different as far as the processor ram and screen clarity Im more than happy with my new s7 Nice phone I upgraded from a Note 4 Very happy with this phone Really fast Wheres the speakerphone option I would think it would be common sense to offer a speakerphone to tap onoff when calling or receiving calls but its not on the dialpad All other features are terrific The edge screen just makes it easy to hit with your fingers and worst of all I had it 2 months and it crashed Then they sent me a refurbished one when I had just bought it brand new by snail mail so it took a week to get Phone works phenomenally otherwise This is a top class device The features are top notch and the performance and functionality match I would definitely recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge My Samsung phone is pretty nice I like the battery and screen Also I like the new features and things it comes with The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is an awesome phone The many features included are great I really like the ability to access data from the edges of the screen Battery dont last all day like my 5scant get the pop up to stop coming upand have people tell me that I cut out and cant hear menever had that problem before I am impressed with the beauty and functionality of this phone Am still learning my way around android system My service provider store reps did the setup and transfer from my last phone and also installed the strong protective screen guard in the event the phone decides to inadvertently take a ground flight 
Photos are VERY impressive camera is stable NO blurs Love the camera
The S7 Edge is perfect weight feels like high quality Paired easily with my Bluetooth devices seamlessly
Busy exploring the apps and all the amenities of the device
Also located a really nice back protective jacket in the exact same color of the phone Didnt want to cover the beautiful Gold back This phone is alright It is very similar to the Galaxy series I had a S5 before and so this phone is familiar But I also had a recall on my note 7 and that phone was to die for So is this a good phone Yes Would I trade it back for a note 7 Yes Swapped for this phone while waiting for note 7 and feels good This S7 Edge smartphone is awesome Its feature rich and compatible apps make this upgrade so easy to use I also have the wireless charging pad for convenience Really like the fact that its a better phone with less to learn moving from 05 to 07 Very comfortable in hand Love the versatility of personalization Very fast compared to my previous phones
Great camera Intuitive sleek and fast Love the wireless charging as well Edge menu is great This is the best phone iv had It has a nice slick look and bright screen snd durable when I first held the Galaxy S7 Edge only thing I can think of was how wonderful it fit in my hand perfect the typing on it and everything is just perfect smooth flow good battery life great camera simply amazing I recommend this product to anybody This is the third upgrade we have made with the Galaxy series We are happy with the added phone storage and external card slot Nice phone Transition to new phone was seamless  My only negative thought of the phone is the case it is very slick  It will slide easily out of your hand  I had to buy a clear case to alleviate the problem A perfect size and top performance  Great wireless charge I love my note phonesand I cant wait to have note 7 back I am fairly tech savvy and this phone has gone above and beyond for me The performance is phenomenal and the features are a dream come true Ive had this phone over a month now and Im still learning about its builtin features For instance all you music buffs there is a feature in the sound settings that allow you to adapt the speakers depth position and its amplification all to your hearing needs by taking a simple  can you hear the beep hearing test Its got a split screen Feature it even has s voice voice commands and s health actually takes accurate heart rate and O2 saturation via your finger on the infrared scanner on the back This phone has so much potential and capabilities its mind blowing Well done Samsung Ive had the phone maybe 3 days now and I love it So much faster than my 5 Styling is a whole lot nicer too Only downfall I see so far is since Im waiting for my case to come in the phone is very slippery without a cover 

Screen is like Im looking at a 4k TV The colors are amazing 

Battery life seems to be pretty decent and the fast charging is great but it makes the phone INCREDIBLY hot  almost too hot to even hold Nice thing is you can turn off the fast charging so you dont fry your phone I love this phone It was a little rough to get used to after being an iPhone user forever Now I wouldnt trade it for the world Absolutely one of the best decisions that I have made was to be a Galaxy Edge owner I had the Samsung 6 edge and I hated it I traded for this and it was money well spent It looks better runs better and performs 100 better Love this phone This phone is wicked fast and beautiful it needs a case because it is all glass exterior can break if dropped Once You Get Used To This Magnificent Piece of Technology The Opportunities and Places It will Take You Are Unlimited It You Sit Down And Spend Some Time With It  You Will Keep Finding Something New That You Didnt Know It Could Do I have had 2 previous versions of the Galaxy and this is by far THE best iteration Thanks for bringing back the removable memory and water proofing Samsung hit a home run with the S7 Edge I have had my S7 for about 3wks I am not loving it at all honestly dont understand all the high reviews Apparently most that review this phone are Samsung phone loyalists 
My last phone was an LG G4 my first LG phone ever  I would gladly go back to it albeit for mother board bricking issues I have had to reboot this phone multiple times due to lag or freezing up The call clarity as well as speaker volume is horrendous  The touchwiz user interface is terrible and antiquated  Feels and looks too much like an icrapper I would honestly go back to my 8yr old Motorola Razor instead of having this phone  Do yourself a favor and specifically choose a phone with superb call clarity as well as loud volume Camera is mediocre at best edited software I terrible no IR support and not so good battery life in my opinion 
You WILL be disappointed with the S7 I know I am Good luck The S7 Edge is nicely put together It is sleek fast and more Amazing have lots of Samsung products love them all Got this phone after trading in my Note7 Basically the same phone but the note has a sturdier feel Nothing too special about it had a grand prime before and its the same just faster Was hoping for more features more phone options The phone is perfect except for one thing  headphone jack should be on the top of the phone Im using the phone to do things Ive never done before with the phone which is pretty cool For example Im dictating this right now into my phone I am an android person and love Samsung devices I will recommend to anyone Upgraded from a Samsung S4 Mini
This phone feels like Ive woken up in a parallel universe Amazing display nice features Im looking forward to managing my financial work professor work and social media from a single device It certainly packs enough of a punch where I dont feel the need for a tablet I like the phone but it heats up The display is the best Ive seen The camera is great Expandable storage is a great feature However some very popular apps have consistently buggy releases on Android i love the new design faster and better one thing excites me is the edge design First and foremost I have a great deal of trust for Samsungs quality especially the Galaxy line of products and this phone definitely exceeds expectations This mobile device has unbelievable features waterresistance Dual Pixel camera technology and space for additional storage That alone had me sold For me nighttime shouldnt mean you HAVE to use flash or sacrifice picture quality so this phones ability to capture the moment naturally AND brilliantly is superb I appreciate that it supports many audio and video formats exceptionally quick charge times HD display resolution and an aweinspiring array of sensors All around fine piece of technology that will surely stand the test of time I recently got this phone I am surprised how much I like it Got mine on launch day loved it but found its way more delicate Pick up a lifeproof case Waterproof is great Love the 2click home quick launch camera Phone is slippery without purchasing case What is the point of being waterproof if not drop proof Typing the letters near the edge of the keyboard requires patience Software and features get thumbs up Edge ticker tape feature is only cool if you sit in a cubicle nall day and are prevented from looking at msn Awesome phone awesome service Lightning fast with awesome features Samsung brought me to android years ago and for that I think you Samsung With the S7 the colors are more vivid and the camera is the best yet Every action is so smooth you just cant put the S7 down Dont make a mistake with the IPhone and get the S7 You wont be disappointed This is a good phone not difficult to use The only thing that bothers me is it over heats a little I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from a Galaxy S6 Edge and am very happy I did It doesnt get hot at all like the S6 edge and the software seems better more user friendly The only complaint I have is that the glass is not strong enough I broke the back glass the first week I had it when I dropped it while sitting in a chair and was devastated because it shattered It should have a metal back for this reason Since then I have purchased a case and now you arent able to tell its cracked but I know Also I highly doubt its water resistant at this point Im looking into replacing the back glass but if its too expensive Ill just leave it like it is On another note the tempered glass I purchased at the same time I purchased the case didnt hold up to its hammer on the screen advertising because I dropped it again this time on its face and it shattered it On the upside I was able to remove the tempered glass without any damage to the screen so I would recommend getting one of those as fast as possible The downside of the tempered glass on the edge is that once installed if you have a case on your phone the edge tab is pretty well inaccessible until you learn how to apply the right amount of pressure at the right angle to get it to work Also its very heavy even without a case At night when Im laying in bed I often have to lay my arms down and rest them for a few seconds due to the tremendous weight of it But if you are reading this I urge you to get one despite the cons I just gave to you Im almost positive youll fall in love with your Galaxy S7 Edge just as I did I bought it last week and it is terrific I love this phone it does everything I need a phone to do and more and what am amazing camera The sleek design just makes the cosmetics of the phone so much better not to mention the lightning fast speed of switching app Only reason Ive had my phone run slow was because the WiFi I was connected to was very slow Great feel love the screen size and the edge feature is an added perk Upon using Google for information and reviews on the Samsung Galaxy S7 I read that the Fitbit icon would not work with the Galaxy S7 phone Yesterday I went to my wifes existing Fitbit account that she uses to record her steps each day I down loaded the app and it worked perfectly She is trilled that she can record her steps and follow her progress She loves the phone and is amazed at the screen sharpness vs on her S III that she used previously I love the capability of this phone but I can almost literally watch the battery tick downwards Maybe because I just switched from a windows phone and Im not doing something right Either way awesome phone Sharp looking phone Good build quality Works great Easy to set up Lots of features Quick charging Decent battery life Very good call quality Very good camera Excellent screen the best have always loved the Samsung products keep up the good work Just got it yesterday but I love it Ive had all of the galaxy phones except the S III I had my reservations about the edge so I decided to go with regular S7 in gold platinum Got a minimal cleargold case for it in store Also got 2 wireless charging pads one stander I guess what Im so tickled about was content transfer through Verizon Call logstextsnotepads etc So convenient LOVE all samsung products tvs Blueray playersmicrowaves and 14 years of cellphones from flips to smarts LOVE them loyal customer for life Have two Galaxy S4s still working fine We have three Samsung TVs a huge refrigerator and a tablet all Samsung products must pass a rigorous quality control test I have had this Galaxy S7 for two weeks so far its perfect I like the android operating system far more than ios and microsoft Phone is great but I cracked the glass back within 12 hrs of getting the phone when it slipped out of my pocket Edge is kind of gimmicky Nicest looking Samsung so far 
Fast processor 
Screen is incredibly HiDEF Only have had it for about a week and its a problem  Not intuitive at all  It seems
they have tried to improve it to the extent I dont recognize it from my old phone

Dont  like it Previously had an s5 which was good The s7 was supposed to have longer battery life which i have been disappointed with I have owned several Android phones and this is my first Samsung I like it over my last few phones The camera specifically is faster than my last few phones It feels like I could open the app and catch a picture before the event passes I was so looking forward to this phone As soon as I got it the gallery app on the phone to view my photos would not work The app crashes every time I try to open in And then after just 5 days of use the back of the phone shattered It had not been dropped and has a case on it and everything I am working on getting it replaced or repaired but I am incredibly disappointed in the quality of this phone It is clearly defective Only had this S7 for a short time but it was easy as easy getas to work with and its been nothing short of amazing I am very disappointed in the new S7 I have had 4 Galaxys now and have loved them all until the S7 I am really frustrated with a few things On day 2 of having it the face got a scratch on it and it never left my pocket There were no keys or anything in my pocket By week 2 there were more scratches on the front and just swiping with your finger can cause scratches on this phone They are very light scratches but Ive never had a Galaxy scratch because I take care of them 

I also dont like when texting and its putting totally different words in there for me I figured it had to learn me Nope Ive had this phone for less than 60 days and Im ready to get rid of it and go back to an S5 until they fix the kinks and put a screen that wont scratch when you swipe a clean smooth finger across it Im very upset at the S7 Iam still learning about the phone So far it has been great This is my first smart phone so even though quite efficient on computers it has taken me some time to learn how to use it My biggest problem has been how sensitive the touch screen is but Im getting better with it Glad that I started at the top because this phone can do it all Its the little things  Ring tones alarm clock works different signal weaker Verizon is getting 20 miter a month I HOPED THE S7 WOULD BE THE BEST AND IT DELIVERED THE CAMERA IS AMAZING THE PHONE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE ULTRA HD WELL WORTH THE MONEY I bought this phone a week ago and I am very happy that I did I recently switched from an iPhone to the Galaxy s7 Edge Just a better device More customizable clearer pictures and a completely better feel Not big with taking pictures but the camera is exceptional Very nice to be back to Android from windows phone and all it can do No comparison Just wish my battery would last one day at least trying to find ways to slow the battery usage This phone is so user friendly it didnt come with any instructions but you dont even need them Upon initially getting my galaxy turning it on I was instantaneously amazed at the quality of the screen and setup in comparison was a complete breeze

Been downloading and testing all apps I used to use from the app store and they not only install substantially faster they also play seamlessly smoother and look MUCH better 

Using apps for work even seem more practical than the Apples twist of them Needless to say if I had more money Id be buying and testing all their products So far I love them all Ive been a galaxy user from the exception and still are after all these years Both of my children have IPhone and told me I should join them but would not even though it is easier and cheaper to face time when they are out of the country I will stick with my galaxy I got this phone last week after reading lots of reviews and talking to friends that have it  I had an older model Galaxy before my previous phone and I really liked it so I felt like it was a good decision to go back to the Galaxy  I wish I would have believed almost every review that I read that talked about how bad the battery life is  I dont feel that I use my phone much  I dont stream music I rarely watch videos and if I do they are less than 5 minutes I check my email text and use a few social media apps  After 10 hours my battery is around 30with minimal use  I hate having to carry a back up charger with me wherever I go  Its not convenient and I know it will only get worse as the phone gets older  If you need your phone to last all day and you actually use your phone I wouldnt suggest this model I bought this phone a month ago and its very high tech and cool The only thing that is not so good about it are some typing glitches that have been present in previous galaxies as well This phone is great it has all the features you may need its very light weight and great design easy transition from the 5 All in in all it works ok Smoother Faster Very very disappointed that the IR blaster was discontinued with the S7 along with compatability wiyh MHL cable Way too much bloatware This phone is the right size for the job It has a large battery and is water resistant The s7 edge is snappy with amazing graphics and screen resolution The camera is quick top notch and takes the best pictures of any camera Its comfortable in the hand and the edge accommodates for both the left or right hand I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants power function expandable memory and anot overall great value Bought my first galaxy last year As soon as I saw the edge 6 I fell in love Also bought a gear 2 haha So I bought the edge plus haha Go big or go home right Loved the way it performed the way it felt in my hand Felt well made Upgraded from a BLU phone product then that fell and broke recently worst day of my life I already had my eye on the 7 edge though Perfect time to upgrade I thought to myself So I bought this sweet sleek Ness and just wow Even faster doesnt heat up on vr Quicker sleeker smoother water resistant Im impressed I just hope it lasted till the next surprise phone that comes out next year from Samsung Hooked for life Yours truly samsunglife I am finding that the voice to text for the S7 does not compare to that of the S5 I am a fan of Carmode but I was able to voice text with the S5 seamlessly while I was in my car The S7 hasnt gotten a voice text right for as long as I can remember if ever
The other disappointment is the loss of the IR blaster I liked being able to control my home entertainment system with a remote app from my phone
The processing speed is better and the battery lasts longer but if the S5 had those qualities that would be my phone of choice I am grateful for the return of the SD card port This phone has far exceeded my expectations This was definitely a worthy product to buy The improvements made not only to the hardware but also to the software is incredible and defeats its predecessors I bought the S7 because I was tired I have such a large phone It has exceeded my expectations The processing speed is great all of the capabilities and features are excellent well By far the best phone Ive had to date Its a breath of fresh air from an iPhone So many customization options I can really make this phone my own I have been with apple and iPhone forever but I have a Samsung tablet that I love so I thought what the heck why not cross over and I am so glad that I did This phone is so cool and has so many features Plus the camera is out of this world Its gonna take a little getting used to but so far Im in love Been a Samsung fan since the S series came out But have only started from the S2 Have had every phone in between up until the S7 and let me say I do not plan on changing any time soon I was a bit skeptical about the Edge display but once I started setting up and personalizing my phone I immediately fell in love with it and all its features Samsung Galaxy series just doesnt seem to disappoint as of yet Size and weight just right to be comfortable holding it with one hand
Since I am a Galaxy Note 7 customer and this is a replacement phone for me it has lots of the same features as the Note7 but what it has and the Note 7 does not have is the home button in the middle on the bottom The home button is great and important and this phone has it It has Samsung Pay and the ability to unlock using the fingerprint Nice secure features 
Con I like putting an emergency message on my lock screen and that does not seem to be possible on this phone 
On experience has me a little concerned It heat up considerably while scanning in my credit card to Samsung pay and during charging I may have to take it in to the store to have it checked Other than that it is a very nice phone Great phone Love it Definitely a must buy even for IPhone users Lol would never change I really liked my note 7 but galaxy edge is closest to it really like the look and performance of it only 1 thing I found thats glitch is on the vr headset if you take it off for a few and set it down it wont track any head movement I have to take the phone out to reset it but other than that love the phone Ive owned every Samsung Galaxy since the S2 Skyrocket on ATT Every S series every Note series this includes the latest S7 and Note 5 This S7 Edge is the best Smartphone on the Market Screen processing power internal storage camera etc I recently went on vacation with my wifes family which included her cousins boyfriend who is a professional photographer and in all situations which required taking photos when he didnt have his DSLR he was using my S7 Edge he has a iPhone 6S I felt so proud so be a S7 Edge owner at that point You really need to get this phone This phone is sleek and functional Coming from a Motorola Moto X I wasnt sure I would enjoy losing some of the features I had become accustomed to I must say this phone surpasses my expectations and definitely does not disappoint Battery lasts all day with mixed use and the lightning charger charges in 35 minutes from 10 I originally had a note 7 which I surrendered due to the recall Upon returning it it had to essentially step down in devices the galaxy 7 edge being the closest competitor Overall I think Id be more satisfied if I didnt go from a note 7 to this nice phone until my note 7 is replaced fixed s voice and number sync with support yahoo Over all this is a spectacular phone and is amazing quality Im just over all in love with this product it has made my life a lot easier Coming from the Note 5 I have no complaints and feel this is one of three best phones on three market Tons of useful features amazing camera and Im convinced I cant live without fast and wireless charging Bought through iPhone 6s Plus and couldnt stand it returned in less than 36hrs This is a great achievement in wireless technology I got the Galaxy s7 because I needed a phone that could handle more sophisticated apps when I got into grad school My old Galaxy Grand Prime was a great phone but just wasnt capable of doing everything I needed I got the s7  Cricket  couldnt be more pleased with the overall performance responsiveness quality of calls and even the pics I take turn out beautifully Its super fast and does several things  once without slowing down I still love that I can add extra memory with an SD memory card but there is plenty of memory on the phone itself to get you started Only drawback of course is the retail price but its well worth it Im still getting used to the update but am extremely happy with this Samsung Thought I would go with a smaller phone this time but now Im so glad I didnt Im not a techy so I have to look around before changing settings etc but this is pretty easy even for me excellent features very good camera with nice low light pictures lots of add ons
samsung pay is very useful and surprises people at checkout
extended storage waterproof
i have used this phone since it was launched and am very happy with its performance I have this phone now for a few months and so far so good I recommend it Sleek and nice and good function Great camera I am so very pleased with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge android phone and its operation Works fine and has some handy features that I like I am more productive because of them I am happy A dependable device with lots of neat extras I enjoy finding new helpful features the more I use it Just picked up the Samsung Galaxy S7 today Im still setting it up the way I like but I miss the tool box tool I like having my calculator handy I wish there was more of a color availability I love it still trying to get used to a smaller screen Had a note 4 and updown graded 

I dont like where the speaker is I always seem to cover it with my finger Its how everything I need in phone I just love performance of phone in clear picture Italian take I have had a few samsung phones the edge panels Samsung pay and the camera are great Love it I buy all my products from Samsung tvs and phones and appliances I love you Just upgraded Had the S3 then the S6 Now the S7 and its great Basically the best phone ever This phone is great very stylish Luv the size of the screen It has so many great features to pick just 1 I have had Samsung Galaxy Series phones for years and I love how durable they are My only real complaint about the S7 is the screen edge It wraps down just enough so that a tempered glass screen protector is never fully flat Other than that I am totally satisfied with everything else about the S7 I bought this for one of my children She used my current s7 with the curved edge quite a bit Her and I both cant stand the curved phone I wish this phone was available when I purchased my curved edge s7 It has great features and fairly easy to use I love the pictures it takes 
It has everything I need I recently switched back to Samsung Galaxy after using iPhone I bought the iPhone 6 for work downgraded to iPhone 6S I have previously owned all the iPhone introduced since the 4 I use the Galaxy S7 mostly for work 1 It integrates so well with my office applications but more importantly 2 it integrates very well with the Waze driving app I am in sales and use it frequently to navigate to sales calls Most importantly 3 it syncs seamlessly with my google contacts and calendar It is clumsy task to sync my google contactscalendar with iPhone I added the anydo app so now I can also easily add items on my task list and manage my calendar it all syncs simply with my PC laptop and notebook I could rattle off all the apps that open and operate flawlessly chrome pictures Adwords OneDrive etc Also love the widgets eg I have a timer on my home screen with memorized setting for brewing coffee one touch button to record todo list items Finally the ergonomics of the S7 are spoton The screen is a little bigger and easier to read the power button is well positioned and easy to avoid and the overall size fits easily into my pocket This is the best phone i invested in the price is very high but its honestly worth it all these new features is amazing I keep learning new things about this phone that i didnt know I could do My calendar did not sync with my Galaxy 3 so I had to manually input everything again I absolutely love the camera and video technology of the S7 as well as the size strength SIM card and how easy it is to use

My one and only complaint is the sound and when playing games or watching videos the speaker is located at the bottom of the phone so when watching videos or playing games I lose sound due to speaker location

Itd be a 5   rating if speaker was located on the side of the phone I purchased this phone because of the great pictures for my kids and familys pictures but when recording a video of my children sound isnt up to par

Id like to believe since the visualization is soo great its meant for convienence of great memories to hold but thats not the case with this phone 

Again great pictures but audio needs A LOT of help I bought this phone not too long ago and I love it This is my third Galaxy the 5 the 6 and now the 7 The 7 is so far ahead of the competition that it is remarkable I love everything about this phone I had an Apple IPhone 5c and then got this phone and I love all the features and design I love taking photos and it has amazing quality pictures I just love Samsung phones They are dependable sleek design and are easy to use I like the sleek look of the Samsung it is very durable I got the S7 E as a replacement of my S6 E and I am loving it I loved the 6 already but the 7 I like even more love the camera I like because is a little bit heavier and it feels sturdier than the S6E I really like my S7E The phone exceeds all my expectations The colors are vibrant and it sounds fantastic I really like how it performs all tasks are completed quickly I love the light weight of the phone and am liking the new set up for apps I came from a note 4 edge and got the S7 edge with an insurance claim The edge features are on the S7 are ok I seem to open apps every time I try to open the edge But its a great phone I really like it I love everything about it Great color and camera sound is great Hopefully the screen doesnt break easily Best products every day

Beauty 
The beast S7 I just got the phone yesterday but I havent had any problems so far Ive always loved my galaxy phones I love this handset It is very light weight and efficient I love it Camera is awesome I love being able to wash it with water I will only buy waterproof phones from now on I love the galaxy s7 I have had a lot of phones but this galaxy s7 is my most favorite Ive heard nothing but good things about this phone I was originally gonna get new iPhone SE but I found out about this phone the day before I got it and Im very glad I chose the galaxy S7 Edge As Im writing this review I had just recently upgraded from an HTC desire 610 so this phone is infinitely better Great phone cant say one bad thing about it my wife loves hers to I have used several different manufactures phones  top of the line however SAMSUNG beats them all hands down

I am also impressed with the integrity of the company I am waiting on my Note 7 due to the issue with the batteries They have provided excellent Customer Service Samsung for life I hope The vr is the best I love the phone all together I had issues with the Droid DNA and Droid Turbo I can unequivocally say that the Galaxy S7 32GB by far is SUPERIOR as compared to the Droid 

I am impressed with the battery life of the Galaxy S7 and how user friendly the Galaxy is 
Also the camera is awesome too pictures are beautiful 

The phone is sleek and sharp looking love the gold color  

Knowing that the Galaxy S7 is waterproof is a super feature I really like the ease of the phones functions as well This is a really nice phone Gaming is fun and the speakers are awesome The keyboard is not as easy to use as the note 7 because of the curved edge Its hard to get the 1 etc This is a great phone I traded a galaxy s6 for this one and I am glad I did the phone looks great and function perfectly The only problem that I have is that it wont sync favorites from my contact list Overall this is a great phone There are a few quirks like with any product The only negative I would say is its very hard to find a screen protector that fits with a case due to the curved edges You really have to work at getting the side apps to pull from the side I really love everything about it and it couldnt get no betta then the way it was made Ive had every galaxy since the s2 and the s7 edge is the best phone Ive had just wish it had the new usb 31 like the note 7 had It sounds like the person is right there Love the SHealth app and ability to keep track of all that stuff Works so well Love it has the best camera I love this phoneIve always bought Samsung  Had an older note which I liked the larger screen but only occasionally used the pen This was an upgrade to a new phone to replace that Its newer nicer but I miss my larger screen I have owned quite a few mobile devices and this one ranks the best I have had to date A very well manufactured phone I like the layout of the phone and also the different features that are built in the phone I have been using Samsung phone for a long time Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best With expandable memory and the function of water resistant the phone simply is the best Nice smooth fee1 Easy to find what you want Seems to be user friendlyso far so good I like the new S7 edge Its touchy on the edge ie difficult to type 1 and frequently get 2 
sometimes slow to reactas if its thinking
But overall a good product I love the phone I had an S6 as well Im not sure I would upgrade from a 6 to a 7 but I had to The S6 overheated and shut down Im a little concerned with the battery operation on these phones I liked them better when you could switch batteries Great phone for a year but not worth the upgrade yet This phone has it all Excellent camera display performance Sorry to disappoint but is not a note Have had 3 notes Had to trade my note 7 in But when the note 7 come back out in a few weeks I will trade back in Nothing like a note sorry  Dont compare to any phone  super fast  I keep all my business on it All manufacturer has set backs Thanks for standing up One of the best phones Ive ever had by far bar none The S7 Edge is hands down the best phone i have ever had It has an amazing battery that can power the beautiful display all day even with constant use The layout is super amazing and i love the inclusion of the sd card or gear fit 2 The only complaint i have about this phone is the price and the price of the accessories other than that this is an incredible phone and i am so happy i went samsung I recently upgraded from an iPhone 5S to the Note 7 but had to return that phone and get this one temporarilynonetheless it was still an amazing phone with a great camera great UI and excellent display I have had the new Samsung Galaxy 7 edge for 2 weeks now I upgraded from the galaxy 4 and love it Sometimes it does seem a little big for my hand but most of the time I love the bigger size I think this phone is awesome The camera is so nice and has other features as well to animate your photosand filters built into the app The phone is super fast Love the fact that they have pop up for messages Love the multitasking feature I did however change the keyboard and use the Google becaueue its more accurate  The customizations on the phone are so coolI Change my theme like every week depending how I feel  The screen is easily fooled on the edges when holding the phone but slap a case on and its a much better feel  You can customize the emails messages  over all look of the phone  The phone feels like an expensive top of the line device The camera takes unbelievable photos Even if you dont like the saturation the screen can be adjusted in settings I cant wait to see what the updates bring love this phone The battery life last so long and the phone charows super fast So far att network and no reception issues  Bluetooth and WiFi connect no problem Loving it  Phone seems stable well made and has features like my iPhone 5c did not waterproof expandable storage User interface takes a while to get used to coming from an iPhone but over all I am happy Be aware that if you bought a phone with a carrier like Verizon there may be a few things you could learn online about removing extra software and maximizing battery life I was a user of a competitor and made the switch to the Galaxy 7sand I have never been more pleased with a technology decision The processor is fasterthe battery lasts longer and the platform is more intuitive for my useage Samsung has gained a loyal customer I recently upgraded from my old S5 and im really glad i did Love this phn This is my first Samsung phone I love that it is waterproof but this camera is the best I have seen on any phone The clarity of the pics are better than my husbands iPhone and the videos are perfect I am more than happy with this purchase Great phone All you would want from a cuttingedge product But buy a good protective case I dont like the edge I wish I would have stated with the notes This is your far the best phone Ive gotten The performance is amazing Fast bright sleek This phone has it all Ive had this phone for a few weeks now and am so happy It actually has more bells and whistles than I need but thats okay I love this phone Easy to use and allows me the organization that I need My only complaint is that there are times when I am unable to adjust the media volume and that I am unable to exit Google play when the phone syncs to Bluetooth in my vehicle I have yet to figure out how to fix these two issues The phone is very good if not the best on the market in so many ways but the battery life really takes away from all that good 

I travel quite a bit for work and always find myself looking for a receptacle to plug into around 630  700 PM I love this phone Im so glad I switched to this from my iPhone 6s plus this is way better in my opinion I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S7 edgeIt has great performance and quality Very responsive and easy to use I would recommend this phone to all age groups I feel even if you are not tech savvy  this phone is easy to navigate 2 weeks in and it seems to be a great phone It has taken a little learning but so far I like it a lot My first venture into a Samsung phone Nice feel to the phone Great camerawith a huge number of options Just wish screen wasa little largerbut I guess I will livewith it Overall nice phone Great pictures so easy to use even for the tech challenged Long live the back button Love it Having a few issues The main issue sending pictures A lot of failures I got this phone when the note 7 was recalled I like the light thin phone and the display is awesome Changed from 4s only had a wk or so learning I have been so happy with the S7 edge It has amazing battery life takes great pictures and re charges super fast I have the Note 7 but in an effort to keep things from going boom around me I did the temp trade in for this baby I like it I love the gold shade and do wish that particular color was available for the Note 7 in the states But this S7 is a comfortable device that performs really well GREAT camera nice interface All around a solid phone All I have to say is superb this device is Simply beautiful I upgraded from a S5 to S7 and so far am really enjoying it  The camera and volume on the phone are incredible This is really a preliminary review since I just set my new S7 up I am moving from a Galaxy S4 The setup and data migration was flawlessly executed and all apps and data was migrated perfectly I have yet to use the phone but i am impressed so far with what Ive experienced Great phone with similar layout as other previous models Slight curve at screen edge caused the glass screen protector I bought at the retailer to chip I still havent figured out how no I didnt drop it easy to use very competitive wother brands like VR assy I used to have a s6 edge and didnt care for it Im glad Samsung listened to the their consumers and added things back in Bravo Samsung Bright display Durable Lightweight Builtin speakers
Love this phone works great Does everything I need it to do Just learning how to use it Its great so far for me I got this phone when I returned my Galaxy Note 7 because of the recall on the Note I like the S7 edge a lot At this moment I am thinking of keeping this phone instead of getting a new Note 7 when they are released with the new battery I would recommend this S7 Edge to all of my friends and family Love the phone and the sales associate Danny Evans was so knowledgeable and responsive to my needs Only had a couple of days but very impressed Easy to learn and navigate Really happy my wife and I  bought new phones  Never realized  how many improvementstudents in the phone over 24 months Love this phone works great Does everything I need it to do Easy to use no need to have the tech go over the entire guide Great product I would recommend to friends Love the people tab Battery life is not very good Hardly gets through the day and I am not using it that much Took this down to the lake and got some amazing pictures and video Love it I have had my phone for 1 week and must say I am enjoying the experience the service was great speed reliability on point I have no complaints The only things  I like about the new S7 are the longer battery life and the HD speakerphone Other than that its not any better I actually think my S4  was better than this its disappointing Great phone Easy to use This is my second Samsung phone and fourth Samsung device The phone came bundles with a Galaxy S2 watch Sadly both the phone and the watch arrived with defective SIMs so it was a couple of trips back to the store before everything worked I find the phone almost too thin for my hands yet the Spark case makes it too big Other than that  love the device The phone seemed great until I realized how poor the screen durability is I placed an Otterbox on my phone and even that could not protect the weak screen I dropped my phone about 3 feet and a long crack appeared on the screen I was very disappointed because my previous phone a Samsung Galaxy S5 had survived worse drops than that without getting a single scratch on it Later that day I check my phone and that single crack had rapidly expanded A single crack expanded to the point my entire screen looked shattered Worse phone I have ever had Wish I would have kept my old Droid Maxx This Samsung S7 takes FOREVER to charge and the battery barely lasts the day  It also keeps saying it is offline when try to connect to the Internet  My old phone never did that I am not impressed with this Samsung S7 Had an s6 edge and the s7 edge knocked it out of the park for Samsung Only thing I would change if I could is how the note 7 has the connections and settings options in the notification center I like being able to adjust my brightness on my flashlight and being able to access most of my settings from the notifications screen Got S7 edge to replace recalled Note 7 I had iPhone for a long time before I got Note Edge then to Note 7 Sadly I dont like S7 as much as Note 7 As soon as Note 7 is ready I am going back S7 is great compared to all my previous devices though with exception of Note 7
Great camera Easy to use functions Excellent display List goes on and on 
Only gripe is that messaging is slow and opening up Internet link from messages is slow too The phone is fast The camera is great It can get a little warm when charging One of the best features are that it supports wireless charging and that it has IP68 rating

The only negative is the glass back of the phone Im afraid it can be cracked and ruining the water resistance I might be the only person that believes that the lightweight plastic back of past phones kept it light and more durable I wish they would use a strong composite place for the backs of their future phones I chose this phone to temporarily replace my Note 7 after having that just one day waited a week after ordering received it the same day as recall So far Im enjoying the Galaxy 7 Edge It is sleek and powerful and waaaay better than the Samsung J3 I had initially Before that I had a Note 4 and dont see much difference between that and the 7 Edge but I havent set up my edge functions yet so I know that will make a big difference And then theres the pen that I really didnt use to its fullest advantage before 

So all in all the 7 Edge is great and when the Note 7 is again available I may have a hard time deciding whether to switch back I will say one thing though I will have a hard time ever switching to a nonSamsung phone After all my years of owning cell phones I am most satisfied with Samsung overall This phone has great overall design a great camera both sides wonderful screen and Google on tap is my favorite feature The Galaxy S7 Edge has been a rather impressive phone I was disappointed to see that they removed the IR blaster from the phone however I can still control my Samsung Smart TV with it Excellent tips and tricks on YouTube to take advantage of fingerprint the micro 
SD card for music  photos  even some apps I only got this phone because of the recall on the note 7 I cant wait to get my note 7back Had the S4 for quite a while and the S7 is honestly a huge upgrade Similar yet upgraded features and a nice size Just a smarter version of a smart phone Still a few kinks to work out but definitely 95 satisfied This phone is pretty and works fairly fast The front camera is not as good as the LG G4 but the back camera is great The battery does not last as long as I would like though despite being 3600 mah If the battery was better this phone would be near perfect This Phone will please anyone It has the best display on any cellphones the Android features and all that makes a Samsung great I like this phone but last week my phone got locked up and Samsung had to erase everything and reset everything back to the factory settings I did not lose any of my information But I use Google calendar and now it keeps telling me that I have to have the Samsung calendar on whenever I receive my notifications on my google calendar If the Samsung calendar is on I then get doubles of everything The people at Verizon have tried to get this corrected and even they cant figure this out  I did not have this problem before Samsung wiped out my phone and reset it The only thing its missing is the IR blaster This phone is great and has a lot of nice features The phone is so flexible to any needworkbusiness art communication Just got this bad boy and I love it so much its awesome Really good performance and quality research plus good battery and perfect sounds The phone has locked me out twice with the correct pattern as I was about to factory reset the phone decided to let me in the on the last try also I was locked out of my phone all evening because every time I would try it would make me wait longer a longer for each try definitely not a happy camper I like this phone for everything it is but to be honest its not my Note7 I m just using it until they rerelease the Note7 After loving my iPhone 4s for nearly half decade OK  thats embarrassing I knew it was time for something new The reviews for the new Note 7 were off the charts so I plopped down my money spent hours reconfiguring my new phone and learning a new platform only to have the phone recalled in less than 2 weeks 

I admit to some disappointment when I returned to the store to exchange my phone I chose the Edge because I was falling in love with the Edge feature and its sleek look 

The Galaxy S7 edge has quickly surpassed my expectations It fits better in my hand the operating system is a dream and the sound and picture quality are phenomenal I actually gasped yesterday evening while on the phone with a friend  the sound was SO clear No issues so far speaker is surprisingly good great display too Coming from a Windows phone it was a bit of a learning curve getting accustomed to this phone However I did find in time this phone can mimic some of the Windows phone but better While it has the Gorilla Glass it is still very breakable and from a short distance I know from experience Android system can be a pain at times in that settings changes may take several steps because various settings are in different locations I still havent been able to turn off the audible notification for Airwatch without turning everything off for Airwatch which is troublesome for work email I thought I would be disappointed to lose my Note 7 after the recall but this phone has proven to be just as good Love the edge display and the edge features and the screen is bright and sharp Super lightweight super thin I probably wont return this one for a Note 7 again I like it too much Ive been a fan of Samsung Galaxy since they first came out The phone is light weight and not bulkyhavent had any problems or issues with the phoneoverall great phonephone is durable The jury is still out as to whether I am an android convert after using iPhone for years It took me a week to get used to the Note 7 and I thought it might be true love but then well you know what happened I didnt want this phone but didnt want to be phoneless for an unknown period of time waiting for another Note 7 The display is clear and beautiful great camera I have very poor vision and there is an Easy Mode for Old Ladies like me that makes it easy to find what you are looking for I miss the larger screen on the Note Ive had a Galaxy phone since the very first Galaxy However Ive had one or so others since none in comparison to the overall function and style of the Galaxy phones The Galaxy S7 is no exception

 My last Galaxy was an S5 It had several drops that probably should have broke the screen as I didnt have a screen protector on it Then one drop did it It ended up being a hole in the top right corner of my phone Shortly after my son knocked my phone into water fully submerged I took it out of the water and just said Yep its done now Two minutes later my dad called and it rang and worked just fine I had that phone until now one year later The durability of the Galaxy phones is one feature I will never give up 

I love android systems and the Galaxy is the only way to go My Galaxy S7 is beautifully designed perfectly customizable and is performing to my expectations Oh and the camera I love it As a mother of two and a person who lives to travel and capture every moment this phone seems to do that PERFECTLY This is by far the best phone in the market had the opportunity to use other phones and compare them The only thing that I noticed is that sometimes it gets really hot mostly when Im listening to music or when using the navigation Not better then my note 7 was but it will do for now Ive had every galaxy s phone since the s3 and this is the best one yet Wouldnt go anywhere else but Google and Samsung Highly recommended The galaxy s7 is so easy to use The lay out and the way everything is set up some very logical I enjoy using all the different apps that it comes with like the same active I am so thrilled with my purchase My previous phone was Casio Gz One commando and had that for 3years Now Im having the most incredible experience with this light speed phone Everything about this phone is amazing The Camera the OS the themes avaliable Needless to say Im very happy with this phone I loved it so much I switched all my families phones toS7 Had a note5 Waited anxiously for the note 7 Upon recall picked the galaxy 7 edge Decisions decisions I am enjoying the phone Still playing with the apps So far it has been an easy  transition The firsty thing I noticed is the person i was talking to sounded like they were standing beside me My caller said the same thing on their end as well Best call I ever had Then I noticed how fast this Galaxy S7 was Wow Looking forward to other amazing discoverys There is no phone on the market that has so many features and can be so useful and yet durable as the S7 Water resistance Samsung Pay Super AMOLED display Gear VR expandable storage superb battery life super sexy themes I could go on There may be other handsets that are good for less but they just cant touch it The only things I would change are Make a better front facing camera its good but not the most impressive and make the camera be able to open in a specific mode like pro mode by default Had to turn in my note 7 and got this only thing I miss is the stylus This is the easiest phone I have ever used Ithe I very easy to store set up Love everything so far I love samsung pay and perfect in my hand and easy to use No matter what these devices will never fail always and forever be in love with Samsung Galaxy Really nice phone with awesome features Especially the edge features are really convenient Downgrading from the Note 7 Like the phone but I am totally missing the Spen and the big screen Other than being too small and not So Snote compatible I actually enjoy the phone Great display and picture quality Ive only had my new phone for a few days now and I must say I really like it The picture quality is amazing and although it took me awhile to figure out how to download pictures and music I am starting to learn how this phone works Im utilizing a lot of the apps that came with the phone such as the workout app and Im loving every minute of it Im very impressed by the Samsung product and I dont think i will ever go back to the iPhone Im loving this phone and all of the capabilities it has Just upgraded from the s5 so still have a lot to learn but loving it I have to say Samsung phones are great havent had any problems with any of the once I have gotten Would recommend Samsung phone I have to admit I miss my pen I had with my note 3 I chose the edge because the 7 note was recalled After a few days of getting use to the edge and its size I love it Everything is amazing The second health is different and I dont like that app now But over all the other features are great I love my Samsung s7 edge and would highly recommend it over an iPhone any day This phone has amazing features Allowing you to use the edge as an actual function has be incredible I would recommend this phone to everyone This phone has been one of the fastest phones Ive ever used It provides excellent support for all apps Well the real reason I have this phone is because the new note 7 was a bust I had it for about a week I had the note 3 and 5 both were great and the galaxy s3 so as you can see its Samsung all the way The battery lasts me 32 hours or longer without power saving mode The processor does whatever I ask with without hesitation the only misses I have found so far are the music player had to be downloaded and the endless scrolling is gone and I would have to install another launcher to get it back This is a great phone but I cant wait to get another note7 I have been extremely impressed with the S7 edge overall This is my 8th Samsung smart phone and definitely the best yet The camera is unreal and rivals my Nikon DSLR in many photoshoots My only real complaints are the high cost and fragility of the glass The waterproofing works very well but I would love to see a more shatter resistant S8 edge Replaced my Note 7 because of the battery issue I actually prefer the S 7 Edge better because it fits in my hand better I will not return to the Note 7 when Samsung has resolved the battery issue and redistributes the Note 7 to original owners The S 7 Edge lacks the S Pen and 32GB of memory but that is not enough for me to give back the S 7 Edge The S 7 Edge has all the features I use such as voice commands expandable SD card slot and connection services such as Bluetooth and Number Sync to connect my Gear 2 watch This phone is amazing Water resistant shatterresistant screen best battery life of any phone Ive ever had In addition it accepts a micro SD card up to 128 GB
The only drawback Ive found is the somewhat fragile back cover Its glass and not as tough as the screen Make sure you have a protective case for your phone right from the getgo As a lifeguard over the summer not worrying about jumping in with my phone was a lifesaver loterally I cannot out into words how satisfied with this phones amazing betterylife and not to mention the superb design It feels life it fits perfectly in ny hand I love my S7 edge Keep up the good work Samsung So this is my first samsung phone and wow it doses a ton more than my iPhone you have got a new customer for life the Samsung world is a way bigger world than the iPhone world Great display and design of the phone and is packed with great common features as well as awesome uncommon ones Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is definitely an impressive highend smartphone I upgraded to the S7 from an S5 I like the features this phone has to offer and it is very easy to set up It does everything and more I need a phone to do Great phone but I seriously cannot wait to get my Blue Coral Note 7 back into my hands Returned my Note 7 after a recall so decided to try the 7Sedge Very happy with it so far Battery is good lighweightlooks sleek Pictures are crisp  clear Great screen quality Do miss the SPenbut might just keep the 7Edge Also glad they went back to a SD card from the Note 5 Good overall
Not using any new features except the charging function
Like to be able to remove some of the bloat wear who needs NFL but that might be Verizon
It would be nice if they would just go ahead and make it waterproof put the case makers out of business Like I said once I learn how to use everything and I want to make sure Im not being charged for anything extra it seems like it had a lot of apps on it already and I want to make sure Im not being charged for those if I dont want them One of the best features of galaxy phones is the camera resolution and how easy is to capture amazing moments in pics that even zoomed and printed look amazing When I got my new Samsung S7 I was excited I loved the phone and used it a lot Worked awesome for a couple of months The phone died for no apparent reason I have had it replaced and am looking forward to using it I am hopeful it will last much longer because it appears to be a nice phone This phone has surprised me with the long battery life It has such great performance and brilliant screen that I was certain the battery would deplete quickly The always on screen and side display are great features This is a great phone its very sleek very nice looking pictures are beautiful very easy to use I really love it I would buy it again All in all good phone It has an amazing screen with brilliant colors fast charging good design etc Only problem I have is that the battery drains really fast I might just have a faulty battery but it drained two percent just writing this review The phone is beautiful Great features Fast performance I return my note7 for this loaner phone and its almost just as good as the note but without the pen If you dont need a pen this phone is for you and I am having second thoughts about the note 7 this does exactly what I want it to do I highly recommend this phone this is your best phone to date and I have enjoyed it totally Thank You I waited a while and then finally I updated from my old Galaxy S3 to this phone I absolutely love it Its the best looking phone Ive seen without a case It fits amazing well in my small hands and the operating system seems flawless so far It has a lot of features Im still find more options and updates regularly and my apps work a lot better than on some of my previous android phones My friend who has an iPhone 6 plus loves my new phone I would definitely recommend this phone I love the speed and display of the phone Clear pics and great battery life Screen is great The clarity is astounding Lightweight design Im so happy to say that the new galaxy S7 runs great looks great and the fast wireless charging port is amazing No wire mess or connection problem It charges super fast Just love it I choose the Galaxy S7 Edge because it wasnt to small and the unique look of itIts pretty cool and sharp I am awaiting on note 7 to come back out but after getting use to this I just might keep it I like the galaxy note better Samsung is a great company I want to know whats coming next year Probably the best galaxy yet and have owned 5 different ones I love my s7 best phone that I have ever had Battery life is great It is an enticing phone  I love to use it Had to return my Note 7 due to recall and I will probably go back to the Note 7 because of the stylus iris scanner and even larger screen Both phones are sexy and work great though Have a Galaxy S7 Edge right now as Im waiting to go back to my Note 7 when the battery issues are resolved ATT and Samsung have been awesome in response to this problem That said the Edge is sleek and small Ive had a Note 3 then a 4 so perhaps Ive gotten used to the more substantial size Its a really nice phone with great features Great camera too but the layout of the favorites for phone calls is AWFUL The Note 3  4 were better

And its so thin that Im always trying to get a good grip on it so I dont drop itand as a result accidentally starring all of my email as important as the starring is on the right edge of the phone where my fingers are when holding the phone in my left hand You cant put a protective case on it if you want to use the edge features as well so with no case it just always feels like Im going to drop it

Cant wait to get back to my Note 7 when they resolve the battery issuethat was the best phone Id ever ownedand Ive owned a lot of cell phones Battery life is very good Performance is good Display is good and worth it I owned a Note 5 for one year and upgraded to the 7 when it came out I was interested in the waterproof and bigger battery features We all know the fate of the Note 7 I swapped for the Galaxy 7 Edge Heres my impression
a I had been toying with the idea of a smaller phone for years While I did use the S Pen the Note phones were on the larger side and Im a big guy I love the smaller phone but the screen is still very adequate Ive not even noticed the slight decrease in screen size 
b I wasnt sure if the S Pen was a feature that I needed or just a feature that I used because it was there One week into my 7 Edge and I dont miss the pen at all
c Samsung has amazing cameras My whole family has iPhones and they are constantly asking me to take the important photos The 7 Edge is no exception Truly spectacular photos
d The bigger battery is just fantastic Ive used my phone all day its 9PM and I still have 45 battery I would have plugged my Note 5 in by now for a recharge 
e I really like the always on display 

The quality of the image screen is just spectacular Samsung really has created some beautifuly displays 

Simply put in my opinion this is the best phone on the market right now I love this phone Samsung really seems like they listened and added a lot of features back that i loved on the s5 My only gripes with the design are 1 The screen is curved so there are very few tempered glass options 2 Would have liked the camera and touch pad to be made of gorilla glass because the camera cracked and the home button is very scratched 3 While touch wiz is lighter on this phone I still dont like seeing it and beijg forced to use some of samsungs apps Overall great phone PRO Awesome camera Long battery life MicroSD storage slot and waterresistant
CON No removable battery Its a wonderful phone with great features However it doesnt seem to have a great battery life Went from 100  700am to 12  630pm pretty good but thats a main reason I wanted a new phone better battery life and features This is a d great phone and easy to use nice feature set and colors Compared to iPhone or all else its untouchable in comparison The look and feel makes me want to pick it up more and include it in more of my daily activities Went from 5 to 7incredible difference in performance Perfect fit and sleek and modern design this is a very high recommended phone it is
amazing and very easy to use Smooth operation Good battery life Fantastic features Overall I would recommend this phone to a friend I am using the voice recognition right now and it is performing flawlessly Ive had the chance to use the camera a number of times and the pictures are excellent The color definition and Clarity of the photo is excellent and the overall quality of the photo is superb to my old camera The other thing that I notice is that the voice quality during phone calls is far superior to my old Galaxy 5 They have greatly improved what the caller sounds like and they have remarked that I sound better to them as well Overall this is a great phone The camera is fantastic accurate and fast Getting around the phone is fast enough thought not super fast What you read about the screen is true fantastic The only quibble I have is that the back of the phone is not as curved as the front so it feels odd to hold I almost feel like the screen curve would feel better as the back of the phone Its really a preference thing but I thought Id mention it I love the speed and reliability of the S7 Edge Performance meets expectations The camera is awesomeespecially because as a mom of two small toddlers capturing moments is the best Face timing option is a plus because my husband travels allot so being able to connect so easily makes it easier In love over all Great phone nice sleek design Interim phone till my note 7 comes back in Wish it had more memory and an s pen my only withdraw is it freezes opening up different Web pages Outside of the device being slippery when holding and the rounded edges this is a pretty dream device The Galaxy S7 is the sleekest fastest phone Ive ever had I have been very impressed with the camera and video that it takes and the quick edits that you can do Also with the speechtotext Ive been able to do this without typing for ever Samsung hardware has matured into a top of the line product Very stable and extensible This hardware paired with the Android OS makes an unbeatable combination I am coming from an S3 and I loved it I had an L 3 but intermittent WiFi and I had to drop back to my reliable s3 Love the new phone It is responsive It has a sleek design and I love the speed I have had a good experience with this phone so far This is a fantastic Phone One of the best android devices I have ever used Unfortunately theonly reason I have it is due to the Galaxy Note 7 recall making this a little bit less than the device is wanted Still great job Samsung Got this to replace S5 Active Bought with Gear S2 and Table English All work great together Phone is as advertised Upgraded camera is crisp and clear Phone sounds good as well This was an upgrade from the galaxy 4 that I had I made the choice because of the water resistant feature because I walk to work and because I use the fitness app Since getting it I have got the gear fit 2 and it is helping me to track my sleep and steps plus it gives me another way to track my steps Lovely phone great picture feels good to hold easy to use amazing camera Using as replacement temp for my Note7 May keep for my wife I tried multiple screen protectors but had a hard time finding one that fit with a case Overall I love the phone It offers a ton of great features that are useful for everyday task The phone does seem sluggish at times though ando this is the reason for 4 stars For a phone that is a step below the flag ship Note I would expect almost equal performance This is the only issue I see though most of the time it performs well Well I only have the S7 edge due to the Note 7 recall Overall compared to the Note 7 it feels flimsy As it has the same insides I suppose it is boils down to the extras that are lacking that has me indifferent about it Best phone I have owned yet  Glad I bought this for myself  Love it  I received this phone as an exchange for the Note 7 that was recalled Having used that phone first there are a few things that seem like could be added from the Note 7 For instance the notifications on the Always On Display only consist of missed calls and text messages Third Party apps like GMail or MLB At Bat are not shown This is not enough for me to not enjoy this phone though and is something that can be fixed with a software drop The phone is incredibly sleek though and so easy to use with many features which can sometimes be overwhelming but once mastered this phone can do it all The sound quality is incredible and with the new video call features it makes phone call with the kids fun So I didnt want the Galaxy S7 I wanted and had acquired the Note 7 which as we all know was recalled I begrudgingly took the S7 as a replacement Now having spent some time with it I see why they call it the best phone out there Its gorgeous durable welldesigned and fast It could use more internal memory and a cut in price I guess its the price you pay Samsung only keeps getting better and better this phone is my fourth galaxy series phone and I am extremely satisfied with everything about it The fact Samsung brought back sd card support only made it that much better Thank you Samsung keep up the awesome work as well as listening to customer needs Sleek design and processing speed Battery life seems less compared to S5 and S6 I cant say enough good about this phone Absolutely incredible display So many features I dont know where to begin Intuitive ease of use This phone does everything Easy to download my music through Google play I cant imagine how Samsung will improve on such perfection Technically this is my second Samsung galaxy the first one was a galaxy note 7 we all know what happened to those This galaxy 7 is just like the note just smaller would recommend this product to all my friends Id been using a Blackberry for the past decade and missed out on all of the features of the modern phones This was a great choice Before I had to return my note 7 and would rather have note 7 then s7 S7 is great but not as awesome as the note 7 Would like to get my note 7 back Enjoying the WiFi calling fast charging and text reply split screen features I like the phone and it does what it says I just wish I didnt have to hunt around to find out about the hidden setting etc Outstanding phone Snappy processor and great camera I have been a Samsung owner since cell phones first came out As per what I thought never ceases to impress me I will never be an iPhone user or any other brand Samsung Android for me for life i hate this phone i what my note 7 back thanks samsung Works as it should  beautiful display and fast to load up

Nice long battery life Just bought it and I am enjoying every minute so far looking forward to learn all its features I have has this phone for a shost time but wow It has great features and a wonderful design Fast operation and very appealing user interface Highly recommend Samsung Pay is killer 
Camera is outstanding and very very fast Pro features are top notch This phone is amazing in terms of looks design experience weight and overall feel make sure you setup your Samsung account and recovery options in case you forget your lock pattern like I did Painful recovery Forget about smart phones This is the worlds first SUPER phone Very easy to use battery last a long time and the speed is phenomenal No lag it can handle multiple applications running with ease It is everything that I hoped it would be and more I am definitely happy I chose the Galaxy s7 over an iphone Ive has it for less than a week Great so far I bought this a month ago and Im glad I did the battery lasts for a long time and its easy to use Love my new Samsung Edge phone Ithe is a great phone Nice design very good virtual qwerty very responsive intetface No data connection most times when off WiFi Verizon replaced SIM card and still does it  Samsung will have to replace it Coming from a previous model I miss the feature that allows the font size to be changed with the volume toggle and a few other minor changesoverall still favor the Galaxy to anything else I came from iPhone and have used Galaxy product too I absolutely love the product design the new camera is amazing my friends who use iPhone also notice the better picture quality The phone comes with 32GB storage and you can add memory if needed iPhone only has onboard capacity and cloud It has all the latest features apps play store and services anyone might need I very much prefer the s7 to the iPhone or any other comparable products out there Of all cell phones Ive had this is the best yet Of course its not perfect nothing is Its still hard to find certain settings I was ready to upgrade and wanted this Galaxy 7 I like the figure print lock setting and the sense for the health app this phone is fantastic I upgraded from the s5 after my charging port broke  The antenna seems to be less effective than the s5 fewer bars at my house and more dropped calls other than that great phone Really thought the battery life on the S7 would be better but it is not I switched from the S5 where at least I could change the battery when it got run down Had it for a week and barely making a full day without doing much on it Disappointed I had the s5 and the s7knocks it out of the ballpark Its camera features are so improved and the pro camera mode is amazing It is also much faster The only thing that was not user friendly which is not a major deal is that to add contact favorite to the home screen is not as simple Other than that I am totally happy with my new phone Traded S6 for S7 completely satisfied Nice phone Quick loading apps Seems to be the best phone out Great phone battery life runs out fast not but over all nice phone and features and easy to navigate Easy to use meets all my needs This phone is a great improvement over past iterations  fast reliable and waterproof This is definitely the best there is on the market Needed a new oneSo I got this one Ive only had the phone a week and I already live it Phone is awesome Love it more than the iPhone I had Upgraded to the 7 because my 4 was having good issues Getting good hot enough to burn my ear and shutting off of  its own Love the battery  life and speed of the 7 I came from an s5 and there few major changes Size is about the same Screen is a little better resolution but brightnesscolor is about the same The picture resolution is less but picture quality is much better especially in low light Front facing camera has better quality as well It runs games faster The new features are cool but not many Blood oxygen if you care about it The speaker volume and quality is the same but the call quality has improved Battery life seems better but not greatly seeing as I am comparing a 3 week old phone to a 2 year old phone So if youre looking for an amazing upgrade this isnt it Nothing to wow you but an overall solid phone I like the slightly smaller size and fewer preloaded apps This phone is awsome It has the best screen I have ever seen on a phone Love the colors and resolution also has good battery life and so many features I am in love I think this phone is totally awesome I like all the features and the clear picture The battery life is very good You dont have to worry about having to plug up charge the phone every time you turn around 
If you like the Galaxy Phones then this one will be the one for you Love the s7 first time going with android for everyday use and overall very happy Love the bit of freedom that comes along with the OS Got this S7 to replace an S 5 Active Really liked the Active but my carrier doesnt offer one The S7 preforms very well Only problem is the battery life Doesnt seem to be as good as the S 5 Active Im still learning my new phone However it has been very easy to do so  It also takes really good pictures I thought that with 2x the memory that the S7 would run faster than my 16GB S5 No WiFi at home seems much slower Streaming videos is impossible because of the frequent stops I am constantly getting a Youre not connected to the internet error when riding in a bus or a cab It New York City for goodness Sake Cant this stupid phone use the 4G network when I disconnect from WiFi Apparently not The protective glass cover I bought doesnt sit flat at the sides because the screen has a curve up on the sides The salesperson said this would flatten out After a week its no closers to being completely flat than it was when installed The buttons and screen are so sensitive that I am constantly taking screen captures of the home screen or some unwanted app every time I put the phone in my shirt pocket Nice screen image but a major disappointment I have had the phone a week  It was easy to get used to and I like the feature that shows you the text message while you are on the web and gives you the option to answer without ever leaving the webpage  I dont like the white pages for background on phone app  My s3 had lots of color Great phone good resolution on the display and easy to read even in bright light including sunlight Good camera quick focus and good color reproduction Good battery life Good call quality and decent signal The edge function is awkward and I would prefer the extra screen as flat instead of have the edge feature This phone has performed wonderfully and Ive been very happy with it I use it for organization and gaming and it does well on both

This size is nice being slightly smaller than my last phone which is nice because it fits in my pocket easier 

Easy to use and I like the apps that Samsung provides with or for the phone Upgraded to the s7 from s5 It is great looking and never have an issue with it Great display great memory and a long battery life Good phone runs great does get a little warm Good camera runs fast no major issues I would would let me people know to get a Samsung Just got this phone a week ago  Already comfortable with it Touch is a little of on the edges So far so good  great photos easy to use Great phone to have I love my new Samsung s7 edge I was an iPhone user and I switched to Samsung and I do not regret it Being able to connect my gear fit2 with my phone is an added bonus to all the wonderful features this phone has I can say there are times my phone is a little slow The camera is amazing and I love taking videos and pictures at a somewhat professional level I do have to say I really dislike how many apps were already on my phone that I cannot get rid of I belive they came with my carrier and they wont allow me to delete them even though I will never use them Outstanding phone by every means Excellent features camera and design I could not be happier I have many Samsung products and they are by far the best you can buy If you are in the market for a new phone the S7 should be at the top of your list Great phone and performance This is a very well made value packed phone Battery life is excellent The galaxy S7 rans very smoothly especially when ranning multiple applications at the same time It allows me to watch and play my games on there highest graphics setting This phone is a great multitasker Easy to use great battery life and easy to personalize Great Phone Love all the features and no Carrier bloatware Only issue i have is the FM radio feature is not activated would be great to listen to local FM stations from the phone but it is not a deal breaker Some Carriers have activated it through software but with it being an unlocked phone dont get the carriers software upgrades and that is OK by me As a regular note user this S7 is a great addition in a smaller package Although not all features are there its a great addition when size may matter Good product good service plan excellent coverage I love the quick charge feature I also love the water resistance quality Very good phone has everything I need in a phone and more Keep doing what you are doing great job This phone has so many great features I havent found all of them yetbut I find something new everyday I have a Note 7 though s7 edge was nice but I changed it for a Note 7 to be able to use more advanced features I like the phone but hate the adds that keep popping up on my home screen I have the pop up blockers on and they keep showing up Touchscreen isnt great but it does the job Very happy with the phone Everything about it is great I had an S5 and liked the functionality but it was getting old and messing up I went with the S7 because its familiar The updates are taking some getting used to I like it though Ive only had it a week and a half and have had numerous problems Getting  to hot to touch  at times screen going black restarting on its own  Took it to the store and got some adjustments made it stopped over heating but still goes blank sometimes  and restarts on its own I do lime the phone would would like one that works like it should I bought this phone April and in about 3 weeks into it I go to turn on screen and screen goes completely black I get my husband hp one to call mine and my phone rings and I can also hear message go through But my screen I still completely black I can return it cuz didnt have any insurance and couldnt afford a new one when I just for one I HATE this ohone Dont buy I just bought the Samsung S7 last week and half the time when I answer the phone I cant hear whoever is calling me and when I make calls they cant hear me or I cant hear them and theres a loud buzzing on the other end of the line Took it to Verizon and we switch the SIM card and that didnt fix it so now Im going to have to return it since Im still in my 14 day window to return I upgraded from a galaxy note 3I loved that phone now Im on to the S7 I lover even though its only been a few days I am still learning all the amazing features of this phone and loving it even more with every new feature Strongly recommend this phone to one and all I went from a galaxy s4 to a galaxy s7 edge and I have to say Im not disappointed whatsoever I got this phone as soon as it came out and I expected some bugs or things I wouldnt like but I have been I love everything about it One of my favorite features is the fingerprint scanner I love the fact that I can handle my phone whether in my pocket or hand and not have to worry about accidentally unlocking it or butt dialing anyone and I dont have to enter a password everytime Its handy when it comes to my niece getting a hold of it and not worring about her unlocking it AMD messing with it I also love that the speaker is now on the bottom and not the back I never have to worry about laying the phone down and not being able to hear and I dont have to hold it just to hear Samsung has outdone themselves with this awesome phone I love my phone It does almost everything my lap top cano do from signing documents for work legal tasks etc Battery life is amazing huge difference from the S6 The all over function and maneuvering of the phone is excellent The camera takes better pictures than any phone Ive purchased Im in love with my phone I purchased the gold again the phone is beautiful I havent come across anything negative in the past 2 weeks since purchasing my phone and believe me I would if I came across something In all no regrets VERY HAPPY customer I couldnt imagine owning another phone but a Samsung Keep up the good work Very disappointed that this up grade doesnt do what my S5 did  Talk to me This is the best cell phone Ive ever had I moved from a Note 4 and the screen is nearly as big brighter and the entire phone is much smaller and lighter Its simply the best phone on the market today bar none The only significant loss was the removable battery but the quick charge 20 portable batteries really make up for it I only wish it was cheaper Great phone still finding new features I dislike the fact that the standard music playing app is not available on the S7 That means you either are stuck downloading a free app with tons of advertisements or paying for an app that doesnt play as easy as the original did I love the Edge beautiful display awasome phone is the best phone i touch i like the crystal clear display and the excellent camera for pro use i really recomend 10000000000000  recomend I love this phone and my Gear S2 watch I put an extra battery on the phone and adjusted the settings and the battery life is great I bought it 2 weeks ago and is the best phone I ever own Great phone big bonus for water resistant so far great battery life we need a anyway install micro usb love not having that extra piece in the micro usb like my old phone Like having a phone jack like built in wireless charging and goodle duo face time for android

do not like the fact that my phone has had an issue with hanging up on all calls after about 5 seconds Verizon helped I think but works now
do not like not being able to change battery ok so far
do not like that my phone updated and forced me to reinstall everything as if it were a new phone once so far Has Excellent screen takes great pictures easily transferred all data from S4 to S7 Easy to set up Printed manual and was self explained Highly recommend A Went from a Galaxy 5 to a Galaxy 7
 Very happy with the phone and the performance Very easy to navigate Love the phone Not very durable housing The back of my phone cracked right away from using my Samsung VR Love the S7 This is the best phone Ive had yet just upgraded from the S5 and am very happy I have had all the Samsung Galaxy phones I always like to stay uptodate on the new phones that come out and they keep getting better and better Keep up the good work Samsung Its so much faster Love the new S7especially the improved camera
Im a Samsung fan for lifeso I love everything about my upgraded S7  It takes the best pictures for an Android device and I love its Sleek design and the color of my Samsung S7 is to die for I love the fingerprint scanner and I love this phone all together I really like the new features but they took away some of my features I always used  Just purchased the S7 2 weeks ago I love it This phone has an amazing camera good battery life and wonderful features The bio fingerprint lock makes it easy to access my phone as well as several other app logins I play silly games like Cookie Jam in my downtime and my battery still makes it through the day Ive had this phone about a week Im already very comfortable using it for my private business Very user friendly I use my phone for music when I teach yoga and to post pictures and videos to market my classes I also use it to take take payments through the square app Phone email google maps and banking are all seamless Im very happy with my new Galaxy S7 Im glad I have received this phone as a gift  They knew I would love it  Overall a very good phone Developed well Its fast which is what I want My only complaint is it seems a bit smaller than previous phones Otherwise I love it I absolutely love it the phone works fast Takes amazing pictures Not bulky Display is beautiful Beautifully styled and highly functional Screen quality is superb sound quality very clear not much bloatware installed Love the style and design I am Samsung all day
100 As a user of the iphone 3gc and each generation up to and including the 6 i found it a bit difficult to navigate at first essentially never using android
i was swayed by the comments of my son and also by the other samsung items i own dvd blue ray  tvall in one desk top touch screen computer etc
the in store representative gave me a nice run through on an individual class and though i still have a lot to learn im beginning to really like this phone Galaxy S7  the camera is AMAZING and the hd voice sounds like im standing right next to caller hats off Samsungyouve outdone yourselves again The Galaxy S7 Edge is without a doubt the best phone on the market Easy to use interactive great apps etc etc etc There is so much to like Ive had an iPhone and a Windows phone and will never go back Samsung rocks again Very happy with the phone Great phone Will never stray away from Samsung Durable phone with excellent specs Micro SD card up to 200gb 1

I guess well see Bought 2 weeks ago Was dreading learning a new phone but this phone So easy to use Easy to transfer  all my contacts and pictures Takes great pictures  very fast Its awesome Unequivocally the best phone on the market right now I liked the size of the S4 The heavy duty belt case is bigger than I like  But overall the phone works well  I  plan to get as used to it as can be expected for an 80 year old man Had for a week  So far most everything good  Thought battery life would be longer  Camera good I have not used all the features yet Great phone great features Love the video call feature wish I could call friends who uses other providers Great phone Very happy Great dealCostco Bought week ago and very disappointed  Seems I down graded instead of upgrade Less things on it unable to transfer my info I love this phone We completely inseperable I highly recommend it Getting this phone was the best thing I did Great device super powerful would recommend it works so well This phone is about as good as it gets Stylish Smooth operating Loaded with features and intuitive Happy Samsung owner Car Mode and SVoice come to mind  Downloaded Car Mode and it doesnt work as well as it did on S5  Maybe there are replacements that are better I havent looked yet and Ill probably have to dl and install vs S5 they just were  So far the S7 out performs the S5 but otherwise for the money spent I am not impressed This product has great features and is very easy to use So much smoother everything  Button responsiveness phone calls are clear  Apps dont hang freeze or go crazy in general  Battery lasts all day  Just feels good in my hand spiegen case tops it off perfectly  Perfect  There is nothing I havent liked yet The pictures are great and I have a lot more storage than my old iPhone Sweet phone the picture quality is awesome Love that its waterproof Ive had this phone for two weeks and its great Ive had my phone for a week now and I like it better than my S4 I got this phone about 3 or 4 months ago and every time there is an updated I loss my contacts and then I have to call Verizon to have them put them back on my phone the last update I said the forget it so I dont have all my contacts I should have just stayed with my s5 Its a great phone love it one of the best phones I have had  I set up the swipe lock for 4 different swipes to unlock my device first time using it I have to have my phone master reset not a feature I would recommend anyone using Bought this 2wks ago  so far not disappointed I believe the S7 can read my mind Having a blast using this phone as a learning tool Had my home phone line disconnected 3 days after receiving my first smart phone A little tech fear put to rest in a couple days Still finding cool functions every day If I can learn to use the S7 anyone can Love my phone Hate the battery life The only thing I dont like about it is the battery life Even though you have a quick charge cord And the battery can not be replaced once it goes the phone is donealso phone gets hot I  bought three phones in the three months I love this phone Before I had the Samsung S5 and I loved that phone too The camera upgrade is amazing 

I do miss the flashlight widget for the S7 and the new screen protectors have been a disappointment They do not fully seal to the phone Upgraded from an s4 clear crisp features awesome functionality Love the fast charging  feature I am incredibly happy with my purchase Its not all what they make it out to be  Since the beginning of August 2016 until now 82916 Ive had 3 phones  The first one blacked out  the home key didnt operate The second one the battery got real hot  the phone was blinking on  off Now the 3rd phone After taking a lot of pictures the home screen shut off  the Home key wouldnt operate Had to wait a couple of minute to come back on  needed to make a very important phone call  Not happy with this phone at all Always an iphone user decided to try something different and now I will never go back to iphone nice to joint this program i really love this product Love the features and long battery life Easy to buy and setup All the features it has to offer is what I wanted and more I couldnt ask for a better phone Ive only had this phone for 2 days and I love it The features are great and the pictures are awesome I would highly recommend this phone to everybody The camera on this is out of this world and top notchan it is durable and stylish and has a sleek and smooth case This is a great smart phone Very good value I love it Ive only had it a week So far I love it Very fast amazing phone Great camera and long battery life It is a decent phone Upgraded from the S5 and Im extremely happy with the enlarged memory and updated camera The phone operation is very similar to the S5 so it made for a quick learning curve Does everything I need Fast Efficient Sleek I was bouncing back and forth between the LG and my Samsung S7  No regrets going with the S7 Love my galaxy s7 Had an iPhone 6 and was so worried about switching phones but I am so happy we did I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge What a great fone I have this in the GOLD and it gets a gold medal for looks performance and quality Support from Samsung has been super My husband had an iphone and switched to an S7 edge after seeing how well my previous phonethe S4 and now my S7 works He loves the size and the sleek display I havent had this a whole week yet but so far I love it THIS IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD I DONT HAVE ONE CRITICAL THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS PHONE IT DOES EVERYTHING AND THEN MORE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE It was a great phone for my husband who isnt phone savvy Only had for a week but I love it  Screen is bright and clear size is fantastic I had an S4 before this Love the features and ease of use Cant see myself with another phone I only had it for a few days and I loved it Just brought it on yesterday love love love it The first thing I noticed is how clean the screen is That is to say the Optics on this device are outstanding I noticed no degradation when I went to the camera Battery life is great I can usually get 3 days out of the battery even if I play a couple of video intensive games I only gave it 4 stars on design because of the following reasons I have a new Plantronics Bluetooth headset and the system doesnt recognize it However I have an older Logitech Bluetooth headset that works just fine The only other complaint is that my fingers are little beefy and sometimes when Im holding the phone they kind of reach over and touch the screen I think both are minor problems I bought a homido VR goggles and the S7 Works flawlessly with it This is a very powerful unit and its reasonably priced Great job Samsung Was easy to set up and easy to use  Much easier to learn than the Note4  Battery last longer Feels cheaply made
Not as easy to delete batch emails on AOL as the S5
Choice of sounds are disappointingredients I miss the whistle Highly recommend the Samsung s7 I have only had this phone for a week but it is suited to meet my needs Had this phone for a couple days now and it has been great to me Love the features Dont get me started on the camera quality Oh my never seen life so clearer through a lense before I received this product Sucks Dumb Stupid I love the phone  I like the battery life its awesome I wonder how long it will stay that way I like the speed of it to I am confused about why the S7 from Verizon wont play fm am radio with an app when it will for the other carriers This means I have to stream music and news or carry a separate radio to listen to the local stuff Im not sure if this is by design or an oversight I hope that they can fix this I was desperate to get out of the S4 after 2 years of horror Verizon replaced the fone 4 times trying to make me happy but the fone was a piece of crud from day one There was no way to make it work after the second or third upgrade Terrible fone Why upgrade beyond the fones capabilities is still the question i have I find it easy to use and so far like it really well Got it this week and love it I was in need of a new phone and was a little unsure about if i wanted the Edge or just the S7 Im super glad that I purchased this phone instead  Not really had any issues with it  I live in a deadzone so theres not a lot of signal and there are some dropped calls  But that happens with everyones phone when they are at my place I have owned many  many Samsung products 15 total in fact The S7 Edge is by far my favorite to date It is the most responsive gadget filled and user friendly s series on the market The screen size is perfect and the updated edge software is heads and shoulders above the last iteration Thank you Samsung after having nothing but problems with the edge 4 three of them I had all but writhen you off but this phone has put my faith back in Samsung products My son had an old S3  so this was a nice upgrade for him  One less distraction now for high school  I have the S6 and see some some enhancements though not enough to convince me to jump yet 

I do like the return of the SD card and the water resistance features Size is good in hand  The screen is awesome as well as the camera 

Using a Spigen case extreme case with a tempered glass protector both from Amazon   

Overall great phone and cannot find any complaints at this point  Enjoy This is an awesome phone Do not enable the finger print security  It is not reliable and when it fails you lose all your information  I would not purchase this phone again 

Phone microphone works poorly I bough the this phone a week ago I love this phone I am very happy with my new phone I really am impressed with the camera I had a Galaxy I I Note which I kept for 3 years because I loved the ease of use and didnt  want to trade in But Im glad I did The phone is still great  easy to use the slightly smaller size is perfect but the camera makes this phone It takes such incredible pictures Very very happy with this phone Upgraded from older Samsung model  Learning experience  Something new every day  Sadly no owners manual included Its all trial and error Great phone overall  Hard to pick what I like the most out of the box I was immediately impressed  Ive seen numerous videos and read multiple reviews on the S7 and couldnt wait to get my hands on one  Now that I have I cant let it go  To put it simply you need to experience the phone first hand to understand the hypend and all it has to offer Love this phone it is packed with tons of features performance is over the top Love Love it I hadThem  for one week now no problem Its a all around good phone the camera takes good night pictures witch all Samsung products are good I will never switch to any other phone Bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and all the new features are wonderful  My Samsung S7 works effortlessly and so far its been amazing  The camera is exceptional The S7 has performed beautifully I would strongly recommend it Bought one week ago good phone Wish i would have known about the more sturdy verson Happy I bought this The charger piece the goes into the wall doesnt work though Ive only had the phone for a week but I like it so far No complaints I like the phone its different but Im getting use to it I cannot put it down Best phone ever it does everything I need it to do and then some It a good phone overall but the battery life isnt as good as my 2 year old HTC M8 Some better camera features the the M8 but still a pretty good phone overall I got this phone for my birthday and I was very impressed with the camera Also it has the Google App Store so you can get almost any app you would want A fantastic phone Very fast and smooth If youre an iPhone aficionado  I highly recommend you look at this phone before your next upgrade I almost forgot to mention that the camera is awesome too This is definitely the best Samsung I have owned yet and Ive had every one thats came out The camera takes the best pictures and the overall look and quality of the phone is exactly as described  Id highly recommend this phone to everyone Got a few days ago Kinda dont like how hot it gets but other than that I guess its oksy Still learning it Love thisphonevery easy to usegreat look I had a Galaxy S4 for 2 years and loved it and was worried about upgrading because my husband has an S5 and its terrible  I had no need to worry though  The S7 is amazing  Very fast and easy to use  They have made improvements over the prior phones  Only a couple of down sides 1 Back is glass which I did not know and got a crack in it the very first day Lesson  dont use a cheap case 2 They need to figure out how to make better glass add in screens that fit the whole screen without having the edges come unstuck 
3 You can not currently adjust screen sensitivity and this is really not cool How do you forget to add that as a feature
Im nit picking but trying to be honest Overall Im very pleased with my new phone and would recommend it Still trying to learn how to navigate on the new phone Couldnt ask for anything more than what the S7 provides in every aspect  detail Evolve forums iPhone in the past couple of decades this one breaks easier than any It seems to shatter very easily Didnt even have it a month before it cracked the first time I love my new S7 Edge have enjoyed using it although features that come with it still learning how to use it and all that it can do but enjoying the process keep up the good work Samsung looking forward to new products in the future The new Samsung Galaxy 7 is awesome It takes great pictures the sound quality is very good Also the apps are great and easily accessed Keep up the good work I traded in my Verizon Droid cellphone because I was having major problems with that phone because Verizon will only replace your phone with a refurbished phone  After several replacements and extreme frustration  I replaced the Droid Maxx for the Samsung Galaxy S7 The battery life is absolutely awful I had to purchase a mophie in order to keep the phone charged through the day My phone by lunch time is just about done My phone has spent more time on a charger or mophie then in use I only charge the phone during the day so it doesnt get over charged I also close out of my apps so I dont drain the battery and close out of any Internet sites that I access but unfortunately nothing works  Now Im stuck with this phone for the next two years I have made a mental note to never buy another Samsung phone Buyer beware do not buy this phone unless you buy a mophie so you can keep charging the phone and also if you dont mind a phone with a very tiny tiny battery Not a happy lady Very easy to use but seems to use a lot of data Nice phone Easy transition from the S5 Itseems fast and the Gear VR is awesome This is the 3rd galaxy I have owned Keep going back Camera features are great This phone is fun as well as efficient Easy to manage Great features this is a great phone have had no problems so far Its so much smoother in operation to my s5 and its got new features that are fun to use On the sixth day the phone screen  cracked Would not recommend this product to any real person who lives in the real world i love this phone somebody put a lot of thoughts on this phone this phone is highly recommend by me 3 weeks of trouble free operation This phone is the worse To many things to list that are wrong with it Hope I can return it Love it so farfast easy sign up at Fallon Walmart I was still in love with my S5 when this phone came out and I wasnt planning on upgrading But Im glad I did My fiance and I both upgraded to the S7 edge and we couldnt be happier Samsung has the best products out Bought this phone and switched to Verizon 2 weeks ago and could not be happier Samsung does it again the S7 is more than I could have ever expected How did I ever live without it You cant go wrong if you should choose this phone Also Verizon service is awesome as well I finally caved and bought a new phone I upgraded my S4 to an S7 and Im soooo happy that I did I only purchase Galaxy phones because they always seem to impress me Theyre easy to use and easy to learn I love my new Galaxy S7 and recommend it to anyone out there looking for a great phone I just bought my Samsung Galaxy S7 about a couple of weeks agoits even better than my S4 that I had for nearly 2 years Lighter phone and sleek look Camera has an amazing focus and great selfie camera Many new features for the camera I bought this 2 week ago and am extremely happy with it Very good phone I always liked android products I had the core prime which did similar things but the s7 has a lot more memory and better features I love the features and overall use of the phone I bought this recently  Love it This is a beautiful phone with great features I have a hard shell case for my phone and carry it in my pocket I am having a lot of trouble with applications being accidently launched that I never had with my Galaxy S4 The phone also initiates calls to random people in my contact list I recently went to Europe for three weeks and took the phone along for wifi use I did not have any phone service while there Nonetheless I incurred roaming charges for calls initiated without my knowledge Note 7 is excellent very light Iris scanner work very well Even in low light outdoors doesnt seem weird to use Works perfectly even with contacts on even wore sunglasses still unlocked phone no problems Coming from the note 4 this is a great improvement overall Your tech support is the best I have ever encountered I purchased the S7 a well ago after having to revert from an S4 to a Galaxy 1 Needless to say it feels great having a phone that can do so much I have had many different Android and Samsung phones but the best one yet is the Galaxy S7 Edge I love the water resitance and the fact that it doesnt even have a cover you always have to put back on the charging port I also really appreciate the sd card coming back and I have never had a phone with this big of a battery Definitely give this phone a try Got this phone a few weeks ago after having a Motorola Driod Turbo 2 that I had nothing but peobelms with  Samsung by far is the best Getting used to the change from my lg But we like our new phones so far Great phone easy to usr I havent had this phone very long acouple of weeksbut it is without a dought the best phone I ever had One problem the keyboard is not sensitive enough on the P and 0 Sometimes they wont take unless I am very deliberate with my selection Updated my phone and am glad I did I did my very first trade in and I will never ever regret it Ive had this phone for a week now and im definitely loving it only thing is sometimes the phone gets warm while its charging Got it 2 weeks ago still trying to figure out Been using this phone for almost a week  Love it way more than the S5 Cant wait to get another of these phones liking the features Bought this phone week ago taking it back tomorrow  People call and can not hear me Say I sound far away or cant hear me at all I bought this last week and I love it Its been easy to use Extremely happy with the upgrade Love the camera but thats it The phone lags and apps wont work Even with redownload information and clearing cache and cookies I upgraded to the Galaxy s7 from the 4 and I love it It has slightly different features that I like better I like the grouping of apps so I have more room for other apps I like the easy access to the camera and its options with video and where to share them My fiancé had a galaxy s3 mini and upgrade to the 7 and loves it I bought my galaxy s7 about a week ago and have fallen in love with it in the first day The phone itself is easy to hold and operate and never feel like your going to drop it Some of the features is it can do split screen take selfesteem using the heart sensor super fast processor bright screen awesome cameras on both front and back waterproof and comes with android pay I bought this just over a week ago I expected the battery to last a lot longer due to the specifications its lasting half the time on power saver mode and with location  Bluetooth turned off Swipe texting is not working as well as my old phone s4 mini  I have made a lot of errors maybe it will just take a while to guess the word in trying to spell I also think my old phone got better service at my house Im always having to repeat myself Maybe I  just got a lemon Lastly I am still trying to get used to the size of the phone I was very hesitant to buy the phone cause I really like the mini version  but with the s7 mini over 4 months late being released Im guessing it wont be PLEASE BRING BACK THE MINI Very happy with the phone but taking pictures needs improvement Usually outdoor pictures on a sunny day seem to turn out very well However indoor pictures can be hazy  difficult to discern detail I am happy this phone was recommended by the sales  person  I love it Awesome phone I had the galaxy s6 for 3 years  and I finally upgraded Had the s6 edge previously Just when I think samsung cant up the game  they do Hated my small phone This phone is not made for people who live a rugged life style The phone will break Do not buy it is too fragile Absolutely love the pictures this phone takes Just bought the Galaxy S7 this phone just works so far so good works great I love the wireless charging I bought this phone a week ago but I had problems since day 1 I hate not to been able to unlock the screen with the fingerprint And even though I had read my notifications they still on my home screen until I clear them off Have used Samsung for ever Love this phone A must have My kids thought I should get with the times so I bought this phone a little nervously but boy am I glad I did Its so much easier to use than my old phone and with the calendar and OK Google Im always on time and it keeps me on track with all my appointments I dont feel lost anymore It even gives me driving directions if I dont know where to go Love it fast great graphics cool features great camera Best phone out there I was looking at the Samsung Galaxy S7 Active however I was talked into the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I tried to like it get to know it use it and get used to it but Ive had it just a little over a month and I still dont like it have trouble using it because of the edges you put it in your pocket and you start opening pages on it that you have no clue how you got there or what you did I had the note 3 before but it just said you need to upgrade and shut down I was waiting for the note 7 but I had to get a new phone ASAP so I settled for one highly recommend and I HATE IT But now I have to wait for my next upgrade in 2 years Uuuggghhh Very good phone with a lot of features For once I am happy that my olde phone crapped out on me the s7 is wonderfully updated  Games play smoother loading pages takes less time and I must say putting the speaker on the bottom of the phone is a MUCH better idea than on the back the sound is much more clear
Im a bit disappointed that I cant create my own folders on the homescreen unless I can and just havent figured it out yet The biggest let down though is that all previous conversations on one of my chat apps Kakao have completely disappeared The different threads are there but the conversations arent
I also have to uninstall  a few apps Im probably not going to be using but other than all that this phone is fantastic  The reason Im giving 4 stars is because I think the battery could be a little better I received this phone as a gift and I love it Its user friendly and the look is so classy Phone freezes occasionally  A reboot unlocks it  You have to be very careful adding additional memorythe holder is made of very flimsy  cheap plastic  Fast charger is awesome  Overall very happy Easy transition from previous  phone The best galaxy phone yet nonNote phone This phones battery life is horrible Carry a charger with you all all times With minimal usage during the morning my phone is dead by afternoon after being charged all night Its OK  Settings are lacking a bit compared to s4 but maybe after getting used to it will become more comfortable This is such a great phone and the pictures are terrific The phone integrates well with other devices in my network I recently upgraded and Im glad I did Thats all I had to say about that  Nice phone Better than my blackberry I didnt know it was running many applications and it ate up all my data The Verizon salesman should have said something Also when I renewed my contract my leftover data should have been added to the new plan Bought this phone about three months ago and I can say that I LOVE it  The Snapdragon 820 processor is amazingly quick  Camera is by far the best out of the box If you decide to learn more about the camera options you can fine tune the phone to match a professional camera  A 3000 mAh battery is incredible  Im a moderate to heavy user of the phone and I can say that it does me well for a daily driver  Generally Im left with about 35 at the end of the day at 10 PM The water proofing is also amazing  Ive submerged it in a glass of water for about 25ish minutes and it works just fine  There have been occasions where Ive even taken it to a pool to shoot some video and pictures and nothing bad happened  Just make sure you dont leave it in the pool for more than 30 minutes just for safe keeping  The body is extremely easy to hold and all buttons are easily accessible Some extra perks are the fingerprint scanner super high resolution screen and the wireless charging capabilities So far I LOVE this phone and this is after six years of iPhone usage  Best phone on the market and Ill recommend this phone to ANYONE  Good job Samsung  I recently replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 with the Galaxy S7 since my phone was eligible for an upgrade I was excited to transition over to the S7 since Ive heard so many good things about it 

The first thing I noticed was that the audio for both media and calls sound a bit off compared to the S5 Not much I can say about it You have the option to optimize the audio to your liking Even after some tinkering I really didnt think it made that much of a difference 

Another big thing I noticed was the battery life Ive had to charge my phone about three to five times in one day Plus it takes a very long time to charge even after claiming that its supposed to charge relatively quickly I started charging my phone at 47 and an hour later its only at 52 I feel like my S5 charged faster and lasted longer 

On the bright side the picture and video quality is awesome But for someone that streams a lot of videos on Twitch YouTube Netflix and Hulu I rely on longlasting battery life and good audio Again not too impressed Love how fast it is Love the android applications Love all the new updates from my old Galaxy s5 I went from the Note 5 to Galaxy 7 much easier to handle Loved my Samsung S4  although it is much the same  its faster with a better camera I miss some of the menu controls from the S4 but am learning how to navigate with the S7 Extremely sorry I made this purchase  Stuck with a Lemon Great  phone ease of use Fantastic phone with a lot of great features Switched from the iphone 6 and I am happy with my choice I had to exchange my first S7 because of screen defects Since I have exchanged for a new S7 I love it Great design and the battery life is good I love my new Samsung 7  I love the look and functionality  It is Samsung and a whole other level Battery lasts forever I can use it in the elevator without any connection issues or breaks  Best of all  it actually does work underwater  I climbed Dunnes River Falls with it in Jamaica and took photos the whole way with it  All the iPhone people had their phones in baggies and mine was in my hand Great photos and no usage issues  Best phone ever I got my new Galaxy S7 about 2 weeks ago and I have to say it is wonderful  The camera is fabulous I think it may be better than my little digital camera love everything about my new Galaxy S7 same great features camera is better interface is cleaner but the battery is awful i have to charge halfway through my day if i want it to last to the evening and that is with minimal usage hopefully this gets fixed with the next software update I bought this about two weeks ago and Im so glad I did Its s huge step up from my Galaxy S 5 and worth every penny The phone is so fast the graphics and the screen are so clear and sharp Im in love with it Love it My dream phone Upgrade due to broke my 4s Only complaint so far is that it wants to update software daily Get aggravating popups constantly Cant seem to make it go away Had this phine for like 2 weeks Not impressed  Battery is the same as my s6 the only upgrade is the camera  I should of held out for the the s7 note Lesson learned I Upgraded to this phone a couple of weeks ago and I am really enjoying getting used to it The processor is much faster and I like all the new features I wasnt very keen about changing to another phone but Im glad I did as this has been a pleasant experience I am happy I got this s7 it awesome Its not very different from the G5 but the battery is much better
Only problem the autocorrect is way too sensitive Now its including every email address in my contacts Hate that I just upgraded from s4 and so glad I waited Great performance Fast Battery lasts 2 12 days Nice features Nice feel Great photos Samsung has done it again I love this phone It is simple to navigate I like the phone and features Great phone  slick Great device would recommend to anyone Very glad I have it easy to find things so simple thank you Bought this S7 a couple of weeks agoI love itstill have lotsto learn I came to Samsung from iPhone and cannot wait to go back to an iPhone  I did not find this an easy transition usage feels clumsy to me  I had to change settings in 2 places to get them to work  The camera quality is great  Call quality is not  Constantly dropping calls even if I am standing in one place not moving Its complicated to use  I think I should have went with Apple phone as everyone says its easier to use  No quick access commands I bought the phone a week ago It has been absolutely fabulous Easy to use love the themes And runs Pokémon Go flawlessly Nice package I bought in to the numbers they publish and thought it would be a nice upgrade My last two HTC phones have been really good Dependable Fast Reliable Samsung is glitchy Freezes Must repeatedly attempt to down pages Loses GPS even when stationary Went online and they have pages devoted to trying to make it work like a normal phone Bad sign I should have got the HTC M9 Also it likes to force your email messaging and voice mail on to confusing proprietary apps
Next time its back to HTC unless an update comes along that makes it work like it should I was forced to purchase a new phone after I dropped my LG phone  broke it When I visited the Verizon store the rep told me about the Samsung Once he showed me all the features I had no problems in changing Very easy to navigate From reading all the reviews about the battery life I decided to upgrade I am so disappointed Unless you have this on power saving it does not last at all And the worst part having it on power saving you loose a lot of functions I couldnt figure out why for a few days my emails were not coming through and it was because of the power save This sits on my desk and I may check email or Facebook but it goes from 100 to 60 before lunch and Im not spending alot of time on it I have to keep my portable charger with me if Im going to be out for the day Not worth the money Maybe I got a bum phone Verizon I love my Samsungs but dont like this one I got the s7 and love it  We have had Samsung before so they are great cells I love the camera quality because I take lots of pictures  Love the screen size I havent found anything I dont like about the phone More memory faster awesome camera  Got the phone a week ago Love all the new features Still learning but its really easy Bought this a week ago I upgraded to the S7 for only 1 reason Gear VR Im a game developer and I wanted a device to side load my apks The phone is great reception great performance is amazing display is unreal battery life is great for stock You cant upgrade or access the battery so I count that against this model Also when running VR apps or high resolution games the S7 gets hot and not a little hot it freaking bakes and starts to throttle the cores to reduce the heat which results in laggy and nausea I kill everything except my VR apps and it still is scorching Since Verizon cant fix this I suggest you use the Gear VR or Cardboard in front of your AC or a strong fan until Winter P I have had this phone for a week Battery life is amazing and charging time is fast Crystal clear pictures and overall speed of the phone is so much better than the S5 Adequate phone  Too expensive  Not as easy to use Have had for one week and learning fast Switch to yall a lil over a week ago love it I didnt think the camera could be better than the one on the S4 but its much clearer and brighter than the S4  Very impressive I bought my Galaxy S7 about two 2 weeks ago and am still learning how to use  This was a drastic update from a very old Galaxy so lots of new bells and whistles which I am not familiar with  Wish it can with a users guide Very happySamsung rocks I loved it untell I heard about the s7 active I wish verizon had it The battery isnt as good as advertised Also you cant set different sounds for email and text  messages All in all not a bad phone but it could use a some tweaking I bought this phone because I had to charge the battery  for my S5 during the day  The S7is not any bettet I like my phone Theres a few things I havent figured out yet When phones are just a phone you dont know how to use all the extras Ive had it for a week  love the features offered I upgraded from an S4 and the S7 is much faster and just as easy to use After I got my Samsung7 I recommend to my friends Its a nice phonekind of sorry i gave up my Iphone So glad I got the S7 Easy to use and lots of great features Not quite as easy to catch on to new features as I thought Have had the phone for 10 days still getting used to it Were retired and travel a lot and use the phone from phone calls Internet maps music pictures and so much more I bought this phone a few weeks ago and like it my only frustration is in trying to unlock it using my fingerprint the phone only randomly recognizes it after several days of using the phone My wife and I upgraded to this phone from flip phones The clarity and brightness of the screen is outstanding The new functionality for us anyway that we are using is great Using the functionality id not intuitive though Just downloaded the User Guide to sync the phone with a vehicles Bluetooth Not real clear but I figured it out The issues have been due to the learning curve that we have to go through and less than optimal instructions Great phone though As stated above Great phones Its a way better phone then my previous phone the battery life is way better Very happy we upgraded early Bought the phone 8 days ago and I would do one thing different and that is buy from a Verizon store not Sams Club Like it a great deal Of course it would be nice to have the battery last longer but thats okay Only difficulty Ive noticed is the Otter case is a bit too close so when I touch 0 it sometimes doesnt work I traded my S5 for this S7 and really love it The screen is the same size but it is much faster then the S5 Ive had this model just over a week and I am definitely missing my galaxy S4 that I previously had The S7 already has cracks all over the back side and the battery seems to run through way faster than my old phone I was expecting a definite upgrade feel from my last phone and I must say I just dont get that with this model Even the camera isnt as impressive as I was expecting which is a major feature that I use Hopefully I can make it through the next 3 years with this thing I bought this 2 weeks ago Better than Iphone by far Upgraded from the S6 as I was had many issues Battery life much better Very happy It is really great Little heavy for size of the phone Had to trade my s7 in because it kept freezing on Love Galaxy anyway and now LOVE the upgrades Water resistance is very nice Ability to move some apps over without having to try and find them all over again is sweet I bought the phone on 73016 only because I lost my S 5  Because of this my former data couldnt be downloaded to my new phone The S 7 is a nice phone and takes good pictures very happy with phone The Galaxy S7 is an excellent product Very easy to learn and operate Great phone with lots of improvements over the S5 Im transitioning from the S4 Im finding that the transfer process wasnt as seamless as the last time There are a lot of kinks to work through but overall a solid phone I might have preferred the bigger screen of the note but this is very similar in size to the phone that I had Functionality to be determined and user error almost certainly a factor  One of the best cell Ive own glad to be back to Samsung Like the galaxy 7 well Transition was good No problem with this new phone Love it Verizon customer for life Have been using for 2 weeks and operates smoothly So far the S7 is a very great and reliable phone I have one question   I have email through our account at verizonnet and with this new phone I have 2013 emails that I cant delete  I delete them and they come back both on phone and tablet Since the phone was purchased it has used data at an alarming rate Cant figure out how to make it stop Havent had this problem before now Just a few weeks since the upgrade  So far so good Still need to get familiar with all the new features but will get there and I know I will not be disappointed I am happy I switched over The switch was very smooth I love service So simple easy transition Had this phone for a week I bought one for myself and my mother full retail price  tax Im inlove with this phone My mom is super duper pooper scooper picky and she loves it also So glad we got this one verses  being the edge I love the picture quality and cant wait to take my California trip and capture epic photos with this bad boy Verizon customer since 2004 approved It has the most storage and is so easy to navigate Misses some of the previous features but like the new ones Especially love the new cameras and quality photos I an still learning to use this phone I love it its the best I moved from a Samsung Galaxy S3 to the S7 and what a huge difference The S7 has great battery life and is fast Glad I got this phone My wife went from an iPhone 5c to  the Samsung S7 and she is glad she did Had it a short time absolutely love the speed the features ease if useeverything I go it about a week ago I love the phone and features but I have had issues where I dont have service I cant get online or my texts fail to send  I never had any issues with my s5 I love my new phone  Has wonderful features   easy to use etc  The transition was amazingly easy Bought spur of the moment phone died out of nowhere I love taking photos of my dogs So I enjoy the quick camera shots feature Ive been capturing every moment not missing a step AWESOME Nice phone and the camera is ok but the battery life is awful I sometimes have to recharge 2x in one day and thats with minimal usage Keep Screen Turned Off feature doesnt work Wish I could alphabetically organize my home screen apps without having to touch and drag them  I would recommend to a friend but with reservations So much features and easy to  use Have had the phone for about a monthandahalf  have no complaints Its easy to use  Im still in the learning process on some of the things this phone can do This phone is great much better then my old LG I had a S6 Galaxy and loved it had IPhone for short period of time and was hard to adjust to but I actually think I like it better and want the iPhone back I love the clarity and quality of the phone It looks great and seems fairly durable I dont like the size too small and the touchscreen seems to not be very sensitive which can make it difficult to use at times Just bought my Samsung S7 and I love it Great Phone I love it Doesnt have enough options to change your home screen Miss the LGs 4th screen Dont like that notifications have to be attended to before you can get to home screen Great phone Should come with cordless recharging stand It really was pretty easy but my contacts and SMS didnt get restored properly Neither did my call history I love it the phone I am glad that I got this phone easy transfer of everything simple to use and the Verizon rep was very helpful Ive had my beautiful new phone for 2 weeks Its fully operational already My last phone was a year old and I was still having to call and ask questions on how to use it I upgraded from the Samsung S4 I was going to upgrade sooner and I really like the Samsung phones but I didnt like that they changed the charging cord on the S5  and I didnt like that they didnt have the slot for the SD card in the S6 Im glad that I waited for the S7 Its similar enough to the S4 that it has been a very easy transition and it has all the features that I like So far I love this phone I brought this a week ago and Im  getting  used  to  it I am happy with this device and features Had the phone for a week so far meets expectations  Photos are awesome I bought this a couple of weeks ago and glad I did The camera takes better pictures and adjusting the zoom is easier The screen is clearer I like how when you charge it it tells you how long it will take till its fully charged Battery lasts longer I also dont have to worry about the rain when I ride my motorcycle with my phone I needed a new phone and Im so glad I got this one After reading reviews and talking with a fantastic sales associate I made the decision to go with the S7 The camera the battery life the screen resolution are all as great as promised It is quick and I love the splitscreen function Love this phone smokes the iphone I am so happy to have a galaxy phone again they are the best The galaxy s7 is an awesome phone Great phone overall Ive had this phone for a couple of months and so far I like everything about the phone except for the fact that it draws all the info from internal storage only  and is not capable of directly reading from the SD card  where most of my files pics and music are stored In order for the phone to read the files and pics that I want it to read I have to make copies of all of the said files and pics and paste them into the internal memory just using up extra storage space which is stupid 
I also miss the upper and lower speaker strips my HTC had This phone only has a small set of speaker holes at the bottom of the phone just got mine about a week ago and not at all happy with the battery life or its overall performance The phone is OK  All these phones and plans are overpriced the car bluetooth will not work if i have my gear2 watch connected replaced a Motorola Razor Maxx with a Samsung Galaxy 7  The difference in battery life is unbelievable  The Samsung is terrible  Motorola would last 23 days Samsung wont get through 1 day Nice phone terrible battery The camera is crystal clear everything else is fine Love it Should have got it sooner I recently made the switch to Verizon and upgraded from the Galaxy S6 Edge to the Galaxy S7 and Im amazed at how much faster this phone is than its predecessor The features are the same for the most part so the transition was smooth but I enjoy the extra battery life the expandable memory and the wireless fast charging The water resistance makes stressing about getting it wet a thing of the past I love this phone Got this phone about a week and a half ago and very happy Had an LG G3 and tired of it overheating Have yet to even have that problem with this phone Such an improvement Downloaded more apps that I would have had issues downloading on last phone Love my S7 switched to S5 Beautiful screen 

Love the size

Very disappointed in the Marshmallow OS The picture editing software is a downgrade from Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS The builtin equalizer lacks options again compared to the Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS
Display settings offer more great options but took away some other useful settings 

Bottom line Im paying for a higher definition screen with less options than the Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS Had to exchange first phone due to mic issue  So far so good I like my new phone but still learning how to use it  I havent really had to time to investigate much yet I love the Galaxy 7 Great phone  Camera works great Takes great pics Fast processor Oh and you can make phone calls with it Lol the 2 s7 i have on my lines are both cracked already junk Third samsung phone and really like these phones Very easy to move your contacts pictures apps and items from one phone to the next Love all the features and the size Excellent picture quality Samsung is a quality brand I bought the phone a couple weeks ago first thing I noticed was ability to view in direct sunlight its amazingly clear outside the only drawback I found is the calculator I dont like the redesign it wasnt broke dont fix it everything else is fantastic Easy transition from my old phone Camera is great Battery life ok  It seems to have trouble connecting to wifi when Im out and about Replaced and S5 glad I did 2 weeks in and overall i love it fast and great phone Just getting used to change to samsung from motorola Bigger than my old phone but same aps and great camera Easy to use great battery life Only had this phone about a week I had to get a new phone as I ran mine over An Im hard on phones as I work outside an always using it     Had the Motorola Droid turbo an had been looking at either the new Motorola Droid or going back to HTC but everyone kept telling me how great Samsung Galaxy phone was  I told the sales guy I wanted to go with the HTC since the Motorola doesnt have ability to put an SD card in    But then I found out the HTC has the new style charging port which sucks as I have a car charger in every truck an tractor which is probably close to 1520 new chargers Id have to buy to not have to remember a charger everywhere I go  So I decided to go with the galaxy S7 since it has micro USB charger   Well I hate it    The battery life sucks    Fully charged at 8 am an dead by noon 2pm at the latest  My old turbo would atleast make it till 56 pm on average     2 there no speed dialing   You have to click the green call symbol everytime you call someone     3 phone will turn ringer to silent on its own  Which must be a Samsung thing as my brotherinlaws does it do   4 if your in your text messages an dont click back when your done an just leave a text open it wont notify of any new messages until you click back to main screen of texts   5 apps you habe downloaded dont stay in ABC order must click ABC every time you open your app page    Now for the pros camera takes good pictures an someone finally put a flash for the back camera    An there is a lot of choices for accessories as everyone makes something for a Samsung Im happy with my new phone it has better quality in use its easy to work with Ive had a Galaxy since the original one was released and only skipping the Galaxy 2  One of the things I have never liked TouchWiz  They have consistently released a very poor GUI  

The S7 is snappy compared to previous iterations while adding a lot more visual appeal Ive typically started off by loading a new launcher to my phone immediately so it was a surprise to see how nice the S7 was with just a few ascetic features such as changing the grid size and themes 

The optionssettings menu is much better organized and easier to use  as well from previous releases  But Im disappointed that a few things like counting steps seems to be missing from the always on screen or lock screen 

Its also too bad that they dont upgrade TouchWiz to new versions on older phones I typically upgrade for power so it really wouldnt change my buying habits or frequency

As for the physical aspect its beautiful and the first Galaxy that really feels like a  premium phone for price tag  I would rather be able to swap batteries as I have in the past but the 3000mAh battery is a nice and the battery life over all seems solid as does the charging speed

The game launcher and game tools are also seem like a nice touch that I havent had the chance to play with as much as Id like 

Overall it meets most of my expectations  I want to have more time with the camera but so far it looks fantastic 

The other thing outside of TouchWiz that Samsung seems to always mess up is major updates and causing battery drain but well see how it handles the first big update  My S5 was a nightmare heres to hoping they get this right as well Im so glad the battery lasts the camera is great I would recommend the phone with a few reservations  The phone reception is not as good as my HTC M8 and the battery does not make it through the day on normal usage  I only text use the phone and check email  I heard good things about the battery life but do not agree  I have to say that Im disappointed so far  Its only been a week but I expect the battery life will only get worse as I use it more Love everything about it Its waterproof too Just bought about a week ago Ok unit  easy to use Love the phone Feel is great I switched from a iPhone so I am still getting use to it but it is a nice phone Great camera I had the s5 for the last 2 years so the switch to the s7 was very easy  I bought my mom the same phone at the same time She previously had the s4 mini  Mom is having a lot of fun with the s7 This phone rocks  It is great A little bigger and heavier than my previous phone It works great It has lot of memory Awesome for watching stuff on it I like that it has kids mode After I organized everything my way I love it Too many ways to do the same thing Lacks some of the features I would use all the time or at least I havent figured out how or where to find them  I miss my iphone Traded S5 for S7  Easily made the transfer of data and apps We live Rural and the amount of dropped calls has tripled  Only had a short time but seems to work well Just need to figure a  way to retrieve everything on the old phone that exploded My first smartphone really  like it Im a simpleton but I have to admit that this phone is an Excellent choice  Im not one to change phones often but this Samsung S7 is a smash  Excellent features and easy to use  Get yourself a case for it  It makes it better to handle and hold  Besides youd want to protect your phone anyways  The operating system is fast to I upgraded from Galaxy S4 a couple of weeks ago With the S4 I had great service and mobile reception With the S7 all I have is dropped calls and no bars most of the time The local techs put a new sim card in  it has made no difference the phone is a good product  fast effective  Still has the problem that caused me to a new phone battery strength insufficient to last the full day  Even when powered off the battery continues to lose charge When sending text message or choosing to respond to a FaceBook post when I type my message and hit send it doesnt sentI have to do it over and over to send it  I was told I should disable draw over or overlay for all appsI did that but now wondering if there is something that I need that feature for i like that the battery stays charged more than 4 hours Ive been with apple ever sense they came out  just recently switched to android and Im so glad I did I absolutely love my s7 Battery lasts forever Fast Reliable Easy transition I love this phone and very satisfied that i switched to verizon Great but could use a bigger screen So happy to upgrade from my phone exchange to one that is so much easier to use I still had my S4 and it would drop mobile service This one has much better connectivity inside my house which is a BIG deal Everyone has trouble with connectivity inside this condo The pictures are amazing and the special effects like pan slow mo and more are just fun Storage will not be an issue here either
The sound quality has been within normal limits On a trip where I was using it for navigating from winery to winery and taking tons of pictures It did get low battery by 67p after unplugging around 8a On regular days though I still have 50 or better Its in my UAG case so it will not get injured and I have already dropped it a couple of times Best phone aND service Ive had in a while Switched from iPhone6 and while I really like the camera and many more of the features Im very disappointed with the reception I experience dropped calls and poor reception in the exact same areas where I never had them in the past Good storage space Quick operating system  It continually updates which is sometimes difficult Im sure its just being new Love the phone and its capability I would recommend this phone It is everything and more Love it works great for what I need I love it it is east to use Way more features than I will ever use but I am old and not tech savvy I have not found it too difficult to navigateLonger battery life than I Phone Chose it for the camera and am not disappointed Love it Had the phone two weeks now no issues so far I brought this like 2 weeks ago wow amazing Love the new Camera and video features  Great upgrade from the S5 I has happy to up grade to this S7 Id had my phone over 3 years and I needed to update I was worried that it would be too advanced for me but it has been made very easy to figure out the new features I absolutely love the new phone Its a phone have to have one Bought it because my s5 was screwed up Nice Samsung  Good touch sensitivity  Lags on media and gameplay After have the galaxy s4 and s6 I can say the galaxy S series just keeps getting better and better Samsung has thought of it all  I love all of the new features and I really like the fact that my phone didnt  come preloaded with garbage programs So glad I got this phone love it I believe the battery is the problem but they didnt send one Just bought it a week ago and still learning I bought this phone a week ago and its really hard to figure out and has just become a hassle Bought a few weeks ago and still finding more cool stuff I have had my new phone for almost 2 weeks and while I like the size and some of the features I am not as happy with it as I should be  Some of the features I expected are not on it and some of the ringtones and alert tones are not what they advertise   I wish I had the option to change to a different phone but I fear I am stuck with this one Love the new phone but the apps to transfer and upload all previous data still didnt work right  Cant upload to cloud for some reason  Phone to phone transfer didnt work either  Dont know whyjust irritating I have only had this phone for a couple of weeks and so far very happy with it I am glad I bought it I just bought the phone a few days ago and it is so fast easy to use and overall a wonderful phone  I upgraded and I am super happy with it Somewhat happy I love my phone  but not happy with reception This phone is super easy to use coming from any other Android specifically Samsung device However this phone gets HOT and quick If I need to use the GPS in my car I have to rig it to stick out of the air vents to stay cool or it will be almost too hot to touch
It also gets very hot just playing a game at times
The battery life is just fine This is a computer in your hand so its going to run down However this is the FASTEST charging phone Ive had Ive had this almost 6 months and Im very happy other than the temperature Its unbearable at times My first smart phone still getting familiar  Love the look and user friendly screen Thought it was about time I got a new phoneI love this new phone works faster and charges a lot faster than my old Galaxy 4 I bought it 2 weeks ago no complaints so far but the screen protector I am still paying for isnt the best I did not get my moneys worth screen is all scratched up already n protectors about to fall off disappointed in the protector Nothing really new from my old phone except for more memory which is a good thing Best switch ever very happy i bought this phone a week ago and its very easy to use Samsung just keeps making them better and better I really like the phone but miss the email air view air gesture  other personalization features Bought this about 2 weeks ago and love it so far This is a awesome Phone not to small not to big not to techy just right for what I need But as always first year or so battery is good but after that they go bad so we shall see But right now great phone I bought this phone as I needed to upgrade I am glad I upgraded Old phone wasnt holding charge  Needed to upgrade I bought two phones 10 days ago and theyre our first smart phones We have had to find our own way with the simplest of things and would really appreciate a printed users manual in the form of a small but comprehensive professionally printed book You cheaped out with the minimally useful quick start guide that came with them I found the complete manual online but cannot print it out due to time size and cost constraints with regard to paper and toner Very disappointing in that my husband and I have both been contacted by text message from a SamsungBestBuy service rep They inquired if we were happy with our phones and our experience I inquired about a manual Although their original message indicated that we would be contacted within the next business day Ive yet to receive any response at all You must be really concerned about our satisfaction with these phones Not I cant accurately respond to the following opinions because I dont know how many of the features work Ive had my phone for about a week I love it but the battery life is not long enough Its been easy to learn for someone not computer savvy Transition has been enjoyable and not so scary I like the phone Would recommend I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I love it We had 3 Galaxy s4s and just upgraded to s7s Could not be happier with the phones or Verizon service Win Had it for a week and loving it I previously had a S5 and the forced upgrade of android 6 turned it into a dog  I really like that the S7 is slightly narrower as it fits better in the hand  I was concerned that the case would be too slippery but it sticks surprisingly well in the hand  In general the device is fast with acceptable battery life to get me through the day I would recommend this phone Great quality and easy to use I bought it a week ago and love it The driving mode is great Battery life is awesome Just got this a couple of weeks ago and really like the way it looks and feels Has super camera and astounding memory capability Ive had it now for over a week so far perfect Great phone so fa  Last g5 was good phone I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 It has many of the same features as the S5 but much improved and easier to work with The camera is amazingly clear and captures movements without the blur The picture of the screen is crystal clear and vibrant Overally I love the phone I have had Galaxies for 6 years now and do not plan on switching Nicephone all around I have had a lot of dropped calls and data network unavailable errors during the first week Also many people tell me that my voice sounds tinny or metallic on calls Works fast and has excellent battery life I like that this is lighter weight than my old phone Still learning all the stuff I didnt want to give up my S4 but I was having problems with the WIFI even after to doing a factory reset I reluctantly went with the S7  I love it  All the things I loved about the S4 are very similar on the S7 The photos and the video are so much better  Very happy with the upgrade  Not having any of the battery problems I read about on the Internet Bought 2 phones Girlfriendso phone was stolen within a week the other girls admired it so much  Pleased with performance and security on mine I like how long it goes before it needs to be charged I wish I could put my Favorite Contactsong on my Home Screen as I could with my Mini Droid Very easy to use I really love my phone I was very happy with my S5 however the S7 is a great upgrade  Fast and simple to use right out of the box I bought this phone hoping it would be better but no its not I finally see a android system that works Very user well Love its features and simple to understand stuff Great for Samsung Smaller and more confusing overheats feels a lot less secure This is my 2nd S7 and both have had issues with freezing up on the time screen and running slowly with the camera  The gallery loads slowly and freezes although the camera does take good pictures So glad i purchased this galaxy S7 I have and the phone for about a week now It is easy to use but I have lost signal in my house It drops calls and is incapable of using the launcher I used to use While away from home the phone is fantastic Bought this phone the end of July to replace my HTC one  Pleased with my choice  Already recommended this phone to my sisterinlaw I love the Samsung S7  It was an easy transition from my old phone  Bright screen and great colors are nice  My only problem with this phone is that it doesnt hold my wifi  It will stay connected to my wifi for a bit and then it loses it and I dont get any notifications or anything until it finds the internet again  I was thinking it was my internet but my old phone had no problems and my Chromebook works great as well  Not sure what the problem is or how to fix it but overall a great phone  I also do not get 4G network when at home but I did with my old phone however the call quality is ok I bought this phone less than 2 weeks ago it is a good phone and it does charge fast the only thing I do not like is that the battery also dies fast I only have this phone for one week  have taken it back twice The group texting  sending attachments  with a text is not workingone more time  I  want a new phone Had the phone for just over a week Battery cant make it a full 12 hours My music was not backed up by Verizon Not really different than the S5 I had for 2 years No thanks at this time New phone is great
I didnt skip a beat I bought this phone a few weeks ago and I like it a lot A lot different than my s4 but not necessarily bad A lot of features that are helpful I like the Kids mode for my two little ones Its incredibly fast and it has great battery life Only complaint is that it seems to take a whIle to charge Easy transition Like waterproof feature Great phone pretty much the same as previous models with small tweaks Not a huge fan of going back to micro USB 20 instead of 30 and the micro SD card requires a tool to remove These 2 things make backing up photos a bit of a hassle Wireless charging is awesome though I highly recommend using the stand This phone does everything I want it to pretty much has it all Great  phone Love the shortcuts Great pictures Easy to use Got hot when I used the video camera for a long video but cooled down quick  Downfall takes a while to charge and cost  Luckily we are on the payment plan Good phone similiar to the Galaxy 5 but lighter and charges faster Its okay if dont like  the fact that it doesnt have the menu button but still its ok This is my 2nd galaxy series phone  Love the removable memory  the voicemail feature The improvements on other features really make this phone easier to use The  HD phone addition is so clear  Its like the person youre  talking to is right next to you  Theres none of that can you hear me now anymore I have never been more disappointed in a phone than I am with this one Dropped calls which have never been a problem doesnt stay charged but for a short time cant make calls from my residence which is the reason I switched to Verizon to begin with just overall very disappointed And have only had it a little over a week  will be a very long 2 years waiting on next updrade I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note but thought I would try the the Samsung Galaxy 7 The portability  is great  easily slips in your pocket and functions are very fast Camera takes fabulous pictures as well battery drains overnight OK going from an S4 to an S7 is a big leapand there are a few hiccups  but thus far I LOVE it  Mostlyits the much faster processor and the new Marshmallow operating system We were used to the S6 when it came time to upgrade the transition was smooth and the improved features are easy to learn I bought it roughly 10 days ago and have very positive experience with new features and extended battery life Gorgeous screen easy to navigate amazing photos fun voice features  BUT IT HAS HUGE DRAWBACK You wont know anyone has left you a voice message unless you have data turned on  So much for economizing by only using WiFi  Because voice message notifications will not come through the phone connection or a WiFi connection  I was told that only by having data turned on will I get notice that someone has left a phone message  So when traveling overseas unless youre wealthy and can buy a lot of data access you wont ever know if you have voice mail unless you continuously dial in  Why on earth did they change the voice mail system so that a phone connection alone is not enough but you HAVE to have data turned on Traded in my Iphone 5C and the antenna was so much better on the Iphone  I think the antenna in the Galaxy7 is weak  The large size takes getting used to also bought is and still can not upload photos and videos to my mac Else a great phone Much clearer faster more storage Some aspects of this phone are great such as easy connection to google uploading music deleting numbers ability to increase memory and easy to use camera On the negative sides the app buttons are confusing and all over the constant flashing light on the front is annoying the message system is ridiculous with floating dots and multisystems to use this phone also doesnt have motion pictures Overall i think its good but could use some work Purchased this phone a week ago and am extremely pleased with this device Great phone Fast possessor and sleek design Love the gold color Large and readable  Great product to use Is a great phone Slim design awesome in anything I wear around We love out new phones Over All GS7 delivers speed awesome camera and photos among many other great features Ive only had it for 1 week so still getting used to the upgrade  I like the bigger screen and it seems to be faster positive things
love the voice text translator since i hate to type
the camera is awesome
it gets more user friendly ever day
i like the fact that it is water tight saved me money on buying a water proof case
i picked this phone because it has a removable chip for expanded memory

not so good
could not find any wear to set up voice mail
contacted tech service and it turned out being very simple
adding a pic to text could not find any help i just got lucky and hit the right button
now it is a piece of cake
need to focus on more of the basic simple things that the basic user would like to setup so they do not come back with horror stories It has  only been a couple of weeks but all of the features of the S6 are present  My only concern is I lose coverage in different parts of my home  I didnt have this problem with the S6 I switched from the Galaxy S4 to the S7 I really like the new home feature that lets you quick close all the open apps instead of having to longpress the home key
However I really miss the option to use the volume key to adjust the font size in text messages automatically instead of having to dig it out of an options submenu Also neither of the messaging apps will let me customize the bubble message style the way you used to be able to on the S4 
Overall functionality on the S7 is much speedier and the apps mostly run smoother than on the S4 Batterylife is improved so it lasts all day even with heavy GPS use The alwayson screen feature with the clock  calendar is awesome so I dont have to actually blip the screen on to see what time it is 
Love love love that its 32 GB internal storage with the expandable slot up to 200GB as I have a large catalog of music that I like to haul around with me via the SD card 
Although theres a few things I miss from my old phone I am more or less very satisfied with this upgrade I hav3e used this phone for a week and it is everything I expected Qutie an improvement from my SG S5 The phone hardware is terrific but the problem is that both Samsung and Verizon load useless apps some of which cannot be removed I was able to get all of the games off although a pop up screen keeps coming up for a game optimizer  The more serious issue is with the software updates Every time I have accepted the update something bad happens to the phone  Right now the phones works fine I wish there was a way to stop the updates permanently On one of my other phones Samsung S6 after the update the phone was nonfunctional and after wiping it it still could not be restored Obviously I will not take the update on the new phone Very satisfied with quick response to choices Bright clear pictures Went to the Galaxy S7 from the Galaxy S4 My wife Instagrams photos that I take  with the S4 she said I took excellent photos with the S7 she cant believe the difference She cantake wait to get her a new phone she has the S5 and its almost time to upgrade She knows what shes getting next Still getting used to other features but what a difference I love it My info was brought in from old phone or so I was told However I cannot find a calendar app in what came on new phone to bring in the information from the calendar on the old phone   I think what I was using on old phone is what came on it however last update created some issues on the old one Why do updates mess up what you have us using  I know that updates have messed with my calendar before changing how it looks seemkng to make it work different Better pictures better battery life ease of transferring documentsitems from old to new  Went to local store and they said I had most moved over  Customer Service was very helpful  Few things Different but not that big deal Phone has treated me well so far No complaints Dog is People watching Memo app ink
Or ink pad does not transfer your old data to your new phone It is lost in air space Twice this has happened and very very annoying I had the s5 for 2 years  and upgraded to the s7 Love it I love that it charges so fast and it has the time display on the front all the time It has lots of custom backgrounds and themes to choose from Just upgraded my Galaxy S6 to the S7 and am glad I did My S6 was the best phone I had ever used and I really liked itFast sleek and great features The S7 surpasses the S6 especially with the higher capacity battery Big enough but not too big It is a great looking phone and I have noticed a significant improvement in battery endurance over my Galaxy S5 It runs pretty smoothly though some of the keyboard spots on the lower edge of the screen are not as sensitive as I would like We bought this a week ago after the old one went for a swim and I love it already I bought my phone a week ago and I love it  The camera is great I am so glad I chose this phone I have only had this phone about 2 weeks  It seems solid enough for a Galaxy phone  I liked my S5 and I like they brought back removable memory  I still hate the bloat ware I have to disable and for the life of me cant understand why verizon still puts VZ Navigator on a phone  Overall phone seems to be in line with most of the past Samsung Phones I have owned My daughter and I both have one and we absolutely love the camera Ive never seen a phone with this many options for photos Definitely feel much safer knowing it was shatter if it slides to the floor and its waterproof What took so long to include more safety Either way we love it and would highly recommended to anyone Ive had this phone for 1 week and I love it Little changes here and there Battery definitely stays cooler and prolongs charge Upgrading from the old S4 to this was well worth the wait Neat features and fast processor No complaints Still learning the features  but I like the phone overall Had for a few weeks so far no problem Very pleased with this phone I really like the new features over my galaxy s5 active Battery and reception is so much better than my S4 The S5 was OK the S6 not as good but this S7 is on a whole different level and I love it Just bought last week Nice and easy to use Love the camera the battery seems to die quicker than the S5 but still lasts long enough  Do not like that the edges have a small taper roundness to them where the nice tempered glass screen covers can not completely stick to the whole screen on the edges Id prefer a flat screen with no tapercurve on the edges HATE IT  ITS TERRIBLE  I WANT MY OLD BLACKBERRY BACK  I CANT GET VOICE MAIL SET UP AND I HAVE TO HIT FOUR BUTTONS TO EVEN GET TO MY HOME PAGE  HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT This is a fantastic phone Worth the money The Samsung Galaxy S7 offers so many fantastic features The Samsung S7 is an amazing device with a ton of functionality and unbelievable battery life Great phone and tough too There are so many things I dont understand about the use of this phone  Why wasnt there an instruction book with it  Ive tried using the Help iconbut its not very clear And why dont  all the icons appear all the time I really like the s7 My old phone was an s4 so this is a huge step for me The camera on the s7 is the clearest I have seen My brother has an iPhone 6s and I think this is better Plus this is waterresistant Have owned the S7 for 23 weeks works well but not that there is a WOW factor  Not sure what was improved other than added memory The S7 does not function as well as the Iphone 6s did While making a phone call and need to type in an extension the screen will go in and out making it difficult to type in the extension very frustating I hate this phone and would love to return it Cuts in  out during calls No regular voicemail  very few apps speech to text is a joke it never gets the words correct S4 was better useseats data just sitting  cant turn off notifications doesnt recognize current email Google other accounts  passworder wont  accept password resets ie invalid My S4 was much better except camera This phones options are like my way or the highway and thats  where it might end up Also the new Verizon app is the worst cant  change or set anything Change it back I had a Note prior to this S7 and loved it I no longer required the extra features that the note came with so down sized It took a little getting good used to regarding the smaller size but Im loving it so far The battery lasts a long time hours of Pokémon playing without a needed charge and man does it charge fast when its time The camera takes amazing pictures and maneuvering around the phone is as easy as it has always been I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for an upgrade or a change of brand Regarding the reviews about it flying out of your hands it is light I bought a clear rubber case for it I wanted to see the gold tone of the phone and it stays securely in my hand no slipping I bought my Samsung Galaxy 7 about a week ago  I am still in the process of learning the newer features but I am VERY happy with it This phone is perfect  Great speaker and camera  Easy to use  I had a Galaxy S5 before and this one is better I bought this about a week ago and it blows the S5 I had way out of the water Much needed upgrade Replaced an older Galaxy with the S7 So far so good Needed a new phone since galaxy s4 wouldnt hold a charge any longer New one is mostly the same 2weeks and I love it upgraded from s5 witch  I loved So far so good hope it lasts for a long time Bought 727 Contact list transferredbut without email addresses Not good Had class today still no way to fix it I went from a samsung 24th to this phone I really enjoy the upgrade The only thing I dont like about the phone is I use the swype feature and it doesnt seem to flow smooth I have had Samsung Android phones for years and I enjoy their ease of use and their reliability Great phone  nice size It was easy to update everything from my last phone  The screen is super clear but gets finger prints on it immediately  I like the fingerprint security as it makes opening the device much quicker and the double tap to open the camera is also very convenient So far Im not impressed  Ive had it a little over a week and the battery barely lasts the day and it keeps freezing It fell off a step on my patio less than a foot and cracked the screen Ive had a lot of phones drop a lot higher in the past and never cracked a screen before Extremely disappointed with Samsung I have wanted it for months Then I filed a claim with best buy and they still havent sent me my replacement So I just decided to go to the store and upgrade I just upgraded from an s4 and Im glad I did Only had it a week and loving it Ive had this S7  for 2 weeks and so far so good Very fast had the galaxy s5 before this one seems like a very fantastic version of that phone Would highly recommend upgrading to any Samsung users The Galaxy S7 is full of a plethora of functionality and easy to use with features that I did not even know were or could be made available for use in a phone I have had my phone now for about a week  I love all the options I have along with the sound and pictures it takes  Its exactly what I wanted in a smart phone Just not crazy about the recording feature on texting Best camera of any smart phone I have owned Features and functions are in different places Wish Android phones were more easily transitioned but overall love the new phone Glad to finally be back to a Galaxy I purchased the Galaxy 7 online and am a bit disappointed that it not much different than my 5 Simple move from an Galaxy S4 to the S7  Love the new phone and the performance is exceptional I love this phone and there are so many great features but you have to charge it twice a day It has a great camera with panoramic virtual shot  360 view slow motion hyperlapse and live broadcast It has a MicroSD card slot Bluetooth works great as well as the fingerprint sensor I just started using the S Health and Im loving the S Voice There are so many goodies packed in this phone What can I say Its a great phone and its water resistant Now if the battery would last a full day Id give it 5 stars I love the Samsung phone cause they seem very user friendly Just upgraded from S5 to S7 and could not be happier Super fast slick device has all the features I wanted the phone is the biggest pile of garbage GPS works off and on battery life is horriblethe only saving grace is the cameratoo bad im not a full time photographer and I actually need to use a phone for just that making calls Got it for the wife she loves it very powerful bright display and so many ways to customize Have always been a huge fan of Samsung products The S7 with Verizon wireless there none who compare to reliability and support Thanks Terrible phone Slow loading email overly sensitive screen TERRIBLE sound quality and WiFi connection issues no other device has connection issues What a waste of money And I despise that the glass cover doesnt actually fit the screen so there is a edge gap all the way around the phone screen I bought it because it received great reviews and I seriously dont understand why Great Phone Easy to use And take Beautiful Picture Keep your S5 and add the wireless charger adapter Just used my upgrade from note 5  Im disappointed mainly in the speed of the phone  It is much slower at handling simple things  then my note 5  Other then that the phone is OK  The camera is OK but still seems to note compare to the note Seems like bugs havent been worked out and the IMAP function is serious flawed Just upgraded from a Galaxy 5 to a 7love it Hubby is enjoying his as well I am very happy with it so far See no differences between S4 and now S7 WISH I hadnt tried to upgradenot even speed is differentexpected MORE The phone is easy to set up and use I enjoy the apps in the Google Play store much better than the Windows Phone store or the iPhone However I give a poor rating because the battery life is pathetic It has a high mAh rating but the battery does not last but about 75 of a work day with mild use Ive tried closing apps and doing other tricks for battery management but those do not work If I did not have a wireless charger at my desk my phone would never make it through the day
I wish I would have just gotten the iPhone even though I absolutely detest Apple At least their products work I got this phone a week ago and I hate it So far I love the phone but still trying to figure out why some of the button functionalities were changed  It is taking some adjustment  Takes GREAT pictures Just got my new phone a week  ago and love it I havent had my new phone for very long but so far Im very happy with it Love the features Camera works awesome Battery life is great A big change from my two year old HTC One M8 but Im glad I did The changeover was not that difficult HTC 10 was my next choice but I liked the camera better on this one and everything else seemed like a toss up Better aftermarket case and accessory availability as well A week in and I am still extremely pleased with the decision Glad I traded my s4 for s7   battery life is awesome Needed to upgrade my phone and very happy with the Samsung  Galaxy S7 I went into the phone store and simply stated to them that I wanted a camera that could also function as a phone They directed me to the Samsung S7 and so far I have been very pleased with the quality It has an amazing camera Some of LGs features that I had gotten used to are not the same on this phone it will just take a matter of time before I understand how the same functions work on this phone Overall  it has been the perfect choice for me I have had this phone for about one month and cant say enough good things about it When I bought my first smartphone 2 years ago I passed on a Samsung for reasons I no longer remember But almost immediately I began regretting my decision So when my plan was up I promptly went to the store and bought the S7
The battery life is outstanding in power save mode I barely notice that some features are not running in background I get through the day with power to spare 
The camera is my favorite application on this phone The shutter lag is almost zero so action shots of sports and pets are predictable and blur free see attached dog in flight The colors are true without adjustment The builtin photo editing tools contain everything most casual photographers could want
I operate mostly in a wifi environment indoors but when Im outside the 4G kicks in without a hitch
The fact that we live on a lake makes the waterproof feature a real plus Ive operated the camera while wading neck deep in the water and during a heavy rain My wet fingers were no problem for the touch screen Still getting used to it but I like it So far I have had the new phone 2 weeks and am loving it  Much better camera many new features holds a charge much longer and overall is a great phone great battery life clarity of sound Best phone Ive ownedTakes great pictures and videos expendable sd memory card
water proof
size is just right for me
speed charge is great of smart phone charge fast less than 15 hrs done Fast processor large memory amazing graphics and so much more Why own a computer when you can have this  I absolutely do not understand why the phone does not come in whitethats the only reason why i hesitate to buy this phone I love my Samsung s7 Itso very user friendlyhowever none of my content came over from my old android and my bf logged into something and all of his content from his iPhone uploaded to the new phone Missing my pics I have to pull back from the cloud in order to use on shutterfly My phone tends to get really hot often
I also wish there was cover for charging port and aux port I was trying to hold on to my Galaxy S4 Active and I really saw no need to get a new phone Long story short I dropped my phone whIle changing the case and the screen shattered I took that as a sign from the universe that I needed a new phone My switch to the S7 Edge has been the easiest phone move Ive ever had The camera is amazing the battery lasts forever and transfering my contacts apps and photos was a breeze I couldnt be happier If youre on the edge no pun intended of getting this phone or another choose this one You wont regret it  I like the phone but I dont like the interface Yes I know I can download apps What I dont like is Verizon Holly Molly they are expensive Fast smooth responsive and very pleasing design I bought this phone about two weeks ago and so far it has been great The camera on this phone is fantastic Im a little worried though that that battery dies quickly Otherwise great purchase Had the phone for a couple weeks and really like it This being my 5th Samsung phone starting with the mythic in a row it has lived up to expectations and then some The best screen yet very fast and the micro SD is back which is way I did not get the 6 last year The only issue I have had is the lack of support from 3rd party screen protector vendors not being able to make one that actually worksstays on Finally went with the otter box defender the only issue is the screen is a little less as responsive but I can live with that In my line of work I need phone protection Got it for my wife and she loves it Feeling a little phone envy and ready to get a one I bought my new phone a week ago and am glad I did The only issue I have with it is the one speaker being located where the mic is If you hold the phone to your headear when makingreceiving calls the other callers voice will come from the end of the phone closest to your mouth instead of your ear I picked the phone because I needed something with an SD slot Phone battery is very good Decent performance as well I found the setup is a little difficult and very time consuming However loved my Galaxy 6 and now love my Galaxy 7 Overall  love it Upgrading from the s4 to the s7 is like trading in you old Buick for a new Cadillac  Sure the old Buick was a reliable ride but the new Caddy is hotter and faster I bought it a month ago and I am so happy I did This phone is great like it has some of the iPhone stuff but this galaxy by its self is awesome I like that it has Microsoft programs already loaded and that they work All the apps that were loaded are great And I like the new design Out of any phones out on the market I know Samsungs phones would be my top pick The phone itself amazes me It has the coolest features I ever seen before Great products The Samsung 7 is a really nice phone Of course all phones are pricey but you get what you pay for I hade a Samsung S5 that I really liked So when it started acting up I kept putting off looking into getting another phone But I finally had to give in and get a new phone I got the Galaxy S7 and I am so glad that I bought this phone I love it even more than I loved my S5 I have been an iPhone user for a few years now and just decided to switch to Samsung and I love my new device The features included in this phone are beyond what you cando on other devices I love this new phone Its fast picture quality is clear The camera is amazing It automatcally downloaded the apps I had on my last phone Seamless transtion Im glad I chose this phone very unrootable If you are a fan of worthless apps that cannot be uninstalled by golly this is the perfect phone for you it is a great phone with great service Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and its the best decision Ive made Best phone Ive gotten so far I was a long time fan of the forbidden fruit but after this phone never again It blows my daughters 6s plus out if the water Shes always looking over my shoulder when Im exploring the different functions Very pleased Have owned a week Definitely like shorter charging time and longer battery life Excellent value great design solid phone Has to be one of the best out there now Highly recommended Make sure you get a case to protect it though Contract was expiring and got a great deal on this phone  It works as expected and have no complaints Went from a Droid and still learninf6how to edit  and some others features6 I moved from a windows driven phone to my first Android device with this Samsung S7 phone I very much like this phone after learning the format it is easy to use aND works well with my frequently used apps I bought this phone over a week ago and has been living up to expectations I upgraded from a galaxy s5 to the s7 The speakers are louder and the battery life is so much better I also like the customization capabilities I had a Galaxy 4 for years then switched to a competitor 6 I kept it about 3 months and switched back I missed all of the features available on a Galaxy The only thing I miss after switching is telling it to text someone Im sure this has it I just havent figured out the phone yet My old phone was starting to become troublesome to own due to the length of time I had it I pulled the trigger on the new S7 and am enjoying the new OS power saving camera and flexibility of it I would recommend this phone to anyone who tends to keep their phone for many years before upgrading It feels like it was built to last
One contrast to the pros of this phone is not necessarily a knock on it but on all new phones and that is how easy it is to slip out of your hand I have purchased an external case for mine but there were a few times that I almost dropped it because of how sleek and slippery it is Excellent phone wish I had gotten it sooner I love my new phone  Itseems enough like my 4 that I can find things but updated to be even easier to use Great phone overall My only problem overall is that my speakers tend to cut out and it really bothers me Just simply blown away The design the ease the power Its all amazing for a phone And the camera is probably the best part Pro mode has changed the game when it comes to digital cameras Dont get me wrong I really enjoyed my time as abVerizon iPhone user But as someone who truly believes these gadgets are meant to simplify life I found that the iPhone was making mine more complicated You see I am a PC user and trying to seamlessly sync my iPhone with my MS Outlook Calendar and Contacts was a constant nightmare During syncs contact info would get scrambled And I hated the fact that iTunes counted how many times I played a song etc I also couldnt stand how they controlled my data storage on the device The Samsung Galaxy S7 really allows me to control my experience Even the camera is awesome For very little money I picked up a SIM card and am now able to really take all of my music and pictures with me without taxing the phones internal storage This is the smart phone experience I have been waiting for New to the family but will be staying for awhile I was a previous android user however the usability and versatility is unrivaled by any other android phone Ive used thus far Love the built in features like battery save and Samsung pay My previous phone was a Galaxy S5 and it was my first Samsung phone I had been a diehard Droid person until then I loved my S5 but this S7 is just amazing I love the fast startup the battery life is excellent its slightly smaller and lighter than the S5 but with the same size screen All of the features are excellent Its just an amazing phone This is a great phone all around It does exactly what I need and more I love the pictures that it takes I cant believe the quality sometimes especially in low light conditions I have never had a phone that took such good photos with such poor lighting I have owned the S3 Note 3 and Note 5 in the past and loved all of those devices I was ready to make the switch to a smaller size I like that they added the SD card and increased the battery The performance is top notch Overall a very good phone Bought this a few weeks ago and its been a great addition It runs much faster and has better graphics and screen While there are many cheaper Android phones out there nothing comes close to Galaxy S7 Edge I love the design and performance There are no negatives expect that due to the curved screen  no case can provide complete protection and the phones screen shatters when dropped And it is quite expensive to repair 

But otherwise I love this phone You cannot go wrong with it so sorry I ever upgraded from Samsung 4 This started when someone ordered a new phone using my name but it wasnt me and I had to report fraud Then I did come in to Verizon to upgrade my phone due to broken screen Since then it has been a DIASTER the phone is possessed and auto regulates volume changes programs without me touching the phone will not auto connect to home wireless service I have had to make 3 trips to a Verizon store to try to get the phone fixed and online 4 times I bought this 1 week ago and it barely stays charged the back is also glass so it was broken on the second day the wireless charger shuts itself off at 100 so when you pick it up for work in the morning its down to 65 100 times the adds adware and incompatible programs as the SG 5 and the spellchecker is worse than the old one I have had my S7 for a few months now  I am still learning all that this power house can do I love how fast it is how long my battery lasts  the awesome pics I have taken I will have this solid rugged fun phone for years to come  maybe by then Ill know exactly what all it is capable of lol I have owned various other brands of phones but once I switched to Samsung years ago with the S3 I knew I had found the brand for me  it is the only one I will recommend to family  friends Get yours today  youll not be sorry D Love this phone  Much more than I expected  Great sound quality and video I liked this phone and LOVE the front flash and the underwater functions I just wished that they figured out the advanced calling for all carriers It was nerve wracking to make the switch from iPhone to Android The S7 Edge certainly had many features which made it easier to transition
 I love the feel of the phone  feels solid 
 I love how it looks  sharp edgy  pardon the pun
 the photo quality  so different from the iPhone
Though I love the simplicity the iPhone provides I enjoy the many advanced things I can do with the Android system
I dont see going back to iPhone after this I Love it It takes great pictures and videos Great phone I love my s7 edge I am a happy customer because Samsung is always innovating technology and design For many years Ive been using samsung and give it 10 stars I JUST GOT THIS THIS JULY AND I HATE IT MY 4 WAS BETTER EASIER TO USE KEYBROAD LETTERS ARE TO SMALL I like the big letters and numbers I was an avid iPhone user for years and it died after warranty so I wanted to try something different and this s7 is great Wish I switched earlier Love the camera better pictures than a stand alone camera I love this phone and its ease of use Designwise its very sleek and nice to hold The size is perfect and makes surfing the web or using Google easy 

This phone also hooks up perfectly to my new VW Golf I love using Google maps and the phone connectivity and text messaging works great 

By the way I replaced my Iphone 6S with the new Galaxy 7 Thats a statement in itself Hands down my favorite phone ever Best phone on the market Has been a great phone with all kinds of fun features and plenty of power Ive been a Samsung fan since the A900 flip phone and my Galaxy 7s is no exception Very happy so far Ive prior owned Galaxy S3 and S5 Quick to open all apps good camera decent battery life With the 7th iteration of the Samsung Galaxy its become a really awesome phone I am coming from an S5 and there are certainly some improvements that have been made to include longer battery life an easier charging plugin at the bottom of the phone a better camera a faster processor and more space which is also expandable with a spot to add a micro SD memory card Match all that up with the quality and user friendly experience of the Android operating system and you have a phone that will certainly not let you down Purchase this phone and you will not regret it On the con side I think my S5 actually charged a little faster but once charged the S7 definitely lasts longer Plus with the addition of the built in wireless charging it absolutely makes charging a whole lot easier The plugin on the S5 was very difficult to use Also Ive had some issues with my WiFi connections  seems like the S7 is slow to recognize available networks and at times some connectivity issues Overall though the WiFi works as expected Bottom Line This is a great phone that shows a lot of sophistication and is a clear representation of the years of experience and trial and error that Samsung has went through with its previous phones  it just does everything well I love everything about the new S7 But the screen capture is very handy And the water proof feature should be wonderful I have drowned 2 previous smart phones This is my first Samsung phone and I am more than pleasantly surprised at the quality and features The Samsung apps work great on top of Android the phone feels great sounds great easy to use I love the PC Sidesync app so I can access the phone from the PC including making  receiving calls using my PC speakers and microphone Fast water resistant and long battery life Lasted 2 days when I wasnt too active on it Would suggest it too anyone Healthy phone  a happy customer Most phones seem to excel in one area or another but this one seems to be great all the way The software is top notch the performance is better than I expected and the hardware is thin and light but sturdy The camera quality is phenomenal and fast My previous phones were both high end phones from other leading manufacturers and I enjoyed both but this one is a far cry from either

Pros Sturdy and lightweight great camera Extremely easy to use Bright colorful display Long battery life Expandable memory Water resistant

Cons Pricey but not more than the competing brand phones on the market I have been a loyal Galaxy user since the S4 I am very pleased with the S7 Its incredibly fast very user friendly and intuitive Has allowed me to be more productive Battery life is very long even with heavy usage I would highly recommend this phone Didnt plan on upgrading my phone but I am glad I did Easy to set up and use and much more functional I upgraded from S4 and the S7 seems to work so much easier Great phone and services Hands down on of the best devices on the market Highly recommended to my friends and family Samsung and Verizon have done it again LOVE IT Photos are crisp and detailed  Phone runs smoothly and is effortless to learn This is an amazing phone VERY fast opening apps and doing anything else I can think of Great phone even better service It is not that much different than the S4 but I did have some operational issues with the S4 I wish the font were bigger It is fast and the battery 1 week out does seem to be lasting longer My husband lost his Galaxy S4 He doesnt like new technology so I gave him my Galaxy S5 and I got the new Galaxy S7 Love it Love this phone smaller and easier to handle not as heavy Glad the edge is now a swipe feature and not an actual edge like my previous Note Edge Had frequently called numbers on one of the edge screens and would inadvertently call someone when scrolling through the edge Ive only had my S7 less than a month This is my first Samsung phone and Im enjoying every moment of this new device I like the feel of it in my small hands for me I wouldnt want it any larger this is the perfect size Performance is also so great and the photos are crystal clear I only wish Samsung had made it so you could touch anywhere on the screen to take a picture rather than the camera icon I discover something new almost everydayweek Ill just keep using and making new discoveries I love all the features and details that this product has to offer Samsung makes really great phones and by far I think this is the best one If you cant decide which phone to get than get this phone samsung s7 or you could also get the Samsung s7 edge This phone offers an overall great experience and is very good looking at the same time With all the features that this offers there isnt much you can complain about Compared to the rest of the market there isnt a better phone but that doesnt mean that this doesnt have its faults Sense this is the ATT variant there is a lot of bloatware on here that is unnecessary and a very ugly ATT logo plastered on the back that isnt removable butt that is the only thing that really bothers me the rest of the phone is great I am still getting acquainted with this phone but my initial experience has been excellent I am looking forward to learning more about what it can do for me Ive had my new phone a little over a week and so far Im loving it Overall a great phone Upgraded from S4 to the S6 and am very pleased with my choice Battery life is significantly better  though still not as great as the non Android product  but that one difference is not worth switching This phone has so many features Im still discovering some as I play with it Another issue I have with each Samsung phone Ive had the ringtones are just sad I always download an app to get much better ones Since I have the app Im not holding this against the phone The camera is amazing the quality is as good if not better than some of my DSLR camera shots and it certainly has more features than the DSLR does I LOVE that I can add on more memory It holds so much I dont know if Ill ever fill it up now The fact that its water resistant  HUGE plus I dont have the nerve to test it under water but I do feel better doing simple things such as leaving it in my shirt pocket while running through the torrential downpours and not worrying about it getting ruined The wireless charging is a perfect solution to the tiny microusb that over time wears out on any device The bright clear display even in daytime is wonderful No more hunching over trying to create shade to see it This is my FIRST NEW LATEST MODEL phone Ive purchased and I couldnt be happier

The battery life is GREAT  the features are efficient and easy to use  its FAST  I LOVE IT Love this phone Great product My wife and I both upgraded from Galaxy S4s to the S7s They were the perfect upgrades for us It has most of the same old features and options we were used to only a major boost in performance and usability I have had a lot of cell phones in my time but this phone by far does everything anyone could ever ask forThe best phone ever and I recommend it to everyone Fits nicely in my hands battery lasts a long time even when playing games and performance is excellent I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to a really great cell phone at Samsung Galaxy S7 It is much easier to use Really enjoy my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Upgraded from the S6 earlygreat move The S7 Edge is sleek sexy and powerful Love it love how the waterproofing is back the SD card slot is back exited love the bright display its a realy good with multitasking no lag or freezing fast charge is realy fast only down side is the less megapixles on the camera but makes it up with the new features and missing IR blaster remote other than that an excellent Love my phone Intuitive and easy to use Fast and great clear definition of screen The phone is nice easily to use Screen is beautiful pictures clear and crisp Battery life is awful I had it on battery savings mode while i slept and the battry went down 40 when i didnt even touch it for 7 hrs Yes it charges quickly but that does me no good when i have to charge it 3x a day and i dont even use it for facebook I took i back and got a iphone S now i am happy with the iphone the charge lasting well over 48hrs If battery is important this is NOT the phone for you I like the ease of use Very similar to the s5 but much improved Love the phone so far Looking forward to testing it out more Better camera nice feel and touch to keyboard Screen flashed on and off Google play store didnt work Had to reset phone Going back to Note 5 I  like the new Samsung Galaxy Having difficulty with FB pictures on gallery I get a message  unfortunately Gallery has stopped working So the Verizon representative put it into a safe mode So that there would not be a third party app open A bit confused especially when paying so much for the phone I used to have a Galaxy S3 moved to a Droid Turbo and am now back to the Samsung Galaxy S7  So far Im pleased  It fits in my hand better than the Droid which was big  The button configuration is a little different but Im getting used to it  My main complaints are 1 the phone is so slim and compact it feels a bit dainty and I worry it will shatter if it falls  Problem solved with a good phone case  2 holding the phone with my left hand my pad below my thumb would very often activate the Q or A key inadvertently when texting with my thumb  The edge of the screen is so close and the phone so thin that accidental text gets entered easily  Again solved with a good case

So far I am pleased with the phone  Oh and so far the camera is the best Ive seenused in a smart phone so far I needed an upgrade The salesman was Perfect he did not misguide me not that he could Im satisfied I love everything about this phone  The iphone is good but Im really enjoying this phone I love my new phone it has great features and overall a great buy Ive had it just over one week and have enjoyed all the features Bought this phone last week Everything about is wonderful Feels good in my hand Screen in amazing Fast great features Samsung Pay is great it blows peoples minds it is truly a revolutionary way to pay Every cell phoneTV Ive ever had has been Samsung you guys are great and put out awesome quality products I went from the galaxy note 4 to the Galaxy s7 Im very impressed with the quality of the picturesvideos best Ive even seen Performance is awesome its super fast I love how I dont need to worry if I drop it or get it wet Well worth the money SAMSUNG FOR LIFE I love love love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 It is very sleek thin and light The picture quality is amazing and I love the fact it is water resistant The display is excellent I would recommend this phone to anyone Im an Android girl at heart So far so good Performs up to my expectation If you want it you have it on this phone Camera on this phone is awesome I had a S6 edge before bit the S7 is far and away a better phone I liked the S6 but the battery was inadequate  The S7 is great  I can use it all day without having to recharge it  The SHealth app is great for keeping tabs on my heart  Fingerprint login is very easy  Overall it really is a very good phone I like Samsung Just got it and still learning Another fantastic Samsung productGood quality
Would say it has too much bloatware I love my S7 Im not great with technology but this phone is easy to use Im not liking it right nowmaybe after I learn how to correctly use it I will feel differently Its to sensitive its to difficult to operate I cant believe how difficult it is to make a group list I guess its made for kids because my grandson can operate it better than me This is the best 1 I ever own love everything about it I own 2 all the features are great Ill recommend it to everyone
Angel Just switched from an S5 to an S7 and I love it  Everything transferred smoothly  texts pictures apps etc and quickly  The S7 is faster but still easy to use Samsung has took all the great parts from the past galaxies an made few things better an made the s7  great phone The only downside about this phone is the fact that the stronger battery is on the edge and not the standard s7 The battery does not disappointed though 

The edge screen is very nice Makes images and text seemingly pop out The only downside is that reaching across the phone to tap something sometimes causes my palm to accidently touch the screen because of it as well which as you can imagine can be annoying A good case can solve this though I loved my s6 and went to add a line but they only had s7 So I ended up getting an s7 for the new line and upgrading from my s6 to a v10 for a week And it just didnt suit me So i went back and exchanged that for an s7 So much happier I guess Ill have to stick with my galaxies Sleek stylish and advanced 
Ill keep it simple everything you could want from current generation technology packed oh so sweetly into 1 phone
Brilliant display amazing battery life expandable storage water resistance top notch camera processing power on par with a pc and an amazing operating system 

what more could you really ask for out of a phone I upgraded my phone from the Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy S7 I liked my S5 and really didnt have any problems with it but it was time to upgrade This new phone so fast Everything loads fast everything executes fast Moving my data my contacts my music everything was so easy I have always been a fan of Android and this phone is the best one yet The phone has a beautiful sleek modern design Easy to hold and fits in the hand The design is beautiful and it certainly has the power and storage capacity snd power to generate documents in microsoft office It can handle almost unlimitrd apps without loss of power The camera is amazing It has the ability to compete with expensive cameras If Samsung sold a variety of micro macro and low power telephoto lenses to go with it
I have noticed a couple of things it could improve on 
It occasionally becomes unresponsive if my left hand cradles the lower left side of the phone Once it changed a name in my contacts list I like my S7 Edge a lot Just that I am not big fan of curve edge thing but otherwise its very good I love my Samsung 7 phone I recently got this and Im very happy Easy to use clear pictures I didnt have any issues with transition Phone is gooddoesnt connect to my wifi right awayand have to disconnect and reconnect to b4 browsing I just purchased this phone  Very nice thin and compact  Wish Verizon store had shown me how to use it  Classes outside of store were very expensive Best Phone Ive ever had started with an S4 so this was a major upgrade Love the edge Upgraded from Moto x 2nd gen Its a great phone I love the themes and it seems to do some great pictures One thing it fails at though is voice control On my moto I could say play My Chemical Romance on Spotify and it would launch Spotify and play the playlist On the s7 it somehow concatenates the phrase into gibberish it cant understand at all That was very useful for me when Im stuck in traffic So 1 star for what I feel is a pretty crucial feature that SHOULD be working better in newer phones The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a marvelous product that I would most definitely recommend to my friends Most of everything I do is on my phone because of the phones high speed processor and sleek user friendly design The phones camera is magnificent allowing for hd quality photos along with an easy means to share your new beautiful pictures Love how the phone is waterproof and has a SD slot avaliable now I upgraded to the S7 edge from the iPhone 6 The differences are amazing The screen of the edge is beautiful and the extra real estate from the curved screen makes an amazing difference in screen size The phone is packed full of features the expandable memory is always a plus and all in all its an amazing phone The only two issues I have with it are 1 the battery life is noticeably shorter than the iphone Sure you can change up a bunch of settings and turn on battery saving mode but right out of the box the battery life is a bit short 2 I noticed that when in the same areas using the same carrier my signal is generally weaker than with the iphone and I have more dropped calls While both of these are an annoyance its still a great phone and the additional features and ability to customize the phone make the phone worth the upgrade over the iphone Many features are better than my old galaxy 3 but some are actually worse The Bluetooth streaming to my accord isnt very good takes forever to connect doesnt show info on the cars display like the 3 does The battery is way worse had the galaxy 3 for 6 years and the battery still lasted longer than the 7 The camera is easy better on the 7 The music player isnt as good as the 3the speaker was better on the 3 So over all I like the 7 but they should have left a lot alone The Samsung s7 is an amazing phoneI love everthing about itits a very user friendlytakes great picturesits awesome Everything works as advertised I myself use the 200Gb MicroSD card and it works very well Terrific for storage I guess I need time to learn new things on the phone Water proof is very good Gave it to my son and he loves it The battery on this phone is amazing and the power saving modes are even better The high definition is amazing I have had no problems with this phone or any Samsung products that I own I just upgraded two weeks ago and I cannot put this beautiful piece of technology down Every time I pick it up I discover something new and awesome about it The wraparound screen makes the screen content flawless Im sure there will be some quirks down the road but the pluses will out way them Im so happy I went with this device Never looking back Ive had an S S2 S4 S5 and now the S7 The refinements on the new phone make it the easiest to operate of all the ones before I really like the new Android Marshmallow OS and the individual application permissions I dont see the difference except the water portion Kinda sad I bought it Switched over from the note 5 to the s7 and Im in love Does everything I need plus more I love this phone as I love all Samsung products Samsung S7 Edge is a great phone  It takes wonderful pictures The volume is good I love that is water proof also I never had a Samsung I like the performance The screen is super clear camera is amazing It charge super fast The only issue I had was how sensitive the screen was But once I got a case it was fine Overall its a great buy for me Phone is too complex I love the way this phone feels in hand and the edge feature is truly something unique The performance is excellent I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to the Galaxy S7 and the S7 is a lot better and smoother than the S4 I like the larger feel to the phone and the way it sits in my hand The phone does get hot while using it for long periods of time The battery is pretty good but if you are a heavy user you will have to charge it at some point in the day All and all Im very pleased with the phone I recently changed from my Galaxy Note 5 to the new S7 I havent been disappointed This phone packs some amazing features I primarily switched because of the camera It is great in low light and takes amazing pictures I take all of my pictures now using only my phone There are too many other reasons to promote this phone I am still learning even more about it everyday Well done Samsung I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 The battery life is great The features of this phone are wonderful and it is highly intuitive It has improved greatly over my last Samsung phone The camera is amazing and all the new features make this one of the best phones from Samsung Absolutely flawless Easy to use This is my eighth day  I use very few functions  The phone performs well so far I want the new active or edge but Im content with this as well I can do so much at once and its so fast I love Samsung anything kp up da work I work for ATT So as you can imagine I deal with a lot of phones Samsung has always been my favorite The S6 series left me feeling like there always couldve been more But the S7 line blew me away I cant wait to see whats next to come Samsung listened to its users and made sure the S7 had all the most important features It continues to have great build quality Samsung brought back support for microSD expansion Also Samsung retains the awesome Android experience instead of trying to make the S7 more like an iPhone ie LG G5 The S7 has a superb camera its fast and has great battery life It puts out enough power through its microUSB port to feed my portable DAC and the S7 can withstand water splashes Im glad that I waited for the S7 and it is the best phone in years phone works in everyway you could imagine and does most things for modern cellphones that you would need it to nothing more to say Always like my Note3 but decided to downsize a bit without losing the Samsung Android features Samsung has always seemed to be ahead of the competition when it came to there tablets Now it is ruling the phone market The s5 and below have always seemed comparable to other devices but with the release of the s6 they pushed through the barriers of comparability The s7 is jampacked with great features and specs For starters the water resistance is a plus There is no worry when rain is about when eatingdrinking or when swimming That security and peace of mind allows one not to baby their device which is often the very reason they drop it Next the camera is great Pictures always come out crystal clear and resilient bursting with color The camera also has many features The 3d model feature really just hints at what Samsung can do with VR
 The display makes everything so defined Colors pop off the screen as do texts This is helped by the almost bubbled looking screen This is not new however as competition testifies In this regard the display is great but nothing special to Samsung
 Battery life is average I can go from about 630am to 7pm before really needing a charge That is after all day activity Texting social media calls photography and running various apps for work The flagship of the battery life is not how slowly it dies but how fast it charges With a full charge in about an hour you can recharge and be ready to go
 Some other features include all of the customizable applications and inapp shortcuts
 Over all I am very happy with this device It is durable lightweight and sleek as can be It also runs very smoothly easily navigating menus and apps 1010 would recommend Had Samsung 5 for many years no problem nothing but problems with Samsung 7 Ive only had the s7 for a week but I sure do like it Purchased just under two weeks ago This phone is awesome Theres a learning curve when switching from an iPhone But I love it Love my phone easy to use and would recommend it Do not like as much as I thought I would  Screen is too small and print is too small Only had it a week but so far does everything advertised Takes great pictures  Love the easiness of this phone Love it Its fast and easy to use This is a very nice looking phone I love the option to have themes on your phone I hesitated to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge until I viewed it in the store and had an assistant explain its many features I really like the Edge feature as it makes navigating my phone much easier I also like the larger screen as my eyesight is beginning to fade as I reach 70
The only thing I miss from my Galaxy S4 is the ability to go hands free and have all calls done through speakers without having to select speaker on each call
Im not one who HAS to keep up with the new technology but am glad I got the S7 Edge I highly recommend this phone to others Like the phone  Camera isnt very good I love everything about my phone except the day after I the phone out of the box the screen cracked up at the top when my wife was putting in my SD card Samsung nor Verizon would replace the phone Best phone on the market right now Buy it right now Ive always had Samsung phones since my very first smart phone Ive had the S3 S4 Note 3 as well as several Samsung Tablets I recently upgraded from the Note 3 about a month ago It was an adjustment getting used to the smaller screen but the picture quality makes up for that All the apps works super fast and the battery last forever It a bunch of extra features that I always wanted on my Note 3 like the wireless charging and a super bright LED for a flash since I often have to use my phone as a flash light Overall this is an excellent phone and Im glad I made the switch back to the S series phones Great phone awesome screen and camera Perfect size The S7 Edge is a better improvement over the S6 Edge than I had expected The screen is still terrific but the S7 is faster and the edge screen is much more useful I also like having the ability to add space wa card

Im still learning but I think the battery use is improved a good bit too I like the performance and the ability to work with other Samsung devices Wish it had video chat capability like the note 5 Battery seems ok Not sure how everyone is getting 2 days out if it Unless they dont use it Does last longer than my S5 Camera well so far not overly impressed Think my S5 pics are better Seem grainy at any light level Dont like that u cant just touch screen for focus and pic taking like the S5 had Have to focus then take pic Like the 1 touch better Fix Nice phone as in light and compact Feels like im going to break it though Did choose the edge ovr the plain S7 because of battery And supposedly the awesome camera Any tips I just got my new phone 4 days ago  Im still getting used to all that I can do with it  So far I love what it is capable of doing  There are a couple of apps that I wont use so will disable them This phone is awesome I have had a samsung galaxy since the original vibrant The phone works great and has polished look I love how they changed the design of the phone and added back the memory card All the features are great Changed to S7 from Motorola Razr Maxx and the S7 is poorer in signal reception than the Motorola For example I cannot make or receive calls from my desk at work and that was never a problem with the Motorola The Motorola would drop to 3G but the S7 goes to 1X if at all I just really like the way it is easy to use and operate Im absolutely in love with my S7 The extras features and mobility makes me life so much easier Much improved from my S5 Great battery life Highly recommend Its like having two phones in one it knows you  This is by far the best phone I have ever had and to top it off I got the s2 gear that I can use by it self its a phone thats smokes all others Great phone the water resistant capabilities are fantastic I literally was showing it off to my friends and family in the pool and letting it just fall in its crazy how it actually works When you charge the phone it takes no time at all with its fast charging mode The camera looks amazing and the screen is flawless I purchased the galaxy S7 phone 10 days ago and have found it fairly easy to figure out  I am impressed by how much faster response time I have compared to the last two models of Droid that I owned previously jrj I love my new galaxy S7 I love the color and design but my favorite thing is the amazing camera The pictures are amazing Love it so far still learning new things need better product than Samsung S5 got it but email settings I cannot augment to sync all emails to my phone when I am away from home otherwise very good phone upgrade and worth the money S7 is a great device generally but if you replace your sim card it always notifying that the sim is not from the same operator 
Battery life is good heat is accepted even navigating is very easy and fast I love this Samsung 7 Edge phone Android phones are the best I love the new edge feature and can access apps that I use often very quickly I have only had my new phone for 2 12 weeks so I am still learning I went to a class that my carrier had to learn about some of the new additions to this phone compared to my Samsung 4 I love the Upower saving feature that extends the battery life I will continue to support android products because I believe they are the most innovative and they provide me with everything I need They have great customer service and stand behind their products Thanks Samsung for another great phone I like my S7 it is almost the same as the S6 Just have a problem with the texts It sometimes tells me I have one but theres nothing there I had the S5 before and i LOVED it so much Upgraded to the S7 as i heard they fixed all the issues from the S6 and im pretty happy with it Its just like the S5 so no transitioning I love the faster charging with a regular size charger though and im super geeked to try the VR headgear The pictures have great quality and are incredible for photography This is the best phone that I have used
Great quality sound camera and features The battery life is great as well
I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family Nothing but good experience and quality product with Verizon This is a great phone except for some if the physical design features I dropped it once by accident from a height of about a foot and a half abd the back glass shattered Glass on the back of the phone is just bad design Thats why the iPhone 4 design was trashed Otherwise Im on Android which will never be better than iOS I only got the phone cuz I had to and it was not by choice I really love my S7 it is easy to use holds charge longer than my S5 did I put off getting a new phone for years am I sorry I waited  The S7 is so much more that I could have hoped for The galaxy s7 is great i would recommend it because it is quick wayer proof and the features are awesomeIt has a nice pixle density for high definition If I remember it has a nice almond display feature The game tools that came with this phone or amazing and the fact that its waterproof makes it even better I really like this phoneits easy to use and its fastreally great phone Would recommend this to anyone love it great pictures and sound easy to find what I want light weight Just upgraded from the S5 Obvious performance and feature upgrades but still impressed with the speed and efficiency of the S7 I have the Galaxy S7  It is a great cell phone I love that its so easy to use It takes
beautiful pictures I went to the beach today and took some great pictures of the ocean and boats The phone fits great in my pocket  Not too big  Not too small Also  it has a great design 
I just love it Everything about this phone is awesome The only thing that I dnt like is that is gets really hot really quick and turns itself off Other than that everything is perfectBest camera on a phone yet I made the decision to switch from iphone I have had every iphone since they came out But I couldnt be happier with my S7 Edge It has performed as expected at every turn This is my first phone It was easy for me to learn to use Its very user friendly I like the fingerprint password feature The screen size is perfect The help features were very clear and easy to follow for a novice like me I absolutely love this phone it runs flawlessly the battery last for an amazing long time It is so easy to use The best part is how the screen goes to the edges This is a great phone Its slimsleek and very responsive Love how fast it charges when the battery is low Bought my son one for his birthday and I just had to have one for myself I love that the Galaxy S7 has expandable storage That was the one reason that I didnt upgrade until now The Galaxy S6 didnt have any expandable storage Indeed a superior mobile phone at an affordable price There is no phone better than this model of Samsung phone even better than the all of them Quality is unbelievable and durable I love it Previously I had owned a Galaxy s5 and it was the best phone I had ever owned I loved that phone and I didnt want to give it up until I was given the Galaxy s7 that is The s7 is gorgeous The build quality feels even better than the s5 which was dropped several 100 times lol as well as a much classier look As far as tasks you ask Well the s7 is a rocket The processor is beyond fasthe Storage you ask Pretty sure 32g internal along with an SD Memory expansion will do just fine Personally though water resistance is back in the s7 and working as a plumber that is priceless I love samsung products that why it wasmy first choice I havent got a new phone since 3years ago and now that I was able to get new one I choose samsung s7 edge Im planning to get a very good durable case protecter for my phone so I can have it for more time without having to break the screen Cant believe I didnt buy this phone sooner
Apple is overrated I will never buy another Apple product again great product work great This phone is amazing 1st the battery life is unbelievably long lasting the camera is beyond any phone out there Recommend to get a S7 to all my friends I love the gold colorway it is amazing You can personalize this phone to your likings The only thing I would like to be better is the selfie cam The front side is amazing I am very pleased with what I purchased Good job samsung Only had this phone a few days Im completely satisfied Slim case is easy to slip into my purse Nice size is comfortable to hold And I like the pretty gold case I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I will say that this device is great Im visually impaired and when nit was time to upgrade my old phone I opted for the S7 The speech functions are amazing the settings for low vision are great and the clarity and brightness of the colors are spectacular I can only testify to my uses but the S7 has by far exceeded my expectations This phone literally saved my life from my old galaxy s5 this phones screen is so nice and bright and it works so well and fast its amazing  I love all the features it offers its super easy to use and the sleek design feels similar to my old samsung just upgraded This is the best phone Ive had in a long time I am a Big Samsung Fan All the TVs in my Home are Samsung TV s 6 and the last 5 cell phone I had have been Samsung Galaxy phone So I truly Love there product I absolutely love this phone I had the S6 before this one and just traded it in for the edge All the features are perfect and works great And I greatly enjoy the edge screen So easy and handy to have everything right there Ive also gotten it wet in the rain and no problems at all overall a very good cell phone what more can I say The Galaxy S7 is an overall improvement over my Galaxy S5 There are a few features that the 
S5 had that I wish were on this phone such as being able to see my step count from S Health on the lock screen but overall the phone is exceeding expectations I just bought this phone Very durable and I love everything you can do with this phone Big enough to enjoy the screen but not too big or thick to fit in your pocket Its easy to use  The coverage is great  There is some freeze up with games Still so much to explore on it though Beyond happy with itI needed a phone that was water resistant because Im always fishing and I can take photos of my catch easier I like the phone and features hate that it does not have a removable battery and that the battery drains fast The included quick charger is great in spite of it all I would still recommend this device Easy to use fits my hand well great audio outstanding photos and a good price the settings change on their own This phone is for the business oriented person not the average user who only needs to call text email and play games Whats with all the permissions Why would certain 
functions need to record my conversations Why were the calendar highlights taken away Phone gets very hot when just laying on a hard surface Four updates in 5 days My old phone was a S4 mini that phone was much better than this one So what if the camera is clearer This phone will blind someone with how bright the screen is The screen protector that Verizon sells doesnt even cover the entire screen Thanks Every functionapp requests permission to access my phone functions ie contacts photos personal usage at anytime Really Why Nope not interested in all that The connection still kicks rocks Ive had 1G in my status bar That is a shame with their always 4G best 4G this and that Honestly I see why Paul said Bye Awesome userfriendly great apps I had switched over to the Note line when the Note 2 came out but the S3 and S4 were my favorite phones before that I decided to give the S7 Edge a go while I awaited the Note 7 and it is an amazing phone I loved the feel of the Note 5 in my hand and as always the features were amazing I wasnt sure about the Edge screen but I really enjoy it I actually use the Edge features way more than I thought I would and lets face it it is just beautiful to look at 

My wife has a phone from another manufacturer with the same screen size only my Edge with a case on it is way smaller and easier to hold We had friends over the other night and someone got food on my screen I picked it up and ran it under the sink to rinse it off I didnt think anything of it but the reaction in the room was awesome Everyone was like what are you doing I rinsed and wiped the phone off clean Lots of Can I do that with my phone No no you cant Everyone wanted to see the phone then I wont even get into the reaction when I set it on a wireless charger LOL I think I will finally be able to get my wife over to team Samsung and may have converted a few others as well

Bottom line is that this phone is not only beautiful and provides useful features it is fast and the security updates have been very timely Great job Samsung Have alway enjoyed Samsung products Easy to navigate and use I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and its a great phone The only thing that I dont like is sometimea that the screen will lock and then you can not unlock it and you have to do the factory mood restart or factory mood turn off that is the only problem that I have with the phone besides that its a great phone Samsung is really the easy best all of all entries brand I preferred This is the best phone Iver ever had I had another phone and would take lots of pictures with it but when I went to the store and saw this phone and the camera on it I sold my other phone and got the gs7 edge I use this phone for everything and I mean everything Its fast its clear the pictures are amazing I love this phone Samsung out did themselves with this one All I can say is the best phone on the market right now I just got the samsung galaxy s7 2 days ago Total amazing phone features are awesome  Battery life way better than I expected S7 Edge is the best phone I have used in a long time The simplicity of the phone makes it so easy to use and also the design of the phone makes it the best phone out there I love the edge technology because you can easily have information at your finger tips The s7 is an awesome phone battery life is good pictures are excellent I just switched to Android from a Windows phone and raised Samsung has a lot of features that make it easy to learn and use I the speech recognition is much better and the camera takes great photos and has lots of cool editing and drawing features I love this phone I came from a galaxy s5 mini The terrible battery life and poor support by att drove me to get an upgrade After thinking about it for a week or so I finally decided on thebs7 edge I love the fact that it comes with marshmallow and will surely get nougat when it is pushed I got the black model The black looks very sleek and powerful With the home button completely black it helps making the front more uniform The back being almost all black and nothe blueblack like the s6 was makes it look nice upside down The phone is a fingerprint magnet The phone feels great in the hand I usually text with two hands no matter how big the phone is With the front and back being curved it makes it feel very uniform The display has great saturation and is high resolution All of my devices except for my TV and monitor are all 720p Its a huge resolution bump from 720p to 1440p The 2K display looks great being amoled You might lose a bit of pixel density on the edge vs the regular but when the resolution is so high anyway you cant notice at all I can put my face right up to the screen and no pixels are visible Also I turned off always on display I bought a smartwatch so I didnt have to check my phone so often Now thats not saying thats its a useless feature I just hope that samsung puts more features into the night edge and edge features rather than always on I find that I have the night edge clock on all of the time so it lights up the edge for that not part of the display Next thing is the battery The edge has an AMAZING batteryou With the s5 mini I would play 30 min Of games at most and send a few textsx maybe listen to music By the time I got home at 315 or so it would need a charge I took this thing off the quick charger at 9 this morning and it got down to about 15 at 12 am After quick charging it to about 70 I took it off to browse the Internet and google and after maybe an hour on power saving and minimum screen brightness its at 46 at 443 am It can get through a day or more if I dont use it much Next thing is the OS The UX over android marshmallow 601 is great I like the idea of having monthly security updates and software updates for 2 years or so My other galaxy had a ton of att bloat ware that just took up space this has far less bloat ware The one thing I dont like about the OS is the ridiculous amount of storage space it uses The next thing is the cpugpu pack The cpu runs very fast Ive only noticed some slight slowdown Usually on the home and lock screen after a reboot for about 30 seconds Sometimes the UX gets a little leggy but its not bad not like the complete OS crashes that my other phone had Last thing I want to get to is the most important part of this phone the edge display So far I have really liked the edge features I have not had it for very long but I know someone someday is going to ask me about it I feel that its worth the money to get the edge I wish it had more features but I bet software updates will fix that Im ad they didnt get rid of the dock to make the edge the dock like on the note edge Overall this is an excellent smartphone and I would recommend it to almost anyone I have this phone for about 3 weeks and loving it Surfing the Internet is a breeze I use the phone mainly for voice text  surf the Internet GPS watch videos listen to music and Online banking Theres no menu button which is ODD and takes some getting used to Other features are really good  Battery seems to last a solid chunk of time  GPS works better than my previous Samsung This is a amazing device  the camers is incredible the pix are equal in quality of any professional camera costing thousands no more worries about water spills the speakersits unbelievable how much clear sound comes from them and graphics are bold and beautiful I couldnt think of one thing id change about this phone oh Its a great phone too Try it youll love it This is a great phone its fast not oversixed it takes great pictures day or night I love this phone and would recomend it to my friends and family Its also waterproof Only complaint is that I had a hard time finding a case only 1 was available after visiting 3 stores I k ow it looks beautiful But having a phone made of almost completely glass just isnt Kool Looks great But very impractical I got a Pelican case so Im good though love my S7 loved my Note 3  but it was time to retire my friend so I treated myself to the latest and greatest galaxy s7 im a happy girl and my note 3 can rest easy now For me the important qualities of a phone are

 Battery life
 Screen quality 
 Camera
 Size 5 inch screen 

The S7 battery life is above average for a power user like me but as far as screen size and camera quality are concerned the S7 is best bar none 

Finally these core features combined with extras such as water resistance the gaming tweaks advanced theming etc really makes this the best overall package that I could have asked for Every day Im finding new and useful features and loving the device more and more as I use it Some of the most advanced features available feom the Samsung S7 include NFC payment like Samsung Pay which it amazingno mind blowing It has saved me in instances where I have left my wallet at home In addition wireless charging and VR games and entertainment are perks I enjoy often now even though I never though I would use them The camera of course is outstanding I have very little use for a digital SLR camera these days Being an android it is made for voice commands with or without a bluetooth headset making talking and texting safer when driving Not to mention the large screen for viewing my GPS navigation This device goes everywhere with me I use it so much but the battery lasts all day moat days And when it looks low charging it for a short time brings me back to 100 ready for the next round of entertainment communications or recording the most important moments of my life Samsung took all of the positives from the past Galaxy series devices and rolled them into this phone  and eliminated many of the irritating features of the earlier phones Aside from having a issue with the phone restarting itself has happened three times in the four months I have had it I have yet to have a problem with this device I work for a wireless provider and have owned most of the Galaxy series devices and I have yet to find a feature on the Galaxy S7 with which I am not happy I especially love the water resistant component and the expandable memory Miss not having a removable battery but this is definitely not a deal breaker I bought this two weeks ago and I enjoy italot more space on itvery easy to use Bought this phone for my boyfriend and couldnt have selected a better phone Video calling is great quality the phone is so easy to use and overall perfect size This phone is a bit on the expensive side but all the features you get are great I got this phone because of the quality of the cameraand I am not disappointed The quality of the photos is wonderful The reason I didnt give it a great rating is because of the backup feature I have always used an iPhone when you back up and then need to restore the phone is just as you never stopped using it Not so for this one Because of security at work my invalid login attempts were very low The Samsung did not recognize my fingerprint and then my phone was wiped No problem I could just restore Or so I thought Sure my contacts restored but I had to manually redownload the apps and recreate all the folders What a waste of time I even called tech support thinking maybe I was doing something wrong but that wasnt the case I love this phone I have always owned a galaxy phone started with an S2 then went to an S4 S5 an now the S7 They just get better and better each time I love how now you can change the whole theme of the phone And you can do multiple things at a time on it I could never own any other brand or type of phone Nothing can make me part ways from galaxy I got the Edge for myself and the S7 for my wife almost same time and I believe the s7 is a better option it has all the features excluding the edge options which I dont use and smaller more compact package 
In general the phone performs good without any issues the inconvenience of the edged sides is a little bit compensated by the very attractive design the edge options are not very usefull for me This phone is by far the best yet Super fast beautifully designed and balanced display Ive owned several Samsung Galaxies and the S7 Edge is a combination of everything Samsung has done right over the years Wow this phone is awesome I love the features and the new Droid operating system I was still limping along on my S3 because I didnt want the hassle of reinstalling my apps etc which I had to do in the past I was pleasantly surprised when the migration from my S3 to the S7 was such a snap

I also ordered the wireless charger awesome The connection on my old S3 would fall out because of inserting it multiple times to charge Now I just lay it on top of the wireless and its a nobrainer I like the fact I can hit the home button to start the camera It makes it a snap to take pictures

The display is so vivid and the sound is so much better I can actually hear my text message indicator go off in the other room Its much louder now if I want to set it there

I havent tested the water resistant feature yet  I figure I will get the chance at some point 

Anyway I highly recommend this phone Just like any other samsung phone but better Theyve done a great job of keeping all the great stuff and upgrading those not so great features I still dont know why they took away the removable battery Overall a very solid phone with a great battery life I bought it last week and love it love it Better than any android Ive ever owned and better than any iPhone Ive ever owned It is truly the most refined Android phone period I like my new phone and will probably like it more once I discover all it can do The only part I didnt like was my stupidity and forgetting my password so I had to wait 24 hours to access my phone due to factory reset But like I said it was my fault I love it I love my fone is does more than one task at a time I wouldnt have it no other way Before buying this phone I had the S5 and it was starting to get slow and laggy so I decided to upgrade Ive had this phone for about a month now and Im still finding new features on it Its very quick and can handle a lot of apps very well The camera is also very good and has a lot of cool features as well To put it simply this phone is great in all aspects Performance and features are outstanding Switched from a Moto X and noticed that the performance is far better Very impressed Navigating the various features feels very natural This is by far the most useful phone I have ever had Ive had my Galaxy S7 for about a month now  I love it I havent had any problems out of it I would buy it again Love the phone it is small enough for me and easy to use I am a loyal Samsung user I totally recommend the phone to anyone I traded in my Galaxy Note 2 for this phone as soon as my contract was up So far the phone it works great and Ive had excellent photos Definitely recommend this phone Most in pressed with Data Shared speed With Samsung Smart TV operations very easy to operate together and programing Awesome device very easy to operate functional amazing color easy to set up I was using an LG G3 it was a nice phone however this Galaxy S7 is better I like the additon of a flashlight built into the phone without downloading an app The camera is phenomenal the battery holds a good long charge Some apps use more battery than others but for the most part its a good battery The only thing I would change on this phone is the ability to tap the screen to wake it up It was a nice feature on the LG and it would make this phone perfect for me Also a simpler way to screen shot such as one button or tapping the screen would be nice Pushing 2 buttons is difficult for me only having one hand and swiping the screen sometimes makes the page move before it screen shots All in all this is a very good phone So far I love everything about this phone I told my wife that after the S5 I wouldnt need another phone but then the S7 Edge came out and had to have it Not only does this phone look great but it works great Always choose Samsung The best Always up to date Ive been an iPhone person for a very long time 
I was extremely cautious with my purchase of the Galaxy s7 so far Im definitely diggin the much better camera I enjoy how its easy to use Ive told all my friends that are ready for upgrades to consider this cellular device No big deal breakers on the Cons list 
For a water resistant phone they are not friends Very fragile Get A Case Immediately After being loyal to Samsung from the very first S model through the S5 Id switched over to the iPhone because I loved my iPad This was ultimately my year long mistake I had to settle for FINALLY out of desperation I added a line to my ATT account for the S7 edge Once again Im back to happiness and Ill never stray from Samsung again Thank you Samsung for making my life so wonderful Love my new phone it a tab bigger than the 6 My summer has been full of fun due to the idea i can capture my family water play without worry of water damage Im super clumsy so a great durable phone like the S7 is perfect for me I have 2 Samsung tvs my s7 connects so easily to show my pics and videos Its great Great upgradeloving the features Ive had iPhones and Android phones through the years and have had every galaxy phone since the 4 just about and none of them compare to the S7 edge It feels great in your hand it looks super cool and smooth I get compliments all the time about just how cool it looks Performance wise not once have I been doing anything whether its the internet playing a game watching netflix or whatever it may be that I have wished it was going faster Best phone on the market right now hands down Ive had my S7 Edge for a few weeks now The curved screen takes a little getting used to but once you do its amazing Its probably the most vivid screen Ive ever had in a phone The performance is top notch I havent noticed any issues with anything slowing down or timeouts Im on the phone constantly and the battery will last me most of the day which is strong All in all I couldnt be happier with the phone GREAT PHONE Just exactly what I wanted The representative was very knowledgeable Knew just what I wanted I am very pleased with the S7 The camera is great and the screen is gorgeous Battery life is much improved over my S4 and the processor is zippy It handles my larger games just fine I do miss the removable battery but they are all going that direction This phone works amazingly The only problem I run into is accidently pressing on the edge when watching a video and bringing up the pauseplay button Just bought it love it Great phone Easily able to maneuver it and the instructions cover all I also like that when you first get your phone there is a navigation Guide in each section to better explain what the feature is Theres also different fonts and colors that we can chose from Pictures are more crispier and its a much faster phone Im absolutely happy about this phone The quality and durability this phone contains is worth purchasing The battery life is also a big plus as I am a heavy user for social media and using the cameras I do wish the front camera had better quality but its still overall an amazing phone I definitely recommend to those to purchase this model  Only a week old and it is what I wanted I sometimes have to remind myself that this is not my S5 Easy transition with the Samsung mover app Had the phone for a little over a month Upgraded from the S3 Night and day difference Especially
with regards to the camera The clarity of the audio seems to be a lot better too Performs at least better than I expected Cant compare to I Phone as Ive not had an I Phone Our service is thru ATT and at times that is a little frustrating I also purchased the Samsung desk top Fast Charger and that is as handy as a shirt pocket Overall the Samsung products are tops in our situation I had a galaxy 5 and loved it Then it was stolen I didnt want to purchase a new phone but Im glad I did Galaxy S7 edge has anything you could ask for Lots of great features with multiple screens The battery last three times longer then my last phone and its a quick charge Incredible pictures with brilliant colors I could be happier I have recently moved up from a baseline Galaxy S4 to the baseline Galaxy S7 The obvious first improvement is moving from 16 Gb to 32 Gb An improved camera is one of the main improvements but I feel the best change is the sturdier housing now allowing for more resistance to shock and water While it is still not considered waterPROOF the resistance is improved and you can now make a call in a rainstorm without worrying about voiding your warranty Sounds infantile but HAS happened Whats next Should be interesting to see Excellent tool when used in conjunction with the Samsung Oculus VR enhancement I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S4 Before I made my decision I did a lot of comparisons I knew what I didnt want 
So far I love the ease of using the New Samsung Galaxy S7 I have used samsung galaxy phones since the S5 I also use for work an iPhone and until last month a Lumia the Samsung Galaxy S7 is amazing I get more than a day of battery power if I dont charge during the day the fast charge makes it very quick to reload back to a full 100 in just minutes I stopped worrying about power on my phone a while back

At first I was concerned about the camera going to 12 mp from 16 mp on the S6 but this one is definitely better much faster and focuses instantly

A great addition is the micro SD slot welcome back storage

Overall a great great phone I am a sales associate with ATT and I sell more of these phones than I do any other brand I was an iPhone users for the longest time until I started playing with the edge I love the features and additional memory option The camera is absolutely amazing and take the best pictures I tell everyone about this phone and always recommend it when asked which phone I prefer more Samsung makes great products and I would highly recommend all of the products to any of my customers too fragile and backside is too slick as in example the back side from the Samsung Galaxie five was perfect plasticrubber like you could place it on your leg while driving and would not fall from it this is not possible I purchased this phone from Costco last week  Ive really enjoyed it  Very Fast and reliable Switched from an IPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S7edge and glad I did After having the S7edge for a month now would never go back The waterproofing feature and better camera wireless charging makes it stand out from the IPhone The phone is an absolutely beauty The 55 inch display is easily handled with no problems Overall the best phone on the market A little pricey but worth every penny Ive only had it a week so Im still trying to get familiar with the features but very easy to use I bought this a week ago and I like it I love this phone great camera features and the edge works great Ive only had the phone for a couple of weeks and am impressed with the capabilities it has over my previous one Best phone ever great camera very fast long lasting battery My samsung galaxy s7 is the the second galaxy i have ever had It is the best phone i ever had and works amazingly I love the features in it and all the customization in it I have bought the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge it is by far the best smartphone Ive ever owned with this phone I can multitasklive chat with friends play games at lightning fast speeds and still have 50 percent battery life at the end of the day I am a sanitation worker and this phone keeps track of all of my steps throughout the day can measure stress spo2 and even heart rateI am rating this five stars because this Phone has all of the features I have been looking for for a long time nowI will recommend to all of my friends incredible performance great camera battery life is as great as any other feature simply The Next Big Thing D Had this phone for two wks and if you get this get the gear vr too amazing excellent battery and call clarity Ive had this phone for a week now and am enjoying it although without a case it is a little hard to hold onto without tapping the sides of the screen and it is slimmer and rounder than my s5 no worries since ill be buying a case for it love the double tap on the home button to quick open the camera love the removable hidden storage Samsung included everything you needed to transfer everything from your old phone to this one and included the tool to open the hidden sd slot the camera has a pro mode and allows you to shoot in RAW which is wonderful for when I forget my camera at home Previously owned an iphone4 was nervous getting such an upgrade  Im glad I did The images are crisp great camera and the battery seems to be lasting longer  I own a Samsung tablet so switching to the android wasnt too hard understanding the phone settings were differentvery different than the iphone4 Nice though and much faster Easy transition from my S6 I thought it would be more durable Spouse had her S7 in her purse and screen cracked somehow Ive had this phone only a week and absolutely love it Great features like auto connection via Bluetooth so it knows when youre driving and sends an automatic reply message to those texting you that youre driving and will contact them later Clarity of screen and sounds is amazing Lightweight and slim design is great too Battery life has about 50 leftafter a normal days use accessing social media Pandora news sites etc Loving the updated look and new apps Bought phone a week ago and am very happy with it I really like the edge and the design of samsung galaxy s7 edge Its is better than iphone because it will slip through your hands but samsung galaxy s7 edge wont I thought since this phone was almost a year old it would have been perfected by now Im not pleased with the battery life and I cant get a spare like I have in the past  However the bigger issue is the fact I cant sync up to the many Bluetooth devices in our home That is very disappointing Fix this phone Love this phone Have only had it a week but the best phone Ive ever had The phone is a big improvement from the S5  The Android settings are a challenge to get all working the way I would like  I think some of the explanations of the settings could be written in better language so all could understand them  A terms dictionary might help  When I was was working my company gave us a course in writing so all audiences could understand what you were writing in plain language  That is what is needed here I have only had this phone for a week and the battery  does not hold charge even when I hardly use it Very fast and reliable phone Only complaint is the excessive preloaded Verizon software I bought this phone to replace a phone whos battery was overheating and so far I liked my other phone better Its okay  Not many changes from my old phone My calendar did not transfer to my new phone  My voice fades in and out so I have to go back to the Verizon store and get another one which will take a long time  My Words With Friends app did not transfer over so if I download the app again I lose all current games and scores  Many of my apps did not transfer over Ive had my phone for a Lil while and I love it I would recommend this phone to anyone Excellent phone well worth the money It has many good features EXCEPT download of iTunes has been impossible so far  Ill keep trying but it shouldnt be that way  Just too hard  Need a workaround that works I bought this about  a week ago and i love it I absolutely love my Galaxy S7 I have been a loyal user for many years and this upgrade stays right on par with my huge expectations of Samsung 
For me it is very user friendly and I was able to move my data from the S4 to my S7 with no problems and was exceptionally fast and accurate 
The S7 is a bit heavier then the S4 but not enough to make a huge difference or to be dissatisfied with the S7 
My main complaints are the amount of preinstalled apps that come with the phone and the built in battery I like the ability to swap out a battery when Im on the run so I was disappointed to learn the S7 did not have this option 
The sound and picture are great as i have come to expect and love from Samsung The speed and quality of the phone are just as exceptional I like that this phone has large viewing screen as my old flip phone didnt  I know once I get used to the new features I will be very happy with them its just getting use to the S7 vs the flip phone that I had had for 8 years  It will take a little while for the change to be comfortable or automatic   Everyone around me has these phones and loves them so I know that in a short time I will also Beautifully crafted with live I couldnt ask for a better phone Samsung is approaching technological perfection with the galaxy s7 I havent had any problems with the battery like Ive read on other comments but Im also using power saving mode so I bought this phone about a week ago and the battery has been junk since day 2 i have tocharge it at least twice a day from completely dead and the screen keeps freezing or doesnt respond like it should Hate the phone Love the new features  product meets all my expectations Just got it 3 days ago love it I have had it for a week as the title  states it is a good  basic smartphone Others in my family always have better reception than I do Recently purchased still getting used to it very easy to usehas more features than i will ever need I bought this phone a week ago and love all the new features  It was very easy to setup and I like discovering all the new things that it can do Purchased this phone a week ago This is my third phone in the Galaxy series As always Samsung delivers a quality product BIG fan of this phone its still easy to use with great improvements We got 2 Samsung Galaxy 7s smartphoneso to replace 2 Galaxy 5s smartphones We have  had them for about a week nice phones I love the color functions and customization options Been on the fence on getting an iPhone but Im glad I didnt follow the crowd I bought this phone about a month ago and for the most part I am happy with it but its hard to believe an updated phone doesnt have software that supports the simplest thing as being able to use individual contact message tones that is disappointing to me I just got this a short time ago and I am still learning the features  I think there are a lot of wellthoughtout upgrades  I love the lowlight camera Love it
Very easy to use Was deciding whether or  not to get an iPhone which I did not want at all so glad I stayed with Samsung S7 performs plenty of other useful functions besides having an amazing camera Love the charger base and the camera Bought the phone a week ago works good has a really great camera Battery life sucks in standby its fine but once you start using anything it dies down real quick Everything else about the phone itself is great nice phone nice to be water proof easy to use nice to have wireless charging built in CON no battery change by owner Phone gets hot fast and battery dies much quicker than my older galaxies Wish it had a removable battery Other than that great phone and awesome pics I love this phone besides the screen overlay setting that doesnt allow anything to work together I have a bank app for my bank and the camera cant function for the mobile deposit setting in the app because of the screen overlay setting Bought this phone a week ago and am really happy so far I am having some problems with it My s5 was much faster I dont know if its all the bloat ware  but phone exchange runs slow  Great phone love it  Amazed at all it c a new do Ok phone got talked into it since the store didnt really have anything else I upgraded from an S5 and the phones are very similar  For some reason however the calendar on the new phone is very difficult  Although my phone is set up for Eastern time zone the preset time zone for notifications was Korean So all notifications were a day earlier  The phone also made every event one hour later than input I had the S5 prior to this I like the upgrades This has everything i could possibly want in a smart phone  and then some  every feature it has is just more than need be and is perfect Its a great phone other than u can only use it for a few min No Internet time or gaming time due to it get too hot to even hold I have been using my new Galaxy s7 for several days and am very impressed with it It is an excellent quality phone with a great camera Both great phones Turbo 2 is good for durability but lacks user friendly features like the S7 Ive been using this phone and the camera throughout my vacation in the Caribbean and neither has let me down Beautiful pictures and videos This phone new features are awesome I upgraded from the s4  Very disappointed that the menu button on the lower left is gone and replaced with close all windows on the home screen  Its useless for me  Ive adapted to the changes on the s7  Was able to personalize the phone the way I like it  If I need help I just Google and get my answer  I always had a problem printing with the s4 but the s7 prints from my wifi printer without a problem The photos I take seem to be more  vibrant in color  The battery charge lasts a little longer  Im not a gamer and I dont stream movies on the phone so I cant tell you if the charge lasts longer in that respect  All in all if you like the Galaxy S series I would recommend upgrading to the s7 Cant do a lot with it get rid of some of the group apps like googleverzion and samsungpeople should be able to downtown there own appsand not be forced to have preinstalled apps Even without playing games and just using the phone for texting calls and music the battery barely last through the day Whereas the Samsung Galaxy s4 didnt drop a single call in years my brand new s7 drops almost every single call I makereceive from home Hadnt planned on upgrading from my Galaxy S5 but had to change providers and had to buy a new phone  I love it  Samsung makes everything pretty darn easy  Happy camper here Ive had the phone about 2 weeks and Im still learning its capabilities but from what Ive seen and done so far Im very glad I made the purchase I love Samsung products Ive had many but I really love this phone Light slim and fast with the return of the expandable memory was the clincher for me The camera performance is amazing too 

Hoping to get a Gear S2 watch or a Gear Fit2 to go with it I love the updated features Great camera HD voice and sleek design I BROUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE SAMSUNG HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT PHONE FOR ME I love it still learning to use it Ive had the S7 for just over a week and in my limited use Ive found it most enjoyable The screen is incredibly sharp and everything works with logical ease This phone is amazing I find myself using it just about everyday since picking it up and have yet to run into any problems with it It is fast and has a great battery life and when it does get low it charges very quickly after plug in I love this phone because I can make it mine  it downloads really fast  it comes with the themes on it just download what you like more crisp clear pics than other phones wouldnt want any other phone even if they were free Great phone Pretty similar to the galaxy s6 edge but I still love the phone Too hard to figure out that feature changeS Love my Samsung S7 edge I had the S5 before this The size the feel in my hand easy to use and very customizable Love it love it I have the 32GB Black Onyx S7 Previously I had the S6 Edge and both are seamless in terms of performance and design One of the many features of the S7 thats better than the S6 model if its expandable memory which I love since I download a lot of videos take videos and take pictures Another thing is the response time of the touch sensors despite when using it underwater where in you can mostly just take pictures and such All the same its an amazing phone and durable too Id recommend it to any of my friends unfortunately they are Apple people so I couldnt convince them otherwise In all though and in my opinion it is the best model and company out there among the top smart phone companies After reading many reviews I was really looking forward to getting this phone  Photos up close are sharp and beautiful but at a distance they are out of focus  There also seems to be a delay when not up close with perfect bright lighting between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken  Many functions seem very complicated like just getting the photos from the device to the computer  It is SO easy with every other device I have  With others you just plug in the USB cord and the computer recognizes it just as though it were a jump drive  I still havent figured out how to easily do it with the Samsung Galaxy S7  I tried it with the Google Drive and that was a disaster  It didnt download all the pictures just some  And if there were pictures taken with the burst mode it only downloaded one of the photos of the group  Everything else has also been complicated to figure out  Ive only had the phone for about a week so Im not sure if Ill be able to learn everything or give up and get something else Had the phone for about a month and havent found a thing which I dislike about it Like how fast it charges Seems to use more battery juice than previous phone Start at 98 AM and am at 28 by 4PM Dont stream video Just checkin on email messages and FB Maps if needed  Love the photo quality but still not figured out how to see the photos in Gallery App Only had this phone a few weeks and I absolutely love it Pictures are so crisp and clean and it works so fast Not happy with the service and want out of my contract I have had the phone for about a week now and I find I really like itthis is only my second smart phone so I was very hesitant to try itI love it so easy to use has great features  I am very pleased Trying to figure out some apps and location  Overall Im happy with the Matteson Illinois reps That solve dilemmas easily Great rear 12mp camera pretty good front facing camera loving the gold sleek frame and the sound quality is amazing Only disappointment was the sizewish the phone was a little bit bigger The fast charging the approximate time of fully charge was more accurate And would like a notifications when the phone is completely charged it just shows red light from when you plug it in even when its at 100 or just shuts off no green light Speak is not that strong But other then that had the phone just about 2 weeks and like it would recommend it Went from s5 to s7very happy with this upgrade Keeps just needing to update everything I dont feel it should if its new 3 the first week I replace it from my Samsung S5and I am happy for it Replaced a Samsung that would no longer charge I updated from an S4  It was so easy to learn and set up That pretty much says it The screen already has a Crack in It I have no idea how this happened I have not dropped this phone 1 time Taking it in today I had a Motorola X and another Samsung phone before that never ever had a Crack in either phones This is the most expensive phone I have ever had and in a week the screen gets a Crack 5 stars I had a S5 and the features are much better Camara is excellent The finger print recognition works 100 better use it all the time now Enjoying new phone and Android The Galaxy 7 phone is an excellent phone and has been trouble free for me It even works with my original Gear watch which was something I did not expect Camera GPS phone and other expected features are great I am very happy with this purchase ATT had a great plan that made it VERY affordable I have always been an iphone user since the first iphone I have finally gave up on many minor malfunctions of the iphone that I finally decided to switch to an Andriod mainly due to the camera I love it and I am so glad I switched The size was holding me back but I am slowly getting used to a bigger phone size The quality of the pictures are worth the switch and it did not disappoint me with all the apps and comparability it offers I did not fall short of the iphone at all This phone has an awesome camera with tons of options to control picture quality or one can simply go with the automatic settings for great pictures Fast and easy to use great features screen size is good but phone is not too big to use with one hand I am in love with the sleek design of this device I get compliments weekly The functionality is very intuitive and is adaptable to anyone looking for a smartphone beginner and novice alike Looking forward to seeing what Samsung comes up with next I was nervous to switch because I was so used to my s5 but the transition was easy Its not against the phone but galaxy has been missing a feature I miss from my galaxy s3  The car mode where you can talk to your phone while driving send messages text etc This phone is amazing glad I bought this phone
I also love the fast charge This is the fourth Samsung phone that Ive owned my last phone was the Galaxy S4 Im very happy with the S7 it fits all of my needs Its intuitive and very easy to work with Its a great device I love my Samsung Galaxy 7S Takes very good pictures and easy to use I bought an aftermarket case for my phone as I was concerned about dropping it 
Thats a lot of money not to protect 

with the case I find that the phone is a little unforgiving for instance the notification bar at the top has been shrunk to a much smaller space than it used to be on my old Galaxy 5 I have to fight with the phone to get it to bring up the drop down menu to review pending notifications 

also in the quick buttons the default order of the buttons while probably perfectly fine for most it took me a bit of time to find the embedded flashlight I had to rearrange the tiles in order to get the flashlight to show as one of the first items in the list I did this because I find the flashlight feature of any phone to be extremely helpful 

On the positive side GREAT SOUND  I am hearing impaired and the phone speaker is great I can hear phone calls easy and when I am playing music I no longer have to attach the phone to an external set of speakers I can enjoy the music as is Easily personalized incredible storage perfect size for my hands an overall great cell phone that does much more than most I love the built in S Health app I am a senior citizen and while I love the new things in electronics that make life so easy wonderful and exciting Ivery found that using these new fangled wonders can be mindboggling
I loved my Galaxy S5 and really love my brand new Galaxy S7 Its so easy to navigate and very userfriendly Even for an old fogey like myself
Its opening worlds of exciting new adventures and its so helpful with my every day life Thank you once again Samsung upgraded from s6 to s7 happy with the phoneperformance Apps and pages load almost instantly Screen is amazingly crisp and the colors are perfect Great camera Great features nice design and an upgraded camera have me not regretting my choice of this phone Phone lives up to hype Only thing stopping me from rating it excellent all around is the drain downloaded apps seem to have on the battery life Of course that may be the case with many phones and should not be seen as a reason not to buy i really enjoy the phone but samsung should make it completely waterproof I love this phone its very easy to use  My only complaint about it is the case I got one of the charging cases its convenient but not great for someone who is clumsy I dropped my phone in the parking lot the day after I got it the case flew off in separate directions and didnt protect my phone at all Seems like the same phone as my s5 Wish I could return or swap Good battery long all day longvery handy and cobfortable to use it I love everything about the samsung 7 Especially the camera One of the best upgrades that I have done Best phone on the market Had it only for a couple of weeks but love it I love my Gold S7 2 of my friends have bought the same phone because they loved mine sooooo much I had a note 4 and thought there was not a better phone but the 7 edge is great it takes amazing pictures the quality is awesome and I can do things on this phone that I couldnt do on the note I love the edge screen other so much fun 
I would recommend this product to everyone 100 Favorite phone of all time Features are great Design is vabulous Performance is amazing Function keys nonresponsive now that i have all of my normal apps running i find this easier to switch between apps and the speed is great Met expectations Im satisfied I got this phone a week ago and upgraded from my galaxy s5 and it is so much better I was in dire need of an upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S4 and this phone didnt disappoint Many new features and very quick response time I havent learned all of the features but I like what Ive seen so far This is a fantastic phone Impressive battery life Only thing I would change is to not give it a glass back Didnt need and upgrade but husband thought hr was being swee  Smaller screen battery saver too restrictive but if I dont use it battery life sucks Great Phone for a reasonable Price I bought this phone and I am older and I dont understand a lot of options  I dont like a book does not come with it and i have to take time to figure out online how to find what I want Not only does this device have amazing battery life which is a first for android phones in general The camera is phenomenal great modes in which you can transition to like the video collage mode is my favorite The edge panel makes it much easier to gain quick access to apps and contacts The best part about this device is even after downloading apps the phone does not freeze and never need to power cycle We traded another smartphone for the Galaxy7 We were very dissatisfied with the other companys service and would never recommend their products to anyone Everything is much easier to operate with the Samsung Especially for my wife and me who are in our eighties My wife would hardly use her other smartphone but now she has the Galaxy with her all the time I like the phone It is lightweight and durable Waterproof is also a good thing Only thing is the screen is smaller than I would like it to be but thats only cuz I came from having a note 4 Overall though this is a great phone I have had Android smartphones from several major makers but this was my first Samsung Since ATT no longer had an offering from my previous manufacturer I checked out this Samsung Galaxy S7 pulled the trigger on it and so far I am loving it Ive had it about a month

The performance of the phone is snappier even though it is of reasonably close specifications to the phone I had immediately prior I love the idea of the water resistance and Gorilla Glass 4 as a nice bit of insurance so to speak

I miss the voice app of the previous phone as S Voice isnt quite as globally integrated but its still using a Google backend for recognition and launching most tasks so its mainly a matter of the launching and the fact that the headset isnt relaying the launch command like the previous phone

The display is beautiful and bright I have the brightness set to about 50 and its fine in all but the brightest outdoor conditions It can do some automatic adjustments too but I found the default brightness indoors a little dim but that was an easy slider adjustment right in the basic settings

Im still figuring out battery usage It seems to drop relatively fast in the beginning of the day and then level off I have only had one time so far where it didnt make it through a normal days usage

All in all Im pretty happy the Samsung S7 feels good easy to navigate and has all the features i was looking for Love this phone I bought this a few weeks ago and find the changes mostly easily to transition  The biggest complaint  issue I have with the newest Samsung is they have taken the frequent callers option on the home screen away  It is now more steps to get to them It is easy to use ad I keep finding new features everyd
1 crystal clear screen and pictures easy to use very fast with LOADS of memory  only problem is Verizon wireless blocks some functionality smart manager which competitors do not Ive only had this phone for a few weeks I like it so far I bought this for the camera and waterproof features I am so happy to no longer be using a Windows based phone that anything was an improvement However I am really impressed by the ease of set up accessibility of apps and settings  I am also happy to be able to use Chrome to search and have a huge variety of vetted apps to download  Wonderful product had this phone for 1 week now adjusted to it very easily from a windows phone Screen is not durable and I have gorilla glass and a tempered glass on it
Screen sensitivity is very high and even if I am holding my phone in my hand the screen is responding to opening or selecting items I have had a Samsung 3 for years and needed an upgrade  Knew I wanted to stay with Samsung so I got the Galaxy S7  It is very different from the one I had  It will do a lot more than I need it to do  The only issue I have is that an update loaded and I did not know for almost a whole day that I could not receive incoming calls  I was getting text but when I went to make a call it would not let me  I turned the phone off and when it rebooted all was well The phone works much faster and has some new features that are really cool  The camera is even better and it was good before  The colors are terrific  Since it is similar it was much easier to transition and most of the apps transferred directly over  So much easier than previous phones I just got this phone one week ago and I LOVE IT  It has so many terrific features that it will take a while to go through all of them and Im looking forward to it Such a nice upgrade over my S4 galaxy More and better features better front and rear facing cameras and much better battery life Love the camera and display The transition from Galaxy S6 was amazingly simple using the back to back link thing Really happy with purchase I have been a Galaxy phone user forever I truly love everything about the S7 I would tell anyone that Galaxy is the way to go when buying a cell phone I loved my S3 and really did not expect much difference when I bought my S7 I was pleasantly surprisedFirst of all  I was amazed at how much faster it wasI also initially though that with all the added features that it would take quite a while to get used to the phone and learn the new features I was pleasantly surprised at how east it was to operate Im a senior citizen and fall under the statement that you cant teach an old dog new tricks you all managed to discredit that myth because this old dog caught on really fast Thanks for engineering such a great phone Great screen love the camera and the way the phone feels in my hand The slow motion feature is amazing So I checked several online comparisons and this phone kept coming in on top of the best phones 2016 lists  So far it doesnt disappoint I enjoy the phone  I am an Apple guy but I use this phone for work  Just had it a few weeks but it is easy to work so far I replaced a Samsung Galaxy S5 with this phone Love the camera as it takes awesome pics and you can edit your pics with the phone The only thing that could be improved is the battery life I upgraded from the galaxy 5 Im not happy with the 3g i get in my house  Its the same service just a new phone  icant get clear calls in my house  I had Verizon change the SD card but it didnt help My husband phone is doing the same thing  It may have something to do with being water proof I wish i would have kept my 5 I finally got my 58 yr old husband to upgrade from his oldschool flip phone Terry has absolutely no knowledge of how to use internet or electronic devices this includes countertop appliances they are too mind boggling for him His epilepsy limits his memory but his new phone has him enjoying the internet so much his enthusiasm is enjoyable to watch The Samsung 7 has been so easy for me to teach him how to use and along with voice commands easy for him to use As my husbands Caregiver I want to say Thank you Samsung this device has made my daily life easier and I love watching and listening to the enjoyment  laughter from my husband when he accomplishes something with his phone things many of us take for granted Im not saying this is the best phone for his needs but I tell you what its been perfect so far I have had a number of Samsung devices starting with the S3 then the Note Most recently my company changed carriers so I got the S6 which is a great phone Seeing as I had an old S3 I decided it was time to upgrade so I went for the latest and greatest the S7

It has a very sleak design Easy to hold and use with one hand if need I like the larger screen and the colors and screen quality are fantastic
The biggest thing for me is that the memory can be upgraded by adding a larger capacity micro SD storage card

Its water resistant so dropping it in a puddle on a rainy day or in the sink wont destroy it 

I purchased the phone with cash and not on a plan and I believe it was well worth the money Good phone easy to use better than the iphones I love the fingerprint security works better than I expected it to  I love the Samsung Pay which was not available on the S5  Waterproof is nice even though I havent tested that  I dont like the fact that I cant turn up the volume without the juvenile reminder that raising the volume can damage my ears  I also havent noticed a marked increase in battery life over the S5 as was promised Security provided through finger print is very vital feature Camera clarity is really very awesome Accessibility of important features in edge is very time saving factor for users This device is amazing Its blazing fast and has an amazing battery Its also extremely powerful and has an amazing screen I dont have root on it but due to the speed I wont for a long while Having taken such a larger step in upgrade the learning curve has been steeper for me than Im sure it has been for many others There are some differences from the S3 to the S7 but nothing that I have not been able to figure out Most have been that my S3 had been set up 4 years ago and I had forgotten how to do a few of them

Love the crispness of the new screen and the expandable memory which was the reason I chose the S3 way back when Hate that the phone is now sealed and I am tethered to a charger I understand the reason but it doesnt mean I have to like it I use to carry 3 extra batteries for my S3 when I travelled and never once found myself having to charge my phone even during multi delays in numerous airports My favorite feature is the cameravideo quality I am a musician and spend time in low light bars with friends and fans Ive recorded video of bands performing and the sound and video quality is fantastic Also when taking selfies the photos are clear and just as good if its forward facing I am a Samsung person all the waySo I wasnt disappointed when I got my S7 at all It felt a little strange going back down to a smaller size phone from my S6 edge plus But once i put them side by side there really isnt that much of a difference I also like the fact that I can put a memory card in this phone Putting on a screen protector and a different case will be a lot easier than my S6 edge plus Thanks Samsung Some of the features I like the best are the longer battery life and the better resolution selfie pictures I have been using Samsung phones for many years I have very little complaints overall I will stay with the Samsung Galaxy S phones as long as they keep making them Bought my S7 about a week ago feels very similar to my old S5 The camera is awesome and I would have given it 5 stars but reception isnt very good on it  Signal drops a lot even when connecting to my home WiFi network for Internet access  Happy with the other features though Great Technology which I like One week in and all is well so far Purchased the phone online and did the backupsyncing myself with a little bit of research Runs games just great although the back of the phone does get very hot sometimes Great quality  camera Had a galaxy s6 and unfortunately broke it Loved the phone so much I immediately bought the s7 My whole family has always been iPhone people Once I made the jump 5 years ago I would never go back I enjoy teasing them that they are paying for old tech that I had years before them with my galaxy Features are great and the phone is easy to use So happy I can now video my daughter learning to swim underwater and share these moments with my friends and family Samsung pay has saved me so many times I installed it on my phone same day I got it Thank you for making a quality product I feel like I am paying for a amazing tech and not trendy marketing Samsung removed the ir blaster so no more universal remote It is not very sensitive on the curverd edges which is good for handling the phone but bad for buttons that hang over on to the edge Battery life seems to be good enough for me with some power intensive options turned on I dont know why but I misspell more words on the new keyboard I shouldnt since I can make it bigger now Waterproof feature works good and it wont let the phone charge until the usb port is dry I acquired my S7 as the result of a crash  of my S6 screen into a mosaic when dropped during one of my ambulance rides 10 days ago I am so glad to have incredible battery life  Theres no comparison to the S6 Very Nice and  neat phone Seems to work well for me I bought it a week ago and it has been great Ive been a Galaxy users since the S3 This S7 Edge is amazing great job on the build quality and the experience as a whole Love your phones and always recommend them to overs as the best phone to get By far the sleekest sexiest most mecanically functional of the galaxy series I have ever owned another reason I will forever be a Galaxy S series owner Thank you Samsung for yet another amazing product I like the way this phone works and it is easy to use It is a lot faster than my last phone and the screen is clearer making it easier to see Also the touch screen is a lot more sensitive than last phone If you buy one you definitely need to get a case for it as the back will crack like glass if it is dropped Love the phone Some calls are not so clear Some calls from friends wont connect at all Not sure if the phone Verizon service Its the best feeling phone Ive ever held Its the most comfortable design I honestly never thought I needed the edge screen until I actually got the phone and started using the edge screen features No complaints so far I have been waiting to get a phone and when I got this I was so happy Moved from an s5to an s7 Glad they put the micro sd slot back but miss the changeable battery though early battery life has been good Nice size quality camera audio just adequate Miss old music app Google music is overly complicated when I just want to listen from sd card but good for podcasts Ive only had this phone for two weeks but so far it works well As configured by Verizon with no apps installed I got 8 hours of a full charge on a moderate use day  After turning off all the new features installing my old apps the battery life still cant match my previous 4 year old Droid Max  Its at low battery at 12 hours on an average use day   Inexcusable that a phone cant make it a full day with moderate use  The design performance and features are all irrelevant when you cant use them due to a poor battery  Im checking into the restocking fee and will return if its reasonable Ive had this new phone for about 2 weeks and   I absolutely love it I switched from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Its was easy to switch of course Im so happy with my decision Ive had it a week I wish I would have never sent my other one in I really like the Samsung Edge Sometimes while driving I find the edge irritating when I am using maps or Mapquest Then the edge activates if I accidentally touch it I have a screen protector on and the case I have keeps bubbling because it pushes against the screen protector It is like I have to choose either a screen protector or a phone case Arguably the best phone I ever had Has all the functions I need and performance is excellent I have had several smart phones the last 5 or 7 years or so but this phone is by far the best I like the features that this phone has such as Samsung payetc I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new smart phone Great battery life wonderful sound quality wonderful resolution and the transition to this phone was simple I love the edge technology and accessibility The phones screen is perfect the phone is light yet it is a durable phone The accessories available compliments the sleek design and it instantly connected to my old gear fit rather then suggesting that it needed upgraded Thanks samsung for the opportunity to use a great phone This is the best phone I have had to date I started with the SG3 then went to the SG5 but the 7 blows them away Before I discovered Samsung phones I had a couple of different iPhones there is no comparison I am a Galaxy girl for sure Im hooked  I have usually chosen lessexpensive phones in the past and they quickly turned disappointing My Galaxy S7 is lightning fast and has an amazing set of features especially compared to my old phone The social navigation app I use lagged terribly on my old phone and is nearlyinstantaneous on my S7 There are a few UI quirks that take getting used to and some of the features of Android are not available out of the box But those are minor considerations

The screen is gorgeous Bright and amazingly crisp I thought 500 ppi was overkill and it might be but it sure looks great nonetheless 32 GB is OK but the expansion card ensures I wont have memory anxiety Love features are similar to the tablet like saving Internet pages Ive only had this one week but Im so happy with it Initial call will always drop or party cannot hear me Ive only had the device for around a month but so far Ive only found a few things to nitpick about it The overall performance conquers anything you throw at it its the right size for me and I havent had any crashes or weird lockups outside of known issues on the application side With a case the slender design is rendered irrelevant I enjoy the speed of download and how simple it is to use My 74 year old mom has this phone and loves it I cant say enough about this phone Its design its so easy to use I love the health tracker it came with a lot as well Didnt want to get a new phone but had no choice when my Galaxy 3 wouldnt charge anymore  I stayed with Galaxy as I have had them in the past and I got the 7 and I love it Only thing the battery doesnt last as long as they say it does 4 months in and absolutely no issues It just works as it should First off I love my Samsung S7 phone The screen is a great size for my hands and pockets and also packs a wonderful screen resolution to boot The phone is fast responsive and great at multitasking without getting overly hot to the touch 
 Charging this phone is extremely fast because of the Fast Charging feature With both the fast charging USB wire charger and the Fast Charge wireless pad As a note I have a Otterbox Defender Series and the wireless pad still charges my phone from 10 to 70 in about 40 minutes The battery life of my phone while playing games on it for most of the day still lasts me all day and without playing the games I can get around 2 days of normal use before I have to charge it 
 Features are what you expect from a galaxy phone The back Camera is wonderful and takes pictures extremely fast I can take 3 photos within slightly over half a second and the quality of the photos is top notch The front camera is also great for taking selfies The touch screen is very responsive and easy to use The built in speakers are okay for a phone but arent capable of producing deep sounds like in some music The SD card slot makes a return which is a great thing for those of us that like to never delete anything cough cough
 App use on this phone is pretty straight forward It comes with all the standard android apps with a few Samsung ones yet isnt horribly full of bloatware The biggest complaint I have with this phones apps is surprisingly with the camera app I am unable to use the built in flashlight while taking pictures like I could with my S5 which I used quite a lot If you are able to use the flashlight while taking pictures I have yet to find out how 
 Overall I still love this phone and will use it for years to come I rate this phone a solid 45 out of 5 stars for the flashlight issue I have mentioned above mind you it work fine on my S5 and the price of the phone as its pricey when bought without a contract from a provider Just upgraded to this phone and I love how much better it is than the one I had before  The fast charge capability is really amazing when you have a limited time to charge your phone before heading out of the house  I also love how clear the camera is especially how well it works with low light situations  Also a strangely off feature I love is the HD voice feature when talking to someone with the same option on their phoneit sounds like they are right beside you  Takes away all the extra noises around you so driving on the highway you can only hear the person not the sound of the highway they are on per wife she said she loves everything about her S7 This is the best of the Galaxy Saturday series so far I would recommend this model for any body  They made it even easier to transfer your data from your old phone to your new s7 Great phone and love the wireless charger Wish they still offered the whistle as a sound for text msgs like on the S5 I miss that on here Power performance design and usability The galaxy s7 is without a doubt the new standard in mobile phones The phone is just overall faster than my iPhone 6 that I had before Better than iPhone in everyway other than imessages I intended to buy the S7 edge but found that the S7 the phone I now have was the better choice for me with the longer battery life Love this phone The double sided edge throws off the one hand typing Like the single edge on the note Every feature and function works great  The phone is super fast and silky smooth I bought this phone for the beautiful design I love this phone for the great battery life and excellent features My favorite Samsung phone yet I upgraded from a G5 to my new G7 I love the feel the speed  durability Easy to use with a lot of helpful functions I just switch from iPhone and I would never go back Love my galaxy This phone what we were looking for in a phone Had the turbo Didnt like it at all Paid that phone off got the new S7 Barely a week old and we are both learning what we can do very easy to navigate and find and learn new things I had an S5 and just did my twoyear upgrade to stay current  Very smooth transition love the phone Great phone upgraded from the note 4 and it definitely is better in almost every way It was very easy to figure out how to do and find most things on the new Galaxy Call quality is excellent and the camera is so much better than the old one I like that the keyboard has the numerals along the top It worked very well on my recent trip to Brazil I love my S7 new cell phone Its a very sleek and easy to handle The apps are very well created and easy to work with I love the bright screen and colors of the cell phone This is such a wonderful creation of a cell phone I have had this phone for about 2 weeks It is what a cell phone should be like Purchased this phone less than a month ago as my Galaxy S3 was not only long in the tooth but becoming very unresponsive to my commands My charge port was junk so my transition to the S7 was a nobrainer Immediately GPS back and way better than before New modem Snapdragon processor Cameras front and rear Video game YouTube News outlets in 4K robust color Speed like you wouldnt believe The photo quality in low light is unsurpassed even by some SLR cameras This phone does it all and more If you are a Samsung lover like me then the S7 needs to  be a definite 1st Choice for your upgrade The keys are too small I like the camera Got a great deal at Target Mobile to switch to Verizon Plus nice purchase incentives for the 7S   Not quite clear on when the phone uses non wi fi data It doesnt turn on automatically and cant seem to figure out the settings to adjust it ALSO  I would have thought there would be a Verizon APP front and center to have access to all Verizon has to offer verses uploading it later on I have tried all the other major carriers     From what I have seen of Verizons website  I do like it and find it very user friendly I have tried all the other major carriers  Had a iPhone before and drive in areas that have very little signal and the s7 Was loosing signal a lot more than the iPhone I have always been a IPHONE user I made the switch to the GALAXY S7 because I wanted to experience more apps better pictures and I am really enjoying my new GALAXY S7 Its an amazing phone Easy to use This is super fast The network is great and we didnt have to pay anything up front THIS IS TRULY THE SMARTEST CELL PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED THE FEATURES ARE TRULY REMARKABLE I LOVE THE TASKS EDGE THE PICTURE CLARITY IS BETTER THAN MOST CAMERAS AND THE ABILITY TO PERSONALIZE SO MANY FEATURES TO MY OWN SPECS IS GREAT Good decent phone     As expected Great phone Great Camera and the addition of wifi to phone reception is awesome This is my first Samsung device and I love it Took a little getting used to but its very easy to use simple and I can customize however I would like Battery is awesome camera is wonderful Love it all I got the S6 when it came out and loved it When I had to upgrade my phone I choose the S7 and was nervous I wouldnt like it as much The S7 is very similar but has some differences that make it better Samsung has finally gotten it right with the S7 Beautiful design and great features while the software is unobtrusive Although Its definitely a phone to try out in person if you are unfamiliar with the Edge Some people love it while others dont care for the sight distortion that the curved screen causes on the edges Bought this last week so far it is good This phone in my opinion is the best phone Samsung has ever made by far and arguably the best phone on the market right now The phone has a great camera and beautiful display It can also be fully submerged in 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes without a case You are able to video call face time as well The phone and system are easy to use and visually pleasing The ability to expand the storage on the phone using a 64g memory card has given me the space to put all my music on my phone thus having everything I need for the day in one device The only real thing that was a bit of a let down is the battery life doesnt quiet last as long as my previous phone razor maxx but generally I believe that is due to higher use with my music now on my phone as well as all my social media I have had a Samsung S3 for over three years and it has worked wonderfully  However the battery started dying too soon and I took that as a sign to get a new phone  So now I have the S7  This a great device  Very similar in form and function but I do like the bigger screen  It is a lot brighter and I also like how the aps are grouped together  Overall I really like how easy it is to figure out some of the newer features as well as the more familiar ones Good phone too many popular ups Upgraded only because my S3 mini wasnt compatible with Pokemon GO Best decision ever This phone goes all day on normal usages and about 34 hrs on Pokemon GO nonstop not using energy save mode so im sure you could get another hr of use if it was on User friendly and easy to navigate I really like the fingerprint unlock capability Oddly there are certain things that make this phone seem almost an older version than my prior LG G3 Sounds odd but an ex is with deleting emails or texts on my old phone I could swipe and delete as well as hold and select multiplecant on this phone So just little convenience things surprise me that this newest version doesnt offer Also the camera is definitely not as good It takes a long time to focus and the quality of the pix arent as good either Other than that its a great phone This phone is such an amazing item love the color choices got the gold love the apps and the sleek finish that it has so easy to hold and most of all I lover the amazing finger print lock addition The curve screen is ok it makes the phone somewhat difficult to hold Other than that the phone is great I have always had issues with phones I buy through other companies but not when it comes to samsung I love their phones and havent had any issues so far Nothing spectacular about this phone yes its waterproof butt thats it Same as the Galaxy S3 S4 S5 S6 Im a big fan of Samsung products Yes I said this phone is nothing spectacular but dont get it twisted Galaxy phones are the best Samsung Rules 1 phone you wont go wrong purchasing one Enjoy I dont like having to write reviews Yes it has a few new features better screen resolution etc But I feel like I purchased a downgraded version of my Samsung Galaxy S4 Returning to my S4 would be great if my new provider was able to convert it to its wireless network but it cant  I love the ideal being able to speak and it write text or email messages for you and does a very good job Is is a wonderful tool for someone who has a hard time spelling Today I couldnt think how to spell a word and I spook it into my text message and BINGO there it was for me All I can say its GREAT

The other feature that I love is you can push your home button 2 time and your camera will come up no matter what you where doing  its ready to take your picture right away Better battery life than my Samsung s4  Like the features but there is a learning curve So far so good  Easy to work Got this ohone almst a week ago switched from an iphone to samsung S7 I just bought my S7 a few weeks ago and I love it The security features are outstanding especially when you can lock your phone and have to unlock with your fingerprint The free apps are worth installing And the charge on the battery last a lot longer than any other phone Ive had I switched over from iPhone 6 Plus and have to say the Samsung GS7 Edge is way better It works faster and has a lot more features than the iPhone The picture quality seems to be much better Camera is amazing and takes better pictures in low light Definitely glad I switched I love this phone It works well I love the pictures Its light weight I really like this new phone It is fast and reliable I would definitely recommend this to anyone Ive been an iPhone user from the start beginning with the iPad touch then upgraded to the phone I was getting bored with it and neededa change I was told by friends that I would hate switching from an iPhone to an android but honestly I have no regrets Both phones are very similar yet very different But I just like my galaxy s7 much better Changed from Apple so many more options Makes your head spin This is the king of cell phones
Combined with Verizon makes it the best of the BEST definitely was time for an upgrade from the original Galaxy I had used for 510 years I really like the 7 Edge It performance is awesome I previously owned a Note 4 but the screen on the 7Edge suits me fine The camera is amazing I love my S7 Edge I went to HTC but Im back and LOVE my phone The Galaxy S7 is straight forward and easy to operate particularly if you are upgrading from a Droid cell phone The water resistant feature is very reassuring as well as factory installed apps which are useful while getting use to the S7 The screen is bright clear with wonderful colors WIFI connection was smooth and simple To sum up no worries Ive had my phone for a week and love the clarity of the camera Easy to use and I just upgraded from a 4 to a Galaxy 7  Has more memory I love it I wanted this phone for 2 years couldnt wait to get release date I got it I havent had any problems with it all Love the video call feature now I dont have to download apps for that anymore Long story short I love my phone WE both upgraded from Samsung S4s Havent had them very long but are very pleased with the new features such as the larger battery and more modes for the camera Wife prefers the Easy Mode but I like the standard one I use mine for access to our hearing aids and more Had to leave the brand for a while because S5 wasnt available from Verizon with any more than 16gb on board memory Not nearly enough for me Then the S6 was improved but the blasted thing omitted expandable memory and I wasnt about to fork over the extra dough for a 64gb device that might or might not be enough for my needs So I went with a different brand that I really liked and had expanded memory as well as upgradeable battery but it ended up not being as reliable as a Samsung device unfortunately 
So then they made the S7 which finally brought back the ability to expand memory as well as some other really cool features like the very best camera ever in a smartphone The S7 has made it where I can live without the upgradeable battery Android has come a long way in the last few years in that the battery life goes a lot longer and besides I have charger cables everywhere now Theres really a lot to like about the S7 but I just wanted to point out a couple of main issues that Samsung had remedied and improved upon Went into upgrade my phone and bought a cheaper not as big phone at first Was back within two weeks because I didnt like it Had seen the S7 Edge before but didnt want to spend that kind of  on a phone Heard from the sales girl I was working with that is the phone she had and she loved it Thought I would give it a chance even bought the S2 smartwatch at the same time also Have to say I truly love everything about this phone and watch Together they are even better There is not one single thing I have bad to say or complain about Even the initial price being higher than I wanted to spend at the time Im so happy I did and would even pay a bit more if I had to but dont do that The features speed screen quality memory everything is great Have a Samsung UHD TV and it synches up with that easily too Looking into buying a Samsung Tab E this week also for surfing the web and watching videos on a larger screen while saving my phone battery not that it is needed because the battery on the S7 is amazing and the fast charging too Bought a 12v car fast charger that is great and just found a Samsung fast charge portable battery that is on the way to me now Im 100 behind everything Samsung makes and comes up with Thank you for some great amazing products Just got this finally ditched my flip phone I really like it Works just like my Samsung tablet  Much faster than my old one which was a  Samsung Galaxy 4 Everything transferred over including my pictures and apps Overall function wonderful Very similar to my old one only faster so I didnt have to learn a new phone Happy with the product I have had my S7 for about a month so am still learning all the features available I am a moderate user and it does everything I want to do done easily I am anxious to try out Samsung Pay The reviews indicate it is usable in more situations The only limitation is the specific credit card companies it will accept My credit card copy provides Shop Safe where I can create a unique one time use only card number I use it extensively when ordering on line The reason I mention this is Samsung Pay seem to offer similar security when I need to have my card swiped A major plus as far as I am concerned I really like the phone  I was under the impression that it would hold a charge longer  Its just a little better than regular smart phone  However  the turbo charging is a AWESOME Bought it a week ago and at activation time it took two days to get messages to go to the phone I miss the speech text that iPhone has Other than that its good The Galaxy S7 is a vast improvement over any other phone I have owned I only had it for a week The transition from S5 was not too difficult The S7 has a great camera a bright screen volume is loud nice features over S5 A longer battery life faster charging I absolutely love this phone its by far the best phone I have bought since my iPhone 6 I would definitely recommend this product to anybody looking for a great reliable phone I get so many compliments on how sexy my phone is it is a bit pricy but definitely a great buy Used my upgrade for this Having been a pure android fan i was a bit nervous about using this device seeing as it has an overlay Much to my surprise i liked the overlay from day 2 and now I am enjoying the phone even more runs and does everything they claim it does Difficult time and many issues with new phone Website WAS NOT a help Was going to take it back  reactivate my old one Damon Larson was on duty and SUCCESSFULLY transferred everything over and showed me a few tricksoptions and I am using the phone Many apps  ease to find options worked smoothly on old phone Samsung Galaxy 3 HOWEVER technology wants to improveredesign  thereby making a simple steps become  extremely complicated I bought this a few weeks ago and have found it to be more than my android I had for 6 years It is an update and certainly has more to offer than I know how to use I am learning through trial and error videos on how to others helping me I do enjoy it more than I thought In time I will do a lot more and look forward to it simplifying my life What a huge step up from the Note 4 With the VR headset Samsung hit the ball out of the park This phone is amazing You cant beat the speed and the battery lasts forever The screen is amazing Talk about an upgrade Ive had the 7 edge for about 2 weeks Love the phone Starting with the batterylasts so much longer than the s5 didnormally charge last all day and longer Processor is fast Its easy to read and learn Video is outstanding too Love the phonegreat too So far ahead of a Droid So far the phone has been great Easy to use Very happy Love the size and features of the phone Dependable and fast charge is a plus its an amazing phone I absolutely love it I left it out in the sun and and then my son dropped it and my screen crackedfrom being so hot but other than that I love everything about this phone highly recommend My S3 finally died so upgraded to the S7 good in my area 91351 but the real test will be how it works in Westlake Village CA 91361  My S3 was lucky to have 1 bar so hope the S7 will have a stronger signal  Will test it tomorrow Great phone love it fast recorded to lots of people I purchased my S7 2 weeks ago and I live the graphics on this phone Bought it a few weeks ago only complaints are the tempered glass screen protector dont cover the whole screen and they didnt have the otter box defender series case in the store and thats a staple of these kind of phonest they really need the otterbox I bought this 1 week ago and I love it I had an Iphone before this but wanted a  larger screen   Found that this is much quicker I was disappointed when I saw that you guys got rid of the tv remote thing I used it all of the time Also I am afraid of using my phone near water even though you claim that it is water resistant because of the consumer reports on the s7 and s7 edge Over all though I did need an upgrade and the s7 is a good phone Oh and I am also not happy about the nonremovable battery I was fairly nervous getting this phone simply because I have always had an iPhone I absolutely love it Took me just a short time to get use to the transition but truly do not miss a thing about my iPhone Great camera Picture quality is amazing I love that I can personalize so much I have Samsung appliances which I think are hands down the best and now they have won my heart with this phone I switched phone carriers and could have had any other phone that I wanted and picked the s7 edge immediately because of how much I love it The Galaxy S7 is a new and phone  I like the way you an charge it with the expensive charging stand
I have only had it a week and Thanks to Verison cloud I was able to save most everything  
The address book Contacts are still a mess Some I can edit some I can not Dont know why I just had to delete some and re enter them  Seem to have a mess between  phone contacts and message contacts  The new message center is a mess Glad the old one is still available

Why cant you personalize the lock screen picture you could on the 5
I think I should stop here  I preached to my kids that if you cant say something nice dont say anything Purchased the phone several weeks ago its okay for the most part Not really impressed with it that much great function this is an upgrade from my S3 that was a reliable device for 3 years I bought this phone about 3 weeks ago and love how easy it was to transfer from one phone to another  Also love that my battery is not dead by midafternoon Got it this week Happy with quality of the screen and pictures Dont like the edge sensitivity Cant  wait  for case to get here Solid device Good features I replaced my S5 with the S7 a week ago  Im very happy with the new phone  No issues whatsoever Switching was easy Theron was very helpful and friendly Since upgrading my phone to Galaxy 7 I now have a small spot in my house that gets good reception The data continually runs even when I have completely closed all apps My bill is constantly over in data funny no one can determine why Not happy The phone feels good in my hand The screen is clear and large enough to read normal size fonts The only drawback I see is the speaker at the bottom of the phone The way I hold it my finger covers the speaker Otherwise this is a good value Very happy with phone took a little while to get use to the different commands my old S3 had But love it now I have had galaxies since the beginning I missed the 6 But this has so many improvements The only issue I have had is with a couple of the apps but I am learning them The Samsung Galaxy s7 has many great things about it For example its camera is one of the clearest I have ever seen The galaxy s7 is also water resistant so all of the spils it might take probably will survive Overall this phone is great I cant say enough to give justice to the screen so realistic clear turn on camera same thing almost better than real time  i own a 4k tv and the picture does not come close to phones picture i dont see how this phone can b improved no bloatware all stock samsung features awesome camera slick profile water resistance a plus lots of cool features and accessories the color is awesome and the game mode is useful photo clarity bright crisp and great quality easy navigation easy to learn  I love this phone This phone is super cool to say the least Excellent looks amazing screen resolution and color and stellar call quality The processing speeds are lightning and app performance leaves nothing to be desired I have some offhand experience with the S6 Edge and this phone immediately stands out Really enjoying longer battery life and quick charge It was very nice to bring back the memory card option This is the best phone Samsung have all The camera is great that take amazing photos I recently upgraded from a Note3 to the S7 Edge At first I was thinking Id miss my stylus terribly but this phone doesnt need it For someone with large hands its always a pain to type This phone is more sensitive than my Note3 meaning it knows better what Im trying to click on 

Great overall i like my new phone  its slim packed with functions and fast I lost my LGG3 a couple of weeks ago and was in need for a new phone that is water resistant and has a decent battery life I chose this phone because of the water resistance Imean pretty impressed with how intuitive the keyboard is battery life and water durability The voice quality is pretty impressive as well Overall I say its the best phone Ive ever owned I used to be a Verizon employee for 12 years so I know my phones A device As an ongoing user of Samsung devices I have used many Samsung products This phone is easy to navigate and use for whatever your need may be My children use my s7 for gaming and streaming videos games and music I use my s7 for work documents email and pictures mostly However you choose to use your s7 it is fast reliable and very easy to use 
Accessories for my s7 I got the Samsung watch I do recommend getting and it came with headphones and a great charger my s7 charges fast and battery life last all day To anyone that is thinking about up grading your phone or just switching to Samsung this is the phone to have User friendly even for an old guy like myself Love the camera features sharp screen fast loading right size for me fun to use fast charging

cons  short battery charge life protective screen doesnt cover the entire screen area making it hard to use the edges of the screen This is my second galaxy phone and I am delighted with the device I have not experienced any glitches frozen screens or technical problems of any kind with either of the phones So far this phone has been great Love the features and the ease of use miss some of the features from the previous phone Faster more memory and outstanding camera Feels great in your hand Great screen great camera and extremely fast processor Only downfall is no IR blaster The phone is quite buggy and requires restarts quite often to just get a call to go through Just upgraded from the Samsung S4 had it for 3 years and other than battery not staying charged it was by far my best phone I upgraded to the this new one and it is basically the same phone so it was easy to navigate The only thing I am not happy with is having to keep apps on the phone that I do not want I think should be able to delete them to have room I also think that the battery dies faster than they advertised and I am disappointed that it doesnt stay charged as well as I believed it would I still love the phone though and do not regret getting Most value for the money Always gets a good signal and has never missed a beat I would be happy to recommend this product to anyone publicly Good productneed owner guide Bought a week ago  Really like the phone but just dont drop it  The screen cracks easily due to phone is very slick  HIGHLY recommend phone be in a really good case This is the first time Ive owned a Samsung phone and I have to say its awesome It has everything I would want in a phone Tons of customization features great sound and long battery life The water resistance is a nice added bonus as well I have had my phone for about 1 week and I love it so far This is my second Samsung phone I also have an older Samsung tablet I still love too and it is even better than the first The camera is amazing the processor is lightning fast the screen responsive and the size is perfect I would not change a thing Love itthank you Samsung Keep up the good work You have a made a loyal customer out of me Great Phone I love the slim design I really enjoy my camera on the phone it is easy to use and takes wonderful pictures Bought a couple weeks ago and easier to use than what i thought Great phone charges fast too Good phone but does not and cannot ever come up to the quality of the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 The Turbo 2 has a 21 megapixel camera Plus the battery is outstanding and will last at least two days sometimes more If in standby 3 days Thats unheard of Samsung cannot compete Ive had my S7 for a week and so far Im impressed Coming from a Galaxy S5 its refreshing to see how much TouchWiz has improved Havent had a chance to explore everything yet but keep it up Samsung Great phone all around No comparison with the S6 I used to have to charge my S6 at least once a day on the S7 the battery lasts almost 3 days Performance is better as well No complaints and no regrets from upgrading I like everything except the music player It sucks Bring the old one back Super great phone
Couldnt be happier The S7 has been easy to use and brought back the expandable memory I missed The phone works great and Samsung will need to come up with some impressive new features to get me to upgrade I love the S7 edge mostly for the looks But speakers are on the down side This is my first smart phone so I dont have much basis for comparison and I am still learning how to use it In its unprotected state it is quite slim and beautiful with its gold case I opted for safety over beauty and put it in a protective case which adds bulk but also allows it to be conveniently carried on my belt I am very impressed with its capabilities and I know it can do even more when I find the apps that suit my needs 

I wish the battery life were a bit longer but then maybe I am expecting too much as I use it much of the day for listening to audio books or radio I appreciate that it has both a speaker and headphone options It is nice to be able to carry only one device instead of phone cassette player and camera I installed the optional mini SD card for additional storage and it holds a multitude of photos and some audio books with no problem 

It takes great photos I wish it were possible to just connect it to my desktop PC and transfer pictures but so far at least I havent figured a way to do that Fast charge feature is awesome Supports large SD cards Great size and design Wont leave home without it This is a beautiful device that offers a great display better battery life than past samsung phones and a beautiful look The phone can be a bit slippery so if youre not careful with your phone I suggest a case with grip Also for some strange reason the do not disturb mode will turn on at random with the schedule off so I do hope this software issue will be resolved with a near future update Another issue is the keyboard will occasionally become unresponsive and this is disappointing as I no longer have the option to turn touch sensitivity up Other then these minor issues this is a great phone The camera takes spectacular photographs the phone has a perfect weight to it and I would recommend the phone to others I absolutely love my S7 its fast a extremely good camera and it has everything I need Im happy that I decided to stick with galaxy instead of switching to iPhone as I had planned This phone is by far the best phone i have ever had It does all i can ask and more I recomend this phone to everyone Great support Easy to follow features Manual on phone good for reference Ive been super happy with the build quality and performance of my GS7 since day one The camera is on point and I make use of its fast wireless charging features daily despite the battery lasting me pretty easily throughout the day Wonderful product in everyway I would love to do live testimonial or a voice over Would like for the back of them have a less breakable back rather then glass different material but still continue too be unable too open the back Fantastic phone I believe this is the best phone Ive ever owned I told all my friends and family Having upgraded from the Galaxy Note 3 to the S7 Edge I do notice a major difference of speed multitasking and battery life Watching videos is flawless Heck I can actually get it wet because it is waterproof This phone is a must for everyone Since I insist on having unlimited data with Verizon I have to pay the overpriced retail cost But no worries the amount of data I purposely use will more than pay the phone within 6 months Buy this phone The camera is great The screen is breathtaking By the way I have never written a review on any phone before so that shows you how awesome this phone really is Love love love The camera is great sound is awesome Lightweight I like the popups that tell me I have a text message that appear while using another app And I like the option  to either close the popular or view the text Had an old Samsung Fascinate for 6 years  I am amazed at the difference  Everything is sharper clearer and much faster  Wish I had done this sooner Working well so far and have only had it for a week Very easy to use The keyboard is very responsive Screen swipes so easily I just got the phone within the last week  Most things are easy to transition in to but I cant find a way to keep my Bluetooth active in the car It synced but every time I shut the car off I have to turn on the Bluetooth and select my car  Previous phone allowed me to turn on the blue tooth and it stayed on until I deactivated it from the phone
I do like the thumb print feature and the camera is awesome My last Galaxy lasted almost 4 years Why wouldnt I want to do it again And yes it was an easy transition  I DID recommend this to a friend We got our last phones at the same time I told her DO IT AGAIN Ive had the S5 for the last few years but figured it was time for an upgrade I LOVE the new S7 More features more meory its way faster and better photos Thanks Samsung I am in love with my new phone Nice phone easy to use love the wireless recharging feature The S7 provides great display camera and performance Longer battery life and great graphic As a mobile game lover I personally love the new game system they had Also Samsung added the removable sd card back in what we missed when S6 came out 
Overall great phone Love it I would recommend this to all my friends and family it is hard to use the key board as it types when your fingers are close but not on the key you are trying to type I bought this a month ago and it is a great product I like the way it syncs with my other samsung devices No matter where I go I have great access to all of my needed applications calendars notes etc The battery is great lasts me all day I highly recommend the Galaxy S7 Upgraded to this phone and data usage has increased by approximately 50 in the same environment with no change in behavior I recommend the s7 edge to anyone who wants an amazing phone Every feature is worth the amount of the phone Nothing I would say is flaw So far Im loving this phone Ive had it a week now and have played with a lot of the settings and features My previous phone was a Samsung S4 Mini and I really liked it so I knew my next phone was going to be a Samsung as well Im a big fan of the S Health app which has a heart rate monitor has an optional alert that will bug you if you sit too long and will link up with other apps like Nike  Running The heart rate monitor is on the back next to the camera you just press your finger to it and it records your heart rate You can then tell it what you were doing at that time resting after exercise before exercise etc The camera is fantastic the standby battery life is pretty decent screen is a great size neither too big nor too small screen resolution is amazing And unlike the S6 this one does have a micro SD slot which was very important to me since I had one in my previous phone and wanted to swap it to the new one Overall great device with fun features and Im enjoying it thus far I have had my S7 for about 3 weeks Performance is good Now and again when pulling up an email the phone locks up and I have to leave the application and return to read the message The screen has a wonderful picture The camera takes wonderful pictures and they are very easy to take I liked on the S5 that I have I could scroll around the different screens So far the S7 will allow you to go from side to side of the different screens but not scroll around like a carousel 
The battery life has been ok but not what I anticipated I have gone in and closed down some applications that were pre installed that I know I will never used It may have had minimal impact but it has helped a bit I think if memory serves this is my 4th or 5th Samsung phone I do like them and enjoy them I found it very easy to learn the features of this phone Love taking this phone to the pool Water proof  love it Updated from S3 to S7 and what a difference I like that the Power On button is moved a bit lower from where it used to be Also like all the settings that can be accessed from the quick menu when swiping down from the top Beautiful display too I like that the speakers are on the front now not on the back as before Very happy overall Ive only had the phone a couple of weeks Still getting used to all the cool features So far no issues Great phone I am very happy with my new Galaxy S7 I had the S5 and liked it but this is a big improvement All features of this phone is great  The only problem is the location of the volume key which is on the other side of where the phone is turned on so when holding the phone to turn it on the volume is turned down The thing I love about this phone overall is The batey life Beats any phone out there I have had this phone for almost 3 weeks now The battery life is better than I would have imagined I was skeptical at first cause of the curved screen but I found that it wasnt a hindrance after all The S7 Edge has many good features but is severely lacking in the area I traded up for My S3 was dropping calls occasionally Now I cant hold a signal in my small town unless the S7 is cradled in my Sleek 4 signal booster I look forward to the day when Samsung and all phone makers produce a phone that first and foremost makes and holds a signal for a complete call and offers all of the other great working bells and whistles as a bonus I use Pandora a lot and once I bought this phone Ive had nothing but problems trying to listen to music using my own WiFi at home  It only plays one song and buffers til I either open the application or change the station  Ive never had this problem before  It also seems to have a hard time picking up some bluetooth items I got this phone over a week ago wish I would have its worse than my old phone and that one wasnt the best Im taking this one back in for a Motorola Replacement for S5 better photos fast charge  and great screen As with most high end phones turning off features extends your battery life I LOVE this phone I give it A
The camera is AWESOME I loved it until I figured out theres no IR blaster Now I wish I hadnt traded in my S5 Bought this two weeks ago working great I love the S health app Its actually helping me become more active I also love that it had 32gb phone storage plus the option of expandable memory I will keep this phone for awhile I love it I never have to worry as much about this phone because its so much more durable than an of its predecessors and i never have connection issues with it when I use it I really just needed a phone that wouldnt die on me every 3 to 4 hours I love my Samsung phones I started with the 5S and now I own the S7 Edge I just love that Samsung just keeps adding new style  technology to their phones Highly recommended  you wont be disappointed From the body to the amazing camera Phone works well Phone has good features I have several Samsung phones are very good products I would recommend this Samsung Galaxy 7 edge to everyone Just a few small inconveniences only one that comes to mind as Im writing this review is that the settings layout isnt able to be changed as well as the soft buttons setup has changed I bought this phone after buying other none Samsung phones Im glad I ditched the cheap phone for the newest model Im never going back again Got it two weeks ago and love everything about it Great features picture quality is awesome easy to use I bought the S7 Edge to replace my Samsung S4 and I am not impressed at all I waited forever until the SD card returned to upgrade to a newer more advanced phone The camera shutter speed is faster and low light pictures are better but for the price I wish I would have stayed with the S4 I went from an I phone to the s4 which was a good improvement but going from my s4 to the s7 is amazing its a high quality phone Light weight easy to use Lightening fast on all apps Great battery life As a 60 reviewer I can tell you its a great phone and I like the ease of the touch screen and the other functions Add the surround app for the camera mode and take great 360 pictures I have just upgraded from the Galaxy S4 to the NEW Galaxy S7 and WOW what a difference The phone is so much improved its crazy The speed the pictures and just the overall use of the phone is better Samsung is so far ahead of their competition its not even funny And the love the wireless charging ability The battery life on the new S7 has greatly been improved as well Keep up the good work Samsung Im pretty new to the smart phone game as I live kind of a hermit lifestyle So keep that in mind lol That being said Im a computer nerd I just never had a reason to buy a smart phone A week ago I decided what the heck lets get a smart phone specifically the new Galaxy S7

These new smart phones are legit man And having an android phone is a lot easier to operate than a apple phone If youre a computer nerd like me you for sure want to go with android as its a lot less restrictive

After reading tons of reviews online this is currently the best phone on this planet and I have to agree 

Now like I said I live a hermit lifestyle so this is my first ever smart phone and Im not disappointed one bit 

Ive had a few crashes here and there but thats to be expected when installing tons of apps and tinkering around

Other than that the phone operates flawlessly And its super fast Even if there are slowdowns it only lasts but a second and they are far and few between Hardly a bother at all

But ya I really have no complaintsIve been tinkering with the galaxy s7 all day all night

Actually the only bad thing is battery life Turning down the brightness though can fix this Even if you have your phone on the highest brightness setting while playing games or whatever you can still get almost 10 hours of use out of the phonetake that for what you will

In conclusion if youre going to get a phone get this one I had the option of getting the edge but the screen overlays the side borders of the phone and it just weirded me out Its the only difference really aside from screen size so just check out the screen and see which one youd rather have

Im a happy camper Best phone I have had great camera smooth internet usage great phone I would prefer an easier messaging and call icon that seperates online messaging and sms but the one that is on there works great too Easy to use and super fast Glad I upgraded I can see the writing on the wall Soon my regular device phone was going to be no more so I decided Id take the plunge and go to a smartphone I didnt want to be like my parents who got left behind the advanve of personal technology sometime in the late 80s The transition has been pretty smooth It is just the terminology that sometimes stumps me Like Visual Voice Mail I mean wouldnt that be a text In any case after a week of such questions all of the many decisions and settings have been made and the phone is up and running I am sure that Ill find more things to learn as I go along but for now this phone has been flawless The user interface seems to make logical sense Good stuff It basically improvesaid upon the S5 which I had and loved Plus its water proof and for as much time as I spend on or around water is great I got this phone a week got it a week ago so I am still get use to it But I do like it Every feature costs extra Even caller ID I am still having some issues getting the phone to do somethings my S5 did Everyone tells me it is easy to use but I cant get it to do things my S5 did It may take some time Ive only had it a week I love this phone Has some great features Love this phone  Absolutely awesome The best phone I ever had Great features great and great abilities for every day use This is a great phone fits in the hand perfectly and the features are just awesome highly recommend to everyone Always prefer samsung It is a nice phone however I hate the grouped applications and do not really understand the text message features or options  it is more confusing than my S5  Nevertheless it serves my purpose of answering the phone I love my S7 The pics are outstanding So happy with the design and features on my Samsung Galaxy edge I am really enjoying my new phone It was incredibly easy to set up and tailor to my preferences 

The only thing that I am disappointed about is the battery life Compared to my previous phone the battery on the Galaxy S7 even with the battery saver being utilized leaves a lot to be desired I woke up at 6 today with my phone charged to 100 and by noon it has already drained to 75 my other android would have been around 90  in that time I have only replied to a couple texts looked through my email and updated a couple calendar events and listened to a 20 minute podcast while getting ready for work 

Luckily the phone charges really quickly with the provided charger  just means I will have to invest in a charger for my car and my purse so that Im never left without a phone when I truly need it

That being said I would absolutely recommend the phone to friends Getting a day worth of use out of a phone seems to be pretty usual  I am just transferring from a phone with amazing battery life and need to adjust my habits a little I like this phone but my Galaxy S voice is not working as well as it did on my S5
 I havent been able to figure out if I can double tap the home button to activate the Svoice like I could on my S5
Whenever I try to use the hands free option it wont engage 
My voice recognition was better onmy old phone
Other than the Svoice issues I really like it Good phone that has been reliable and packed full of applications Thanks for the great work that you all do I have only had for a week but love it so far Bought it and love it My Galaxy S7 works really great It has a lot of good features and designs to your taste This phone is bigger and better than my old Galaxy S4 Upgrade is well worth it from any other type of phone except Galaxy 6 The reception is not as good as my old Galaxy Mini 4 Phone calls cut in and out for no reason where my old one never did this Kind of disappointed in this I have had this phone for a few weeks now and it is great I am a true Samsung fan as I have several of their products and no complaints Upgraded from Galaxy S5 Features work more efficiently Battery usage much better The phone is very fragile without a case My phone arrived a day before my case I dropped it no more than 6 and cracked the back glass The phone should be able to withstand much more than that Much happier with the battery life of the S7 over the S6 I was happy with all the other features Camera has great resolution Great phone over all Really has no drawbacks I havent tried out the waterproof feature Im not going to intentionally screw up my phone but Ive seen others do it Battery life is great and I definitely love the fast charge feature I bought a clear plastic bumper case and a glass screen protector to aid I really want to buy the wireless charging system though Soon Like the 7 the best so far Im a Samsung Galaxy girl and I love the ease in which I was able to switch from my 4s to the 7

As someone who gets comfortable with my Galaxy I was both excited and nervous about making the upgrade but with all the changes that have been made from 4 to 7 the switch has been painless making me very happy to continue to be a Samsung Galaxy owner I love Samsung but I hate the battery life on the s7 Its supposed to be a big battery but it drains more than any of the others This phone feels good in my hand Camera is fantastic Battery lasts all day sometimes longer Great phone with fast response compaired to the S5 I do miss the IR remote though I am always finding great apps to use on my Galaxy S7 I marked features down a star because there should have been a hidef screen this time This phone is awesome The battery life span is fantastic Really every thing is on point and exciting My only complaint is that there is not in sensor I had a note 4 previous to the s7edge and seriously used the peel remote app all the time Honestly it was one of the top reasons I chose to stay with Samsung So you can understand the letdown when I found out there wasnt one All In all I definitely recommend this phone to everyone The phone is very quick to use There many quick use features like the quick camera and many others The water resistant feature is also very handy The display is clear and bright The upgraded features from the last gen Samsung phones are excellent and easy to use The camera takes excellent quality pictures and has some really cool settings The battery lasts a long time and charges very fast on my wireless charger This is a beautiful comfortable fast phone with more useful features than one can imagine The Camera is fast and produces outstanding pictures really amazing With the Expandable storage and huge battery all day use is no problem and storage is no problem Simple put this is a great phone with ONE BIG PROBLEM The S7 Edge keeps dropping WiFi I had a Galaxy S4 a Galaxy S2 and even a Samsung Infuse  ALL of them stayed connected to WiFi but not this thing I can select it turn on the WiFi use it set it down pick it up in a few minutes and the WiFi is off This happens ALL DAY LONG even nonsense as I have only had this 3 weeks If I got a new one I would have to set everything back up including work email which takes an act of Congress to get I have 3 Samsung TVs 2 Samsung 17 inch laptops all my Computer Monitors are Samsung and as stated before have had many other Samsung Phones but this really takes my appreciation down a notch I love this phone It has great battery life and it takes beautiful pictures It has a vivid display It has very nice features and I like to take photos and it has nice camera Still getting used to the new phone So far so good Does everything I need I dont get excited about phones any more Pros
good camera great in hand not too big not too small

Cons
Browsing speed is low compare to my order phone
Not able to use with VR with cover Got the new phone a week ago and still trying to get everything to work like i want it Not What I expected  at all Very unhappy with this phone I loved my note Well designed It has amazing features It is a quite expensive phone but overall a wonderful phone I do however hate how the phone is a fingerprint magnet I think the camera is excellent on this phone and this is got to be the best Galaxy ever made Great phone Love it Will  buy again Great phone with everything anyone needs to be sociable happy and productive online and off This is a great phone with amazing features The only thing I would change is the internal battery I like the option to remove and replace the battery That is the only thing Id change Iam very happy with my phone I upgraded from the Samsung GS4 to the GS7 when the GS7 first came out and have been in love with it since day 1 The first week I had it I went to the NCAA tourney in St Louis and even running around St Louis all day during the off day between games at that location I had more than a days battery I use the phone a ton all my business calls personal calls and chats fun with games an business aps Samsung listened and has given us the phone to beat any others Sucks sucks sucks sucks phone too expensive Verizon should offer to loyal customers a better price Love it I thought I will never switch from Xperia until this phone great features camera great everything Sooo impressed The camera to my galaxy s7 has amazing quality I love it Excellent phone for those that dont always have access to a computer on the go Amazing features Its not much difference between the 7 and 4 Ive had the S7 for a short period of time but I love it The phone is fast easy to use and the perfect size The battery life is very good and the included wireless charging feature is fantastic Best cell phone Ive ever owned and Ive had plenty to compare the S7 to Enjoying the performance and enhancements after upgrading my S5 to an S7 Easy to use and great features I really love how my new S7 works and the performance is hands down better than other phones I have had The Samsung Galaxy Edge S7 is Fantastic Its design is sweet The set up is sweet The features are sweet Its surely the best phone Ive ever purchased Cant wait to get rid of it So happy I got the s7 I am absolutely happy will this phonemail It has a curve that fits my hands and can one hand text without any problems The camera is so amazing Its so clear and I love the option to take photos in the dark The phone has a great ability to charge faster and longer battery The phones performance is also amazingly fast I do not really like this phone or the features as I thought I would I have had Samsung phones since the S series started Love the progression Each year they get better with more features more memory and faster processors They are easy to learn and all havelse been good phones I just switched to the seven from a note 4 which I loved also I wanted a phone that I could carry with me better that the note series so this is where I am now I love the new 7 It has more features that I will use than the note had We always stick to Samsung because of the quality tablets and phones I bought this phone a couple weeks ago I love it Watching movies on my Samsung Galaxy Edge 7 is awesome This phone is both user friendly and fun I was pleased to see that there was not a bunch of apps already installed on my device as they take up much needed room I also love the camera it takes such good pictures and videos that I no longer use my Nikon camera This phone has everything I want in a phone most on the market do not 

Still room for improvement When reopening an application a new running application window is open which takes away from my memory and slows the phone I would rather have the app open the previous session instead of starting a new one with a new window This has been a good transition phone for my mother in law  Set up on easy mode has made it easy for her to use it without being overwhelmed with features I have always used iPhones before and I decided to switch over to Samsung and I have never been so satisfied with a smartphone before I now prefer this over an iPhone because everything about it is better I would recommend this phone to everybody Like the ease of the phone This phone i would give it a 9 out of 10 The best part of this phone is the camera and the memory I went from the S4 to the S7 Overall it is a great phone I especially like the expandable memory The one thing that could be better is fewer steps in deleting a text Other than that I am totally satisfied with my S7 I have used Samsung product for years and by far this is one of my favorites The build quality is sound the performance is far above average and the battery performance is above and beyond It takes a little getting used to if youve never used Samsung products before but with such a large community you can solve almost every problem you come across This is not a fault of the phone but an issue with android obviously Definitely would buy again This is my first time i have bought myself a brand new NEW phone Ive always gotten a 2nd generation phone so i could give my daughter the new NEW phone 
Incredible I am a semipro photographer and the features on this makes me leave my DSLR camera at home sometimes The screen detail is sharper than a razor and the soundomg the sound The sound setup detailed specifically for your ears makes every song and voice crisp and clear 
One month in and i am still discovering new features 
Love it HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THIS PHONE AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN USE THE VR UNIT ON IT ITS A MUST BUY I am very happy with my phone great camera Love the design I had a galaxy s5 that over heated all the time and just had a bunch of problems with so I was skeptical about getting another Samsung but when I played with the s7 in store I was immediately sold on it The camera is absolutely amazing I compare it to my friends that have iPhone and it beat the iPhone in every category The phone is fast and responsive I live my new s7 My new jack its bomb its the Mega on Beast mode Everything you would expect from the best cell phone company in the world Its nice to be able to step out of the pack and be the individual and the best at the same time Customization are great its like have a new and different phone everyday This camera is amazing and the speed of the phone is awesome Key stroke keeps up with you I got this phone when I switched to Verizon and its a nice phone but not as fantastic as the reviews would lead you to believe Bought  two of these one for my wife and one for myself The transition from the S5 was seamless Nice improvements as well as additions Glad I made the switch back to an Android from the iPhone Still too new to me I love my new phone  It was an easy transition from my old phone is light weight and easy to use I have had the phone for a week  Although I like the functionality  I am having several errors phone completely freezing pics not sending through text and there was a 2 hr span where I could not send texts  I restarted the phone 5 times and force stopped the app   Nothing fixed the issue  As soon as I would click the text area to begin typing the would get the spinning circle for minutes until it gave me an error message Then out of the blue it started working  As of now pic messages still will not send This phone took all the great features from the S5 and the S6 It has water resistance expandable storage fast charging wireless charging and the speed of it is unreal I have had a lot of Samsung devices and this is by far the best The only thing that could boost this from Excellent to Perfect is to bring back the IR BLASTER and allow use of data while on a phone call I know that these are not of importance to most people but I used them alot and it set Samsung apart from alot of other companies with these cool features Also the phone is ridiculously thin and looks very nice and sleek In conclusion this is a great phone that only has a few minor flaws I had an S5 and before that a Droid and never dropped calls  My coworker has an S6 Edge and never drops calls  This one drops the sound so people cant hear me but I hear them  Only at work  It also has trouble loading websites even on Wifi I like the Samsung Ive never used another phone but always hear people complaining about their phones not Samsung Happy with the battery life of my phone I have had this phone for about 3 months now and have had to hard reset it once already This phone will restart on its own at least once a day The camera is awesome and when everything works the phone is great Might need to trade this for another thinking it may be defective Purchased phone in April absolutely love it Great display very clear bright and colorful easy to use and no problems takes excellent pictures Love the gold color Owned the GS7 for 2 weeks now Coming from the Galaxy S5 Im very pleased with the changes They eliminated that usb connector door and the fingerprint scanner is actually usable now

Performance seems decent although Im skeptical it will last My S5 gradually got slower over time and I dont bog it down with apps and did regular maintenance

I like the look of the new display there seems to be an edge bevel on the glass which somehow feels appealing

I love the wireless charging although it seems a tad finicky about how you place the phone on the charger Charge time is very reasonable

Could be my imagination but there seems to be less bloatware than on previous products If this is true and intentional its much appreciated Id rather load what I want than have to delete a bunch of stuff I dont 

I havent messed with the camera too much yet but the few pics I tried were great

Ive noticed cell reception may be little worse than on the S5 but could be a fluke during these initial weeks will keep an eye on it Had a lot of people saying the call broke up we were both asking can you hear me now but neither could Had to hang up and redial

Overall though very pleased Got everything as expected Works great Easy to utilize features immediately one month in and all is well I have had several different Samsung Galaxy phones prior to my new S7 Edge and have loved them all However not as much as this one It even feels goodcomfortable in my hand Its easy to use and has a TON of features that I am STILL learning about but I received an email with all of the instructions and videos for all of the features I know so many people with iphones who are constantly having big problems with them but in our family we have never had troubles with our Sansungs I am extremely happy  Ive had a different android for a while but was nervous about the increase in returns lately Samsung G7 has great reviews so I thought Id give it a try It didnt take long to learn the systems I love the easy set up camera and dependability I understand why my daughter loves her Samsung as well great phone I love it  easy to use which is important to me  Im 66 years old and not high tech literate  screen is bright and clear and the audio is VERY good  I have hearing aids and this phone works great for me Phone is fine Has lag sometimes on keyboard This is another great upgrade from Samsung Just upgraded from Samsung Galaxy S5 Transition was seamless Would recommend It is more difficult to rename photos It is horrific to figure out how to transfer photos from ph to computer Hours with tier 2 tech support and they still couldnt help No longer has back up log on Time consuming to have to swipe first then use password Wish they had white
Sound is louder Speaker works my gs5 never did I was happy to buy this phone but in less than a week I already had 2 small dents on the edges of the screen  I expect better from Samsung  Im very careful with my things but this is very fragile and for the price I could of gotten another phone that was durable from another carrier I am sure the reason that I am frustrated is that I had the old phone so long  There are a lot of changes and upgrades that are great and I am sure that once I figure them all out I am going to love this new phone  The photo quality is so much better than the S5 and I love the look  It seems really easy to use and getting use to the differences are a pain but oh so much better than before It is my 3rd Galaxy would not have any other They work well and I have had no problems Nothing about it seems any better then the S5 version In fact they took away the ability to swap out batteries so you could argue its a downgrade And with the curve on the screen edge if you have a screen protector like any sensible person does it makes it harder to interact with the edges Black screen at 14 days of usage replacement phone not much better think it may be refurbished I have been a Samsung user since the fascinate Now the fascinate did lag and that is why initially I switched to iphone But I wasnt happy with the features or how you couldnt customize ring tones etc so I switched back to Samsung Ive had the note3 alpha active6 and the s7 The newer phones didnt lag at all so i was very happy I just upgrade every so often and Im never disappointed Whenever I upgrade I always get to keep my old one because they never break and are very durable Did I mention when I switched from the iPhone I had briefly it was because the screen cracked and I needed a new phone It wasnt going to be another iPhone  I love the Samsung product line I have used other manufacturers phones through work but always have best luck with Samsung nice phone great graphics decent sound lots more features than i use happy with it overall The new galaxy 7 is easy to use and quick at reacting The battery life is ok but I may need to make some setting changes yet to prolong the time The camera takes  wonderful sharp pictures  The fast charge cords are amazing  I would recommend this phone Upgraded to this phone on a Sunday and was back at the store the next 3 days with nothing but problems with it freezing Got another one did the same thing Every 2 mins it go black freeze and shut off So annoying  Switched back to my s5 till I can get a new phone in the morning Hoping the edge is better I have had a lot of Android phones This is by far my favorite phone All the way from the features to the screen I cant wait for the S8 to come out I love my new phone all the features and options that are available to me are outstanding Directions are clear and easy to follow The operating systems are easy to use and if you have a problem resolutions are easy to find and implement Everyone in my family  but me has an I phone to me is not as user friendly as this operating system I will never change I would recommend this product to all of my friends and family What can I say just look at that beautiful curved glass front and back The edge screen comes in handy for accessing apps and widgets quickly and effortlessly The screen is huge without the phone being too wide The video quality is fantastic The apps run smooth and flawless I love that I can make a call using my WiFi I must say that I do enjoy everything about this smartphone Especially the fact that its waterproof and my life proof cover is waterproof Comes in handy when you got small ones running around with squirt guns Everything is just about the same from my old Galaxy S6 Edge plus except for the extra volume button when making calls I really miss that But the other features on this makes up for that small detail I had two Motorola phones that I loved Unfortunately within a year of using them they both began to break down Within two years they each stopped working all together 
I picked up the new Samsung Galaxy s7 with the hope that it was a better piece of electronics Ive had the phone less than two weeks and Im not very happy The battery wears down in half the time of the Motorola and it doesnt have a few of the features I really loved the most in my previous two phones Yes the Galaxy does have some cool features my Motorola did not have but if I had to do it again I would have picked out a third Motorola even though the last two died after 18 months Only time will tell if this Galaxy last longer than the others good value

appeance good
reliable
good feature
light weight Had to replace a note 4 this so far has been a big step up  Wouldnt go back I really expected Id get a lot more battery life out of the phone but it seems like it lasts 6 hours at most without needing a new charge Everything else about the phone Im a fan of so far but thats pretty disappointing Thus far I am enjoying using the edge it seems to be user friendly
I do miss the stylus a week bit I love this one by far the most or of all Ive owned  which is almost all them  One small downfall is the fragile back of itbreaks line glassget a case I find the camera and VR much better then the iphone i used previously Ive had it about 2 weeks and like it so far I needed to get new phone So far so good I am enjoying my Samsung Galaxy S7 Its user friendly of great quality and was a wonderful choose from my new phone this is the best phone i have had and yes i would do it again and as far as an good support system Verizon has the best Had this phone for a week and a half and while i love it i regret getting this one Normally you have to worry about breaking the screen but with this phone its not onlybthe screen that will shatter but the back of the phone will as well I learned that after mine fell from just a few inches on to the back Phone works really well but I am pretty sure a potato would work well on this network Verizon is the best I went from a note 4 to the S7 Edge and have not been disappointed This phone is lightning fast Though I havent found a ton of usage for the edge screen it looks great and have had no issues with accidental screen presses The battery on this phone is where it really shines Even under heavy usage I still havery enough to make it through a long day This is even with Bluetooth paired and WiFi on all day Highly recommend I was a little hesitant to go from an iPhone 6 to a S7 but when I made the leap I discovered that I really enjoyed the flexibility of the S7 compared to the ridged layout and functionality of the iPhone 6 Its also water resistant The information transfer from iPhone to s7 was flawless I did it myself All in all Im very satisfied with my purchase I also got the oculus for free and its pretty interesting cant wait for more apps for that Ive always dug Samsung phones this one is the best so far cool features and intuitive the battery is better than my s5 was however could be better Id recommend this phone compared to everything else on the market I got one on Monday 11 July and one on 18 July happy Bought this phone to upgrade from my S4 love it Still think they are all to much money but the other one was starting to act up after 3 years I like the feel of the phone It performs well however the battery does run down about 34 of the way through my day The apps especially some calendar features that I can obtain are my favorite Camera is quick aND has some awesome editing features Happy with this s7 device I have used the Samsung Galaxy S3 S5 and now the S7 The S7 has the best feel and look out of the three phones I really like the higher memory and the expandable memory The camera is also by far the best camera I have used in a phone Some features that I do not like are the system memory takes up way too much memory space I had this issue with the S5 although I had a memory card the system memory took up so much space that I constantly had to delete apps Moreover it seemed that with every system update the system memory would increase substantially Also I prefer to have a removable battery even if the phone is less waterproof the water resistance of the S5 was more than enough for my use Lastly the location of the speaker is poor I prefer the speaker on the backside similar to the S5 I always seem to mute the speaker with my pinky finger with the S7 I bought the phone about 1 week ago  The battery life far exceeded my expectations  I hope it continues to do so  I have only charged it about 2 times after the initial charge  Lasted 25 days one time  Good features easy to use even tho it is different from my last phone  Still learning where everything is located I switched over to Android back when the Note 2 arrived I upgraded to the 3 and then the 4 Those were good phones buy I was never completely satisfied I decided not to go with the Note 5 and its been the best decision ever This phone is perfect for my needs and I couldnt be happier I had a IPhone 6plus before this one and I am glad I made the switch I bought this phone on the 1st of June and loved it however the screen is SUPER fragile and it costs a lot of money to fix broke the screen the second day I had it when it flipped over onto the pavement not even a drop but I had it on my shirt and it flipped over and cracked This phone NEEDS a case and having it without one feels pretty incomplete since the whole thing even the back is made of glass and makes you feel very naked without the case

Even though the design is a bit scary the phone is very fast and it has a very long battery life I loved it more than my S5 by far but for the love of god get a case The edge app doesnt really get much use from me so I dont really know what to say about that but there are some edge apps on the store that make this phone look very cool I love the phone Its speed is fantastic and not too large to carry or put in your pocket I love how the speakers are at the bottom but the only feature that I dont like is that there is no more remote control ability I just got this phone and so far its great Love that I dont have to keep charging my phone every two hrs Battery last way longer That Camera is super AWESOME I love this phone Ive been a galaxy fan for years the 7 is by far the best Water resistant the display is amazing as well as the camera is fantasticif I had one complaint it would be that it doesnt come with the IR Blaster I believe is the name of it that allows you to use the 7 as a remote controlother than that this is a great phone I purchased this phone because my S4 was getting to be a roblem with memory I do use a lot of features and have noticed the battery life hasnt changed much Moved from an S5 to S7 last week  New phone is more responsive and quicker than previous  Camera much improved Words cant explain how much I love my phone Bought this almost a week ago Love the size and love a lot of the features on it Just wish the battery lasted longer and that it would charge faster on a charging cord that didnt come with the phone I have some 10 ft  long charger cords and takes forever to charge my phone compared to other devices A year ago I had a Galaxy S4 phone I switched to the IPhone Man that was a big mistake Im now back with the Galaxy S7 and I love it The OSS camera and just about every feature is 10X better than the IPhone Ill Never leave again easy to use great clear screen Phenomenal phone must have Ive had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I love it It has some great features and you can really personalize the settings to make it fit your needs I wasnt in the market for a new phone but when the charging port on my Note 4 got wrecked I decided if I could upgrade Id get the latest and greatest Samsung phone After about a week of having this I know that was the right decision Its a great Android device syncing perfectly with everything I had right from the getgo Its a smaller screen than I was used to but nothing to complain about The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because the battery can get REALLY hot with extended use Certain mediaheavy apps heat up the battery so much its almost too warm to continue hanging on to After a few minutes of downtime though it cools off It also has an extremely long battery life except when using Pokemon Go It would be nice if the battery was more accessible in case I had to do any sort of manual shut off for issues that may arise but its something I can get over since I dont foresee issues anytime soon Fantastic phone for a beginner and a veteran smart phone user Fast slick and easy to learn 10 out of 10 Memory specs and battery life of this phone is very refreshing compared to the competition out there Have had this about 5 weeks Battery life is good Love the phone It is very user friendly and fits comfortably in your hand Not clunky or too big The options for edge settings are amazing as well Long battery life even with back groubd apps running I love it Went from a droid maxx to S7  So far Im not impressed at all  Majority of the features are not much different than the Maxx including battery life  I thought my Maxx had a lot of bloat ware but this phone is crazy loaded with tons of bloat ware  Maybe a lot of the features I dont care for is more of a learning curve of using this phone but there are a lot of features that require extra touches to get to the same place that less touches require on the Maxx  Making calls and text messages require additional touches which is sad considering its the major functions that I use for these devices

The other thing I notices is the signal strength is significantly weaker than the Maxx  I havent fully tested the signal but certain places in my house I loose connectivity and never had that problem with the Maxx

Unfortunately you are only provided 14 days before you can return the device  I have since past that time period but at first opportunity I plan on returning to the Motorola phone  Ive had those for at least 6 years and enjoyed them  The only reason I tried the Samsung was all the hype these phones were getting so I thought Id try it out Love my new phone Easy to use and clear conversations I love this phone The battery lasts all day I enjoy using the edge feature The device kept urging me to download messenger  Thinking I had to have Messenger to receive messages thru Facebook I did that Now every time someone texts me I get 2 messagesone from the text and  one on Messenger  Its  a nuisance to have to check each message twice
Also I was disappointed that several apps that were not factory apps  that I had downloaded myself did not transfer over from my old phone  I lost the connection for my Fitbit Uber Zedge ringtones etc I truly enjoy this phone It does everything that I need and the camera is AWESOME Great phone Great case too  Otter box My droid maxx was a much better phone Happy yes indeed A GREAT PHONE NO QUESTION Upgraded from the 4G and so happy with the Samsung I bought this phone to replace an IPhone I have been an IPhone user since 2007 This phone blows away my iPhone experience Also I bought a samsung Tablet and it has made managing my Music and videos for my 5 year old a snap So much easier than with my apple devices My wife loved my phone so much so went and purchased the same one So two IPhone users since 2007 switched Have been using this product since March and impressed more and more everyday And yes my 5 year old has dunked my phone in the fish tank bathtub etc and the commercial is true It worked flawlessly after coming out of the water Havent tried the champagne yet but I am sure my 5 year old will come up with something similar by accidentWith the phone being waterproof havent needed a waterproof case Not sure if anyone else experienced this with iPhone but when in a waterproof case it makes it next to impossible for people to hear you on speakerphone video calls etc Samsung you blew apple away with this product You guys are rock stars The samsung galaxy s7 and Iphone 6 both have their pros and cons The iphone is a bit easier to use and get music on The iphone also has the instant reply which I enjoyed The samsung is a really fast phone and charges fast The biggest reason why I got the Samsung Galaxy is for the micro sd card slot The iphone simply didnt have enough space Great premium product exceptional features updated UI preloaded with good apps I absolutely enjoy every second I spend using my Galaxy 7 Edge Its performance and features are so impressive I use it constantly in my work as a restaurant manager to help input orders take calls take pictures of customers and simply to help me run the place There are wide variety of accessories for the 7 Edge such as the many Smartwatches and especially the GEAR VR What a wonderful toy for all ages
I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it to anyone This product has great features display great Themes colors and font great I totally love my new phone  So easy to use lots of great features This cellphone it the best cellphone of the world I love everything the system the camara everything its really good The S7 is everything you would expect from Samsung It packs power and has everything you pretty much could want Im a huge fan of the overall design and how well it fits in your hand Great improvement over Galaxy S4 I upgrade from the Note II to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and have been really happy with the upgrade The S7 is much faster has a lot of easy options and was very easy to transfer my apps and info to from my old smart phone The size is much more manageable than my note as I do not have giant hands so I can more easily navigate with one hand which I like I wish there was more widgets As long as it doesnt break as easy as the S5 then Ill keep shopping Samsung The camera is great I acquired this phone Saturday to replace another brand I have always been a fan of the other brand but this phone tops what I preveously had by leaps and bounds Recently I upgraded to the S7 only had it a short time and so far love it It has a great display and its very fast and easy to use I use the camera a lot for work with some of the other features works great Very satisfied with this new phone and features Nicehard to get use to works well enough 1st smart device Just learning need time to get up to sped on everything This is such an nice clear phone call when I am speaking with people it is like they are right next to me especially if they have the Same phone I have had S4 S6 and S7 I must say so far the S7 is my favorite Bringing back water resistance and the SD card were awesome additions Great feel to phone well built wonderful display I love that have Samsung Tablet Phone and Smart TVs let me use features between devices easily The S7 is quick to respond sounds and looks great They ONLY thing I have found I am not a fan of is there is a VERY SLIGHT curve to the sides of screens and glass screen protectors tend to get lint stuck to the sides because a tiny portion does not quite make contact Otherwise I am VERY happy with the phone in all regards Vastly improved from the Galaxy 6 I love the water resistance features as well as the cameras does not blow my mind but very good faster than the S5 battery is not as superb as Id have liked but does charge very fast Could use better default apps I BOUGHT this as week ago I like having the apps and access to the internet I have had this phone for 16 days and love it The only difficulty is how fast the battery tends to die I had  a galaxy s for over 3yrs loved it later i got the galaxy 3 had it for 3 plus yrs very good phone an now i have the S7 an its even nicer samsung u just keep doing it better love my  samsung I have samsung laptop an samsung bluetooth as well love them all U just keep making them better love u guys Love every feature except apps are not as easy to get upload and work the same as iPhone and I wish the voice recognition of notion feature was easier to use and more accessible My best feature is the look and feel Its what I was looking for ln size and the special look of the GOLD exterior I found that it was easy to learn and maneuver thru the screens I like it very much Good job Samsung The Oscar being Android is not bad at all Still learning to use the phone but photos looked really good with it Only had it a week but so far so good Upgraded from note 4 to the S7 Edge I couldnt be more happy so pretty and responsive with an amazing camera and build 
9510
Love it The performance and ease of use is great I went from a Note II to this S7 and couldnt be happier Sure the screen size is smaller but the colors really jump out at you The camera is amazing and love the pro feature where i can manually change the settings You wont be disappointed with the camera i promise that Also i read reviews about the battery not lasting long I can use this all day with at least 12 of the battery life still available This is talking and playing with the Oculus Not sure what other issues people are having with that but im not one of them I really like the Samsung Galaxy s7 It has great features I love thats its also completely waterproof The display is awesome with very vivid colors The battery life is a plus also I would definitely recommend to anyone young or old for business andor pleasure It seems like the same style as other popular phone but has great features Love that I wont have to worry about getting the phone wet I would recommend this phone if someone was looking for a phone with grea tfeatures Bought for my wife as an upgrade  Easy to use Best features and design Upgraded from a Samsung flip phone My first Smart Phone so far its simple to set up and use Have had zero issues with this phone
Battery life great 
Camera great
Could use a little less apps that are preloaded My wife and i got these phones only weeks ago but love them Better than my iPhone 6s Still wish it had interchangeable batteries This is a awesome awesome phone that it Meats and beats the Galaxy S5 on all counts Im having a difficult time touching on the letter and number pad exactly where I need to for them to work Sometimes I have to press them hard and sometimes not Im going to need to go to the HELP page fairly often I think Great phone Like the various tools that are easy to locate Slimming Easy to get use to I was reluctant to get a new cell phone I found out that my intuition was correct I would NOT recommend this to anyone My moto x pure has never unexpectedly rebooted or gotten hotlaggy in the months Ive had it My S7 started doing that after 3 days showing Process system isnt responding every time it started Clearing the system cache didnt help safe mode didnt help and the error even came back after I did a factory reset and re installed all of my apps None of this started until the last update from Verizon overall excellent phone to many info popups battery life is good volume better than some I was holding on to the S4 since storage was a huge issue for me and the camera is the number one feature that I use Something I didnt see coming was the durability of the S7 The 2nd day I had the phone I dropped it while running on the treadmill and it flew off the back EEK Not a scratch bump or bruise on the phone even without a case on it PHEW The camera is AMAZING and I love the extra storage space and the ability to have an SD card for anything extra you might have I also love the small hands keyboard so its easier for my tiny TRex hands to hold the phone and text using only one hand 

I have an old contract that upgrading to a new contract is NOT beneficial so I had to buy the phone outright PUKE That is the only real con so far I have noticed the microphone isnt picking up very well when Im on speaker phone but havent done any troubleshooting yet Ive had the phone about 3 weeks now Before this upgrade I had a razor my that I had grown dissatisfied with and decided to get an upgrase I chose the S7 and its been extremely reliable phone  It has a lot of useful features and good battery life This is by far the best android phone Ive ever owned The camera is what impressed me the most Takes really clear and very vivid pics A 2016 must have item A brilliant device it should be Samsumgs flagship device for years I upgraded from Note 4 to an Edge and oh my  i dont regret This is a wonderful device with great display features like Edge and a great camera for low light snaps Hold Onwhats more  You can add memory thank you Samsung for bringing back the the slot Great phone  i had it for a week now it does everything  i need for work easy to use  i think its the best phone  on the market I was so close of switching to the iPhone after being an andriod user for so long The screen on the phone is amazing and the same for the camera I would highly recommend this phone if youre on the fence like I was when buying a new phone This is a business device Will likely have few apps loaded and will be used mostly for email and photos But its nice The Otterbein works well with it So I bought this a month ago and was expecting it to be pretty amazing but it exceeds my expectations This phone is awesome I had a GS5 and the differences between that and the S7 Edge are amazing It feels lighter better photo quality faster processing power plus a lot of additional features that I cant list them all Have had my S7 about a week The transition from my S6 has been pretty easy  Im a tech novice My only complaint is I was told my apps I had downloaded on my S6 would transfer over  the app did but my information lists memos etc didnt But that made it just like previous upgrades Oddly half of my contacts didnt transfer either Other than this I really like my phone The new S7 Edge is full of amazing features including a very interactive and customizable edge screen with color coded silent alerts for contacts The curved back screen feels great in your hand which is great for one handed use The battery life is amazing and there are a number of different energy saving options for even greater battery life This paired with wireless and quick charging allows you to enjoy your phone whenever you wish I would highly suggest this phone to anyone Easy to usegreat camera keep getting a message that says no internet connection Does not matter what my signal strength is My wife and I got the Galaxy S7 phones a week ago  We went camping and my wives phone dropped in the water unknown to us at the sand bar It was found the next morning  8 hours in the water and still works  Amazing New and useful features to discover weekly This phone is easy to use and customize I only wish they would make a better screen protector or a better case that wont case the protector to peel off I bouth this 2 months ago and love the speed of the phone and the camera resolution  Also it charges fast and the batter life seems to be twice as long as before  I love the options to move the apps This phone is incredibly fast especially compared to my Samsung S5 It has more storage and the software updates are intuitive This is my first samsung phone ever pervious phone was an HTC One M8 Pervious phone had a failing battery and I got tiered of constantly looking for a place to charge Went on a family vacation and noticed my brother and his wife raving about there Galaxy 6 phones so I got to play with them awesome phones awesome features awesome camera Needless to say I had to get one so walked in to my local ATT store and grabbed a Galaxy 7 edge and Ive been in love ever since I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone This is my third Samsung  Always easy to get set up and use  My fav phone Phone to big and bulky Best phone ive owned so far Very quick and speedy Love that they brought back the sd card slot Phone has everything youd need Only cons are trying to find a good screen protector and that this phone has a hardware defect with the back camera glass Users are reportingme also that the back camera glass breaks very easily without you having to do anything to it Everyone that has posted a picture shows that almost every glass break looks exactly the same that they had a protective case on the phone and they didnt drop it hit it or anythingit just magically breaks on its own Mine broke 1 week into owning it and i didnt do anything physical at all with my phone Thats the only reason i selected poor quality other than that phones quality is awesome My previous phone was the S5 and I recently got the S7 Edge And comparing the two Im amazed at all the new features my S7 has Ive only had it for a couple weeks but so far its been pretty amazing Havent tested out its water resistant capabilities yet though Its still early not even a month into the new phone  But i do love it  The operating  system seems to be better working than iOS  Time will tell  Im hoping for longevity with it  Its easy to use and more customizable than the iPhone  Its easier to put things where you want them and organize screens and apps that fit your needs  Id recommend it to anyone I enjoy my new Samsung photo Best upgrade ever exactly what I expected yrs ago Love my oculas I love my S7 Its light fast and the screen is so HD what I really love is the water and dust resistant rating Literally washed my phone off today in the sink the phone you have cant get any betteralong comes the S7 and blows your mind Easy to use and great camera I have had several cell phones and by far this one is the best I use it for both personal and work use and it excellent in both areas Its connectivity is second to none The memory capacity is amazing The camera is as good as any digital I have used Upgraded from galaxy s5 phone is similar yet better The screen is large but in a seemingly small form factor You can hold it comfortably in the palm of your hand Not gigantic looking for feeling like its competitor
It has all the bells and whistles Used all the various camera settings You can get great shots in any light setting for situation eg sporting events without compromising clarity and accuracy of the shot Also not spending a lot of time figuring out how to work the settings
I got the Samsung S2 Gear smartwatch to go with it Love it Pairs easily Even used the watch in the car to receive a call Seamlessly works with the Edge Lots of apps to choose from
This will be my phone for several years The best Ive had so far I made the switch back to Android and Im so glad I did Ive had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I love it Its the bees knees I love my camera texting speed to Web ease of setting up emailEVERYTHING There wasnt any documentation to make it easy to get the Galaxy S7 working  Also there are so many applications that I have know idea if they are needed or not  I still cant get photos imported into my Windows 10 computer  Overall it is a decent phone but it took a long time to figure out the new phone The only thing I have found to dislike is that the protective screen cover that is made to fit this phone does NOT fit It is not wide enough and so a line goes down both sides of the screen right where you want to read fine print I think this is because the screen is not flat and rounds back slightly They need to make it flat or develop a rounded protector that actually fits I had to remove mine so now there is not screen protector I bought this phone and service on the recommendation of others Bought a few weeks ago Love it so far Clear screen Longer lasting battery Came with extra battery pack I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone whos looking to upgrade It has been a blessing to not have to charge my phone 3 or 4 times during the day I love the extra large capacity and that it can get wet and not damage it I love Samsung Galaxy phones and will continue to purchase them Had my S7 for a week now Really like it so far Nice size and fast The screen is big enough to comfortably watch videos yet isnt bulky  I also like the fact that its water resistant and has wireless charging Was using a different brand for the past few years This is so much faster and exponentially more user friendly If Samsung had come out with a newer Galaxy Mini I would have bought that but now Im glad that they didnt This phone rocks and has all the features that I need The single rough point is the transfer of some Smemo files from the s4 They showed up in the new phone but I have not yet been successful in opening them I like the water resistance since I did once drown a phone Overall I am very happy with this purchase and this may become a five star review after I get more used to the phone Stay tuned The galaxy s7 is an amazing phone Updated features and camera make this phone superior to all the other galaxy versions Moved up from a Galaxy S5 so there quite a few improvements but the one I really like is the better camera  Battery is better and love the quick charge I just love the phone overall  it charges up fast and I love the features The slimness of the phone makes it easy to use especially one handed Its not overly heavy or bulky I finally upgraded when I was having memory and glitching issues with my Galaxy S4 No regrets This phones battery life is horrible Im going back to iphone first chance I get I have an S5 but this S7 has even better features This truly is a great cell phone Ive had the phone for about three weeks now and the only problem I have experienced is that my phone would not recognize my swipe pattern After so many tries it told me I had to wait 1 minute before I could try again So I did It still didnt recognize my pattern So I decided to turn my phone off and back on again and I tried two more times before and it told me to wait 10 minutes So I did and I let my phone sit for a few minutes longer and then it recognized the lock pattern Its scary and theres nothing that you can do about it Granted I upgraded from an S4 so there are likely many features that were included in the S5 and S6 that Ive missed until now but this is a great phone Sleek design great battery life amazing camera
The one con Ive found is that the accessories are not all designed well for this phone Even though I have the standard S7 not the Edge the edge of the screen is still slightly curved It seems that screen protectors have not been able to be designed to accommodate this a glass protector will not curve for the screen and even the plastic protectors do not fully curve or cover the screen This creates annoying bars at the edge of the screen and can lead to dirt getting trapped underneath making the problem worse Also cases still do not seem to be fully fitted partially due to the screen curvature at the edge 2 Samsung smart tv  s 84 tablet 2nd phone love it They just keep getting better Samsung is leading the pack with everyone else playing catch up Customer service is great and this S7 is fabulous camera is super battery last forever Dont take my word for it give it a road test you wont drive anything else Awesome product Would buy another one I love the way it displays the pictures The Galaxy s7 is the best one yet Its features  quickness of response time is great Have nothing negative at all to say Well done yet again Samsung I am very happy to have finally purchased a Galaxy S7 Ive had my eye on the Galaxy since its beginning but chose to stay with my previous phone Well I finally decided to take the plunge and have been enjoying discovering the S7 ever since Im looking forward to using this phone to the fullest and highly recommend everyone to make the switch Found this phone to be more exciting than I expected Other than expected launch bugs thus phone has really blown me away Its sleek and stylish and does everything I need and more Easy to setup easy to use Phone is fun to play around with Fast charging is great And the screen is real bright I love this phone I had to get rid of the Droid It was 6 months old It would go off and on at will I previously had the S5 and loved it I really like the design of the phone It has great features and is a nice break from iOS My only con about this phone is that I wish It had the octocore processor that wont be here until September Other than that its one of the best on the market Definitely a flagship phone Works well Still getting used to it but its much faster than my old Samsung S4 Mini Plus it has twice the space than my old phone I was able to put it back in on my Play Store apps that I had to delete from my old phone and I still have plenty of space left Some things take getting used to such as Im so used to my old phone that I often try to push buttons that I had gotten used to doing a certain function and the buttons on this new phone are different Im getting the hang of it though Like I said super fast takes beautiful pictures and very comfortable in my hand I would recommend this phone to anybody Ivery only had my new Samsung S7 for a few weeks but so far Im very happy with it I love the way it feels in my hand the smoothness and weight Ive yet to discover all the features every day I learn something I had a Samsung Note 4 before this phone and one thing I do miss a little is the pen the Note 4 has I used it all the time Other than that Im pretty happy with this one Everything works well I love everything about this phone except for the constant bugs in the gallery application It takes forever to display my pictures some of them in the gallery view only shows half of the picture and it crashes almost every time I use it Im one of those guys that upgrades their phone at least once every 2 years sometimes 1 Id also like to mention that I always go for the flagship phones I like to have the latest and the greatest 

Usually Im content with the new tech toy With the S7 Im ecstatic Battery life is great its waterproof snappy amazing screen and colors top of the line camera It has all the bells and whistles expandable memory you name it

Best phone Ive every had Everything I have at home is through a competitor My phone would complete the ecosystem Ironically Im glad I didnt because the S7 gave me a reason not to The glass shatters way to easily Other than that it is an amazing product Ive had this phone for a few weeks now There are positives and negatives For the good its very simple to learn and use The interface is fast acting And the camera is very sharp  clear as well
Now the bad  I have had a few glitches with it already for instance sometimes the screen doesnt accurately respond to where I touch ie keyboard or Internet surfing It also loves to randomly pause in the middle of a song when Im listening to the music player Just the other day the flashlight app drained my battery even though it wasnt open I had to force close the app 3 times before the phone actually accepted my command Finally the autocorrect is really annoying Its choice of words to correct to are so off the wall its like somebody programmed it to be ridiculous I love my phone because Im really not a techy and its super easy to use BUT I can use all of the features and apps that I couldnt on my old phone Having a lot of fun with it Bought 2 weeks ago battery life is great along with pictures This is my 4th Galaxy phone and just as all of those before this is an amazing phone NEXT TRIP THROUGH THE GALAXY LEADS TO EXCELLENT ADVENTURES Good battery life great camera Very happy with my phone Just got my S7 a week ago replaced an S6 so the transition was practically seamless Have enjoyed using the S7 the past week Ive had the phone now for 2 weeks and I love how easy it is to use and the platform it runs on I also really like all the added features However the battery is absolutely terrible It doesnt even last a whole day with medium usage So happy that I picked this phone I bought the S7 about a week ago and have had many many problems since I bought it  Ive been back to the store 3 times to resolve problems and still have things that dont seem to be working  I want my S5 back I dont like it at all too small no comparison to Note 5 Awesome phone best Samsung ever I have just upgraded from a Note 4 to this phone and I love it but there are just a few tweaks to the design that would make this phone an epic phone 

Please bring back the removable battery This is one of the reasons that I Kept my Note 4 for so long

I appreciate the fact that you have brought back the micro SD card for storage but the access to files stored there is much more cumbersome on this phone than on my Note 4 

Please make the 64 and a 128gb versions available here in the USA It sucks to be stuck with the 32gb version here in the biggest market you have Or you could allow the use of the micro SD card to augment the limited internal system ram and memory we are stuck with here in the USA 

The battery life is not as good as it should be for this price point I am a power user who likes to be online all day and with the screen brightness all the way up I end up having to recharge this phone 24 times a day Its like having a landline phone again I would bet that you could make a version for power hungry users that would have a 10000mah battery in it instead of having to buy bulky external charging cases or battery packs

Please put FRONT FIRING premium sound on this phone the sound is very lackluster 

Please replace touch wiz with a faster responding and less bloated interface 

Finally it is time to make a version with 16gb or larger ram since many of us use this phone in place of a laptop 

Having said all of the above I feel that this phone has an amazing camera screen and many very useful and cool advanced features I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a cutting edge phone Some background first I have had to switch between Apple products and Android phones several times since the advent of the smartphone I have to use a iPhone for work and had the Apple iPhone 6 a few weeks ago Overall that phone was OK Primarily I used it to manage my 3200  songs I purchased via iTunes way back when Apple has had a lock on people because of their music library having DME But I am sick of their phones Their products never evolve and barely come close to what is being offered in Android OS based phones 

I switched back to Samsung with the Galaxy 7 Edge after seeing one of my colleagues using hers I love this phone The design is elegant the screen is beautiful and sleek The new Android OS Marshmallow offers so much more customization than what Apple can ever hope to offer with their very conservative and staid interface The wireless charging is a feature you can only dream to have in an Apple product and yet Samsung has been offering this for a while now Samsung pay is even accepted at more locations than Apple Pay so I havent had to use my debit card in a while 

The only con is that the hard Onyx Black shell while beautiful to look at is a skin oilmagnet and is hard to keep clean So I bought a clear silicon case so I can still admire the looks of the phone while still being able to protect it 

I cant say enough about this product If you are thinking about switching  DO IT You wont regret it This is my 3rd Galaxy phone I started out with the S4 went to the S5 skipped the S6 and went for the S7 Edge

Being used to a nonedge phone it is taking me a very long time to remember which apps I have installed on the edge of my EDGE and personally I think its a little bit of overkill as I was able to launch all of my programs from a flat screen phone just as quickly That is probably due to the fact that I took the time to group my apps on each page Im also not a big fan of folders so it was very easy to find them

That being said the screen is wonderfully large and clear The camera is incredible and takes amazing pictures I love the fact that they went back to allowing micro sd cards Im used to being able to remove the battery but thats not a big deal 

Overall its a great phone If you want to try the latest and greatest then this phone is for you If you are as comfortable with a flat screen phone as I was save yourself a few dollars and go with the flat screen S7 Its best and user friendly phone so far from Samsung Battery lfe much better than my s great features love the phone 2 phones must be Worst phone ever dropped calls continuously voice fades in  out no matter where I am at Austin TX I should not be getting dropped calls no excuses Above everything else on this phone I love the battery life My old galaxy S would have to be charged a couple times during the day to last until bedtime Havent had to charge this phone and still have between 30 and 40 battery life at the end of the day Amazing Camera is phenomenal also This is one of the top 3 phones Ive owned The fingerprint technology has come a long way and is nearly flawless Never drop calls I got the gold version and it really pops Love it Its also a feature rich phone and Id say this phone and the s7 edge are your best bets for a quality reliable phone I traded in my note 4 for the s 7 and it is much faster I love the Galaxy S7 I had an Galaxy S5 and I love how easy it was to transfer all of my apps and info I love the split screen and the new style its very sleek I bought it three weeks ago it work great I updated my phone since my phone was 3 years old and not holding a charge very well I have had my new phone 1 week and I feel like my old phone held a charge just as well I am on vacation and cant do much before losing charge I have to only use it in emergency is what I feel like I have always had iphones but decided to give Samsung a try I love all the features of this phone save and except the problems I am experiencing with group messaging with iphone users
There has to be a better way to communicate with iphone users 

LOVE my charging station its awesome LOVE the camera on this phone LOVE all the apps

Highly recommend this phone even with the small issues I am having The phone is not  as good as they advertise  he Camara is better that my old Motorola    but for my utilities  for me is better Motorola Still learning about all the new features but so far very impressed I upgraded a Note 4 and got the Galaxy 7 The camera is fantastic both front and rear facing Easy to learn and set up Samsung has delivered again on a top notch product Ive never been disappointed with Samsung products My son and I both got the S7 When he runs the phone calls 911 by itselfHe bought the S7 active
I do like the s7 I have a 7 in tablet from a few years ago and the operating system it much better We both had S3 phones Mine died and went to get a new phone We are both old folks so we like to keep stuff simple I ended up with a S7 After using it a few hours I was so impressed I upgraded the wifes S3 to a S7 This phone is so easy to use us old folks can do it We use a high dollar camera but this phone camera matches it Everything about the phone is awesome I find myself using this more than my laptop It is fast and smooth Get one of these and you will be pleased This phone is light weight and fits in your pocket perfectly Has a wide variety of accessiories and attachments The only part i think they could work on is the screen Its is an s7 edge and the screen is to fragile It cracks to easy in my opinion and others i have heardl The edge has no real functional value It doesnt reduce steps for tasks It is the same number of steps It really only can reduce clutter on the main screens By holding the device in one hand  touching the edge just to hold the phone interferes with desired touch gestures and scrolling This is the best product i ever used Really  This phone is different from other phones it has sleek designs amazing designs that will be the new future of technology and is looked as the future of phones it is fast and amazing and I would Recommend this to people The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is by far one of the best phones I have owned It is lightweight and powerful The Edge feature helps me see notications without having to go to my phone and sign in The water resistant design is great if you like the outdoors work in the outdoors or are clumbsy near the water Overall the device is great however it does have its flaws The wifi on the device is lacking It is consistantly inconsistent for its connection I am blowing through my data plan instead of being able to utilize my wifi connection at home work or on public hotspots I beleive it can be addressed by a simple software update which hasnt been made available yet I like the device and I Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great android device Great upgrade from my S4 its fast has decent battery life and has some nice features I really like the fingerprint scanning  and the interface A lot of my work is done on social media This phones battery lasts a long time The pictures are beautiful and I love all of the different options while taking pictures I am also a triathlete and its awesome that I can capture a lot of my training moments with this phone because its waterproof q Im enjoying this phone but am still getting used to it  For some reason the keyboard seems smaller or w a different sensitivity  I am constantly making typos and that was not the case on the last phone Like it much better than the Note4 Easier to hold and text on PROS Screen size Processor Camera Craftsmanship

CONS No longer able to active Silent Mode with volume down vibrate is the only option IR Beam removed Default Samsung Music Player removed Google Play Music only preinstalled music app

PREVIOUS DEVICE Samsung Note 4 I like the additional features of my Samsung over my previous smartphone  Im slowly making the transition but I can tell that I will be able to use it even more as a minicomputer while Im on the go Fast easy to use Keeps me organized and updated with all of my contacts and tasks Would definitely recommend My new Galaxy S7 looks great and feel good in your hand After only a day with it I dropped it and it landed face down I thought surely it had shattered but was happily surprised to see the screen scratch free once I picked it up so its good to know it can take a fallor two The design is very sleek and beautiful although the battery life is on the short size and the speaker during calls isnt as loud as Id like it to be Overall a pretty good device Im not a must have the latest greatest kind of guy Just want things to function smoothly without the need to be a technical genius Like this much better than my work phone apple6 Samsung products are user very user friendly I have had many Samsung phones as well as tablets I love all the features this product came with Although it is very fragile the performance of the phone is outstanding Had it less than a week love it Upgraded from galaxy 4 Just bought the phone and still learning the features Bought two Samsung Galaxy S7 the day it came out June 30th one for my wife to replace her S3 and the other to replace my Note II We are very impressed the the product feels like a premium product amazing camera high detailed display and fast performance responsive and fast downloads  LTE The phone feels greatnot to big or bulky in the hand unlike my previous Note II Metal framing and glass one both sides give it a solid feel unlike the plastic backing with our previous models The camera takes very detailed pictures even in low light situations my Note II was horrendous The quick launch helps to capture the moment unlike our previous phones which took too long to launch the camera app and missed capturing a lot of moments with our kids or family or would end up with smears of events as pictures The display is quite detailed for picture videos or gaming Switching between apps or surfing the web is very fastrarely having any stuttering or lag My wife and I are very happy with our purchase Best of all we can take it to any cellular service provider since it is unlockedcurrently using US Cellular but can switch if our needs changenot being locked in to one carrier is great I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Have had it for a couple of weeks Received an Otter Defender case Plenty sturdy Wraps on and off rather easily Main thing It protects the phone all around Phone and texting seem easier Improvements in access And notifications Took it to Rodin exhibit at Peabody Essex Museum Salem MA Photo attached Its a great smartphone fast easy for useGreat Performance I have had my new phone and have found it east to move into and add what I had on my old phone i bought this phone 3 weeks ago and i am really happy witg it I transitioned from iPhone to Samsung It has been a great experience I like my new Samsung Galaxy S7 very much The design is well thought out The quality of construction is top notch The screen is bright The Verizon cell reception is very good My only complaint is battery life On a light use day everything is great But on moderate to heavy use days I need to recharge the phone to finish the day Always a Samsung loverwouldnt switch to another phone   I constantly keep finding new things and new features that the phone is capable of doinggreat device Came from an iPhone 6 to the Galaxy 7 Edge and love it Had a question about storage pop up that kept coming up while using Google contacted Samsung operator fixed the problem through chat line and remote access Super service This phone is wonderful so far It has awesome features and I love the bright screen the camera is clear and crisp Purchased this phone 2 weeks ago I really enjoyed this upgrade from the S4 I had previously Love my S7 edge just wished it was a little bigger Switched over to Samsung a few years ago and have never been happier And now i have a new s7 and I am amazed at all of the features on this phone Samsung just keeps getting better and better I love this phone I sold my IPhone 6s that I bought in Jan 2016 I had to have this phone Love everything about it This phone is a must This phone does way more than I need it to do and everything thing it is supposed to do By far the best phone on the market Period My previous phone was the Samsung S4 This phone is SO great is every respect The battery lasts foreverthe phone never gets hotthe phone is great in almost walking you through setting things up I am so happy And it is a beautiful phone as a bonus Lol Happy with my device Very user friendly and easy to use I read that the battery was much better on the S7 than the S6 and I am finding that not to be trueI am very dissappointed with the battery life I bought this phone less than 14days and I am having 2nd doubtshift about itit keep freezing up on me and powering down Very glad I did Loved the S5 S7 is even better smoother Personally I dont like that the headphone jack is on the bottom Battery is much worse than the s5 and the reception seems to be worse than the s5  Not sure exactly what they improved on but so far it has escaped me I like it Better than my S5 Havent had any issues with s7 was skeptical after reading negative reviews but glad I made the purchase Pretty to look at but its a little awkward  to handle   The power button is too low on  the side  so I am always accidentally turning the screen off The device  is top heavy  and drops out  of my hands uunexpectedly Otherwise not a bad phone  The galaxy 7 really hasorry no differences from the 6 other than the positioning of the lock button and camera so that I have to purchase a new case now I bought the phone a week ago last Thursday  After a few days I was having issues  Everyone said I was breaking up when I spoke with them on the phone  While at work I kept getting a network error  I was disappointed  I was going to go back to the store  Then I had a bright idea  When in doubt reboot  That took care of everything  My only complaint is that I lost my ringtones  And trying to rebuy them is difficult  A few things are different from my S3  Overall I really like my new phone great features  and easy to use Unable to do anything with this runs slow I got this a few weeks ago and like it for the most part Cant use Google maps It tells me Im off line when Im not on WiFi The longer I have it the  more  I like it I have to say that I had some hesitation on getting a new phone I didnt want to start all over With that said I know love my new Samsung It was so easy to use I have more options now that I didnt have in the past Its britter the pictures it takes are fantastic The quality is great I would definitely recommend this product In fact I did Thank you Samsung I like my phone Still learning how to use it Good looking phone By far the best phone I have ever had I am really hard on phones do to my work and seems like this will better then any other android I have had so far It operates fast takes great pictures well I could go on forever But I would recommend this phone to everyone I love my phone it is awesome the camera is the best and I can do different things at one time I love the gaming option Im still getting to know the S7 but I pretty much like it all so far  Ive been w Verizon a while  like their Customer service coverage and plans  

PS the use of the nick name is me  WHY MUST I come up with another one every review This is probably the nicest most featurerich phone Ive ever had Easy reliable and with a lot of cool stuff both for productivity and entertainment I have had a lot of different Samsung products but this is my first smartphone from them I like it enough that I will most likely upgrade when Im able next year to the newest Galaxy phone Nice phone great features battery life is very good I love the speed and the features Would recommend this item all my family and friends nice I traded in my iPhone 6s and it was the best decision ever The Samsung lets you hacmve more freedom to do so much more Since combining the Galaxy 7 Edge Gear VR and the international version of Gear 360 I have a cohesive platform for documenting life in high resolution photos with an assortment of editing tools virtual images 360 images and now i can create sphere images and sphere videos with an assortment of editing tools Using the Gear VR with the Gear 360 Action Director allows me to think and create differently about how my documenting and life logging can enhance the viewers immersive experience From the Swiss Alps Miamis blue beaches Paris New York and into surgical suites I am finally experiencing the synergistic benefits that have finally become available to the average citizen If you said the average citizen would have these abilities in the 1980s no one would have believed you Having so many ways to communicate isnt to shabby either battery life is good internet is fast camera is excellent love the improved zoom feature I love my new Samsung 7 Its actually better then my old note 3 Got this July 4 and I love it I like the features and design It is the best phone on the market I love this phone does anything goes and everything I need plus I have had this phone since the day it was released and I absolutely love it Get this phone and I promise you will not be disappointed Screen is so close to hand and causes mistyping  seems more sensitive  Hate blue bubble gizmo All of a sudden auto punctuation  disappeared
Like back button  Like screen very much  and camera It was time for an upgrade and the Galaxy 7 fit the bill I was using a Galaxy 6 for a year and though I liked it I did feel constrained with only the 32 GB onboard with no way to expand  Now with the 7s ability to add a microSD the storage is essentially limitless  Frankly I think the phone rocks I had the galaxy s6 before the s7 hands down I love the features and performance of the galaxy s7 The camera is the best on any smartphone I have seen This phone was purchased for a 57 yo man who for the past year has kept his wife from using their Tab Pro 122 tablet its hers Now I am thankful for that He immediately knew how to use the platform Great I didnt have to train him at all only making minor adjustments to the apps Hands down the best phone along with my Note5 we have invested in Thank you Samsung for raising the bar I only have one question about why my Note5 has a better camera Why couldnt it be on the S7 Other than that happy happy happy This phone is great I upgraded from a note 4 which was a good phone but the battery life stunk This phone has great battery life fast processing speed plenty of memory and also can hold an SD card It takes amazing pictures and very quickly The sound quality is great from the phone speaker I wouldnt mind a slightly bigger screen and getting used to not bumping the edges takes some time but all in all I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a multitasking tool worth its value Great phone everything great however battery is no better older models I am extremely pleased with the new cell phone Its features are exactly what I need to keep up with not only news sports but other features that keep my life in order It seems like we can keep everything we need on one phone Best phone I have ever used or have picked up Great features and great performance Upgraded from an s4 Better display nice bright screen a lot more storage space and much faster Also LOVE the wireless fast charging Ive had my phone for over a week and I love it I was in need of an update from my flip phone so I could have one device for my phone and portable music Samsung Galaxy S7 is way more than that Its a bit confusing to get used to the multitude of settings  apps that come standard at least for someone who just purchased his first smart phone Some printed manuals  documentations for some basics would be very helpful In the past I have never been a huge fan of the Touchwiz and Samsung preinstalled apps and some of the older designs of the Galaxy phones However with this phone they hit it out of the park

The phone itself looks and feels premium The batter lasts forever and will make it though an entire day of constant usage The screen is gorgeous and the curve is beautiful 

The preinstalled software on the phone is not excessive and the Samsung apps work EXTREMELY well now I need to applaud them on listening to consumers and delivering a great experience There hasnt been any lag as far as Ive noticed over the weeks of use so far and every app runs incredibly smooth

Ultimately Im loving everything about this phone and can see myself buying Samsung phones from now on if they keep up with this amazing quality Well done Samsung Love my new phone I had the Note 5 and was thinking of waiting for the Note 7 in September but decided to go with the smaller and waterproof S7 Great camera great new features and pretty much all the stuff I have on the Note 5 is in this phone if not more Havent fully explored the phone but the first few weeks have been great After long last I have finally joined TeamSamsung and its been the best experience I simple LOVE ALL of my Samsung devices especially my S7 Edge I am most impressed with the camera quality and its advanced features being a photographer these features were very important to me and I can say that I have no regrets in my decision hard to understand for rookies very complicated Its all good except for the Do not disturb schedule that is very limited  Needs better software in that department I have purchased many phones over the years I am very much impressed with my new Galaxy S7 edge So far so good Love the quality of pictures taken Also got the S2 watch to go along with it and am very impressed It take lovely pictures and movies look great on its screen Great phone wish I had two Cam get any better then this Easy to use and figure out even if you are not tech savey This is a fast phone and seems very good Still getting used to some of the app changes but overall very happy I have only had S7 for a week but I was so tired of charging my S5 during the day I was ready for a change I have not come close to needing a charge on the S7 during the day I charge it over night and it lasts all day Its fast responsive and fun to use She loves Samsung Says shell never switch The galaxy s7 is one of the best phones i have ever had It has great features and the latest operating system and it a great phone to have I would reccomend this phone to anyone This phone is very easy to learn and also easy to navigatelove the features Hands down the best smartphone I have ever owned Easy to customize Easy to navigate Everything is great Only con is it smudges badly Constantly cleaning it if not in its case I love the new S7 Edge Its super easy to use Loaded with tons of features and the camera is amazing You should definitely get one Now that the battery issue is fixed this phone is what the s6 should have been The sound is great even without headphones Screen resolution is to notch Love the phone and all the features And the photos are amazing Nice and handy like the design and performance specially camera I am so happy with my choice on getting the Samsung Galaxy 7edge I have always had an iphone and it was cool but nothing the the eye popping WOW factor of this I call it  my sexy phone because that is the only word I can think of in describing its looks I judged this book by the cover and it paid off in spades The amount of RD that went into this device must have been staggering because they overlooked nothing When I am asked about regrets on getting the 7edge I become mute as I have none to say Thank you team Samsung I have a Galaxy S4 S5 and S7 at this time I have also owned the galaxy S3 As far as I am concerned Samsung makes the best phones around The Galaxy S7 does not disappoint by far the best phone I have ever used Thanks Samsung Overall S7 isnt a lot different from my last phone S5 I am a bit surprised Samsung didnt think outside the box honestly Overall I like the phone but one big issue I have is it gets hot VERY quickly at times I do enjoy the VR goggles and look forward to advanced functionality there Large display long battery life great camera like the edge features the s7 is the best phone I have ever hadIt does everything faster clearer and better pictures are crystal clear on first try hardly ever need to fix after I shoot it display is also clear and crisp I briefly considered switching to an iPhone from the S4 I had I am SO glad I did not The camera was the main reason I considered it This camera is AMAZING and I am a Samsung fan for life I would like to have some kind of instructions on how to use this new phone that I have Im completely lost on what it can do  I need to know how all the apps work and how to send voice messages and how to get the most out of my expensive phone Absolutely love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 It has all the features of previous galaxy phones plus more I am learning more about my phone every day It charges so much faster and holds a charge longer The pictures from the phone look like professional pictures and are so clear and crisp I highly recommend this phone I was having a problem with my old phone and its battery losing charge within 12 hrs I am an average user I was told that this phone would solve my battery it didnt I last maybe 15 hrs I am not happy Upgraded from S6 only because of issue with charging port malfunction Its been great really enjoying the video chat function Excited that its waterproof Have had for 2 weeks  No issues so far I think all of the features are great and so easy to work with  There are not enough words to express how wonderful I feel this product is It was time for my 2 year upgrade so I selected the Galaxy S7 because I was afraid the Edge would be too fragile or complicated I was searching for an upgrade to my S4 that wouldnt require me to learn a bunch of new stuff Im very pleased with the S7 The performance is very good
Takes great photos and videos Awesome phone great camera lot of great features very fast Phone has bad reception and drops call frequently I love the functionality of the phone and it has great performance Maybe its slightly personal preference but there are some design elements that bother me a little bit The screen is very close to the edge of the phone and I find myself touching things on the screen with part of my hand thats holding the phone when I dont mean to Overall outstanding phone Love that you added the memory card expansion slot Love that its water proof Only issue I have is that the batter cannot remove which gives me concern because that was the issue with my s6 My previous s6 broke due to over heated battery Other than that great phone Wow this phone is GREAT  best one I have ever had  easy to use for this 66 year old guy  display is very clear and the camera is something else  battery life is very good  cant beat it for the price I love how this product is waterproof My husband accidentally went swimming with his Samsung Galaxy original phone and it was ruined Now if this happens again its safe I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy s7 after playing with the phones in store I absolutely love how easy it was to transfer everything from my old phone and this phone is really easy to use Great additional features beautiful display excellent battery life especially considering how much I use my phone Excellent sound quality even in a case for both music and phone calls Best feature for me is the camera with all the extras and beautiful picture quality The Samsung Edge is everything I expected it to be and more I love the camera features The battery life is excellent for the operations Highly recommended Love this phone Great camera Its been just a little more than a week and were in love  Love this phone Best Galaxy yet by far I got it about a week ago and it works wonderfully I have tried a few different carriers and Verizon seems to be one of the better ones This phone loads things in a blink of an eye and responds faster then any other phone Ive experienced I have had this phone for a week and so far I love it The only downside is the battery life I have to charge it every dayand I dont even use it a lot everyday I miss some of the features of the S5 Air View screenshot button but I do like the speed camera and screen on the S7 Edge Im a little worried about the fragility I purchased this phone a week ago and was very leery of transitioning from my old phone  Set up was a breeze all apps transferred and installed in no time  Learning the new phone was just as quick and easy  Very glad I chose this phone The phone is beautiful and it is big but often times I find it difficult to use because the area around the edge doesnt always respond with the right letter or number Its been so fun discovering all the fun stuff this phone can do At first the difference from my old HTC phone drove me nuts But as Im learning more about it and all the extra things I can do I just love this phone I loved my S6 so much I was scared to move on to the S7 but definitely glad I did it is definitely improved I love how easy the phone is to use fits great in my hands and the gold is pretty This phone is great Battery life is better than my old phone Picture is great The photos you can take with the camera feature are better than my actual camera I have recommended it to several people It has not frozen at all Theread is usually no delay with downloads This is an awesome phone Quite an upgrade from the S4 Some features take some getting used to The only annoyance I have so far is the visual voicemail prompts wont go away Its not something Im going to pay extra for and I havent yet figured out how to get the phone to stop prompting me for it Other than this very pleased I switched from iOS to Android with this purchase and have no complaints so far Performance usability battery everything is looking good as of now Always on is one feature that stands out I really like it I bought the phone for a better camera but I realized that zoomed in photos dont look too good I had a blast enjoyed the workers and my phone and tablet Product is easy to use and easy to learn its wonderful features Good buy easy transition  from old phone to new excellent phone its has great features realistic color bright display I traded an iPhone 6s plus for this galaxy s7 edge and I have to say that the galaxy beats the iPhone in almost every way Apps seem more stable on ios than on android Screen on galaxy beats beats iPhones hands down Size of galaxy is more manageable than iPhone plus Back glass on galaxy is worrisome due to possible breakag  The edge features on the galaxy are pretty useless whereas the 3d touch on iPhone 6s is pretty useful Galaxy has decent battery life and wireless charging built in is a bonus Camera on galaxy is super fast compared to iPhone which is important for catching quick photos Edge screen on galaxy is easy to accidently tap opening apps without meaning to Amazing and fast phone great features Love the big screen If the design wasnt already enough I say you should buy itThe curved screen has useful features to come with itThe performance isnt bad at all its really good for gamers since it has game tools to truely get that gaming experience Overall I say its worth getting Glad I chose this phone I really like the Samsung Galaxy S7 32GB Im extremely excited about this phone everything Ive tryd to do with this phone has been a very satisfying I can not say enough great things about this phone I normally dont do reviews but this phone is worth telling people who are interested in getting this phone you wont be disappointed Unless your impossible to please you cant go wrong getting this one Im interested in winning the tabletbecause if it is good as this phone then Samsung will have a loyal customer for the rest of my life  Psychological really need the tablet thanks I bought this about a week ago and have not had time to fully play with it This phone is everything Stylish easy to use awesome features couple that with a great case and your on a role I have owned my phone for 8 days and have so appreciated being able to check email or Facebook without the phone freezing crashing or rebooting itself I love the way the screen goes dark when I put the phone in my purse and was deeply impressed when I went in a tunnel while driving yesterday and the screen instantly compensated its lighting I am looking forward to learning more about the features in the class I am taking at the Verizon store tomorrow Being able to use a 128gb SD Card in the phone allows me to store all my pictures and documents so that I always have them with me even with a wireless connection Battery life is great I am able to charge it fast all the way full Processor is really fast and never get hangup like I did with other models The water resistant feature is great knowing it wont be easily damaged and is a great value I love this version of Galaxy  It is easy to use with nice features Its an ok phone Hard to type on Love the phone and service is better than last carrier I upgraded from a Galaxy 5S I love the increased functionality and specialty the battery life I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy S7 Over all I am very happy with it I like the new themes to change the look of the phone I also like the new feature when you are doing something on your phone and a text comes in you get a little text box at the top of your screen and you can quickly reply and go back to do what you were doing I think the only feature that I am missing from my S5 is the revolving screens S5 goes all the way around and the S7 it stops at the ends no continuing at the begining This is my first Samsung phone and I love it My kids have been trying to get me to switch for years This wont be my last Samsung Features are great and easy to navigate So I bought this about two weeks ago  Finally upgrading away from my lovely S4 which to this day was still running as it had when I first got it years ago  It took me forever to get away from what to me was a perfect phone but I did and I am happier for it  Battery life is exceptional phone responds well clear audio is everything I was hoping it would be I bought this 2 weeks ago  Only I dont like is the short battery life I love my phone from the way it notifies you of text messages or issues My only gripe is the volume needs to go to eleven a quote from spinal tap the movie but it is hard to complain when this phone is so good I bought this about 2weeks ago and have not been sorry yet Great this best phone light good to handle battery savers Its an absolutely amazing fone in everywayI would recommend it to everyone I love my new phone Enjoying all the features Operates smoothly and precisely There are also many improvements over previous versions The colors are vivid and the display is easy to read A very logical format makes downloading a breeze the browser is faster than previous models too Im enjoying my phone
Thanks Beat my last phone the Mega by a mile Technology over the top I really appreciate and enjoy all my features on this phone Im always finding more information about this phone Im so glad that I brought my phone Great phone Slim easy to handle fits in pocket and great display The best feature is the Samsung Pay I love it No need to get your wallet out no need to completely unlock the phone and it actually works almost everywhere Glad I made this purchase Battery lasts for the entire day Wireless charging rocks The product is great easy to use and the features are great This is the best phone I have ever owned The only thing I recommend would be for Samsung to add dual front facing speakers The ringer is sometimes difficult to hear if the phone is in my pocket Samsung Pay is excellent Ill be glad when more banks support it I finally upgraded from my Galaxy S5 and man am I happy The speed and camera are the two biggest features that I really like The improve fingerprint scanner and better battery life are great too I cant wait to see how they improve this for the next version Good phone overall and very functional but the screen broke on the first drop Which was disappointing considering Ive had the phone for 2 weeks only Absolutely my favorite phone Ive every had Ive never had this good of luck with other companies but Samsung has once again amazed me beyond all hopes Ok i love this phone Its so easy to use has tons of features is very fast I dont know if it is ME or the phone but things I learned to manage on my previous phone dont work the same way For example I used to be able to access voice mail by clicking on the icon now if it hasnt selftranscribed into a text message I cant seem to access it New devices always work at its peak  In previous devices the more apps you install the slower the device becomes  This new S7 will be tested Only downside has been getting contacts transfered from my old s5 to the new s7
Really like the s7 otherwise Only had the phone for a week and Im still adjusting to it But so far its a nice upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S5 The S7 is fast  and has so many features which Ive still got to learn The camera is rated excellent and I agree Ease of transition to new phone I purchased this a week ago and LOVE it Ive had it a week and it is too complicated and all the little icons representing different apps and options do not resemble in any way what they do  So far hating the upgrade Had the phone for two weeks  Nice Switched from 5 to 7  Applications slightly different  Battery is the best feature  Honestly thinking about going back to 5 I love Samsung products thats why I stuck with buying them The Samsung Galaxy S7 is great like the rest of their other products Only had it a week so far I love it user friendly great camera and it is large enough without over doing it I upgraded from the S6 edge to the S7 and I couldnt be happier I love the look feel and features of the phone The phone itself is very responsive I couldnt ask for more I have a S5 which I love but I love this S7 even moreEasy to use great appsfeatures and love the platinum gold color Everything awesome  What I love theverything most is that you can put an SD card in I bought this phone after my Samsung Galaxy 6 got dropped in water I really like it Its pretty and its water resistent  Easy to use and fast I have had the Galaxy S7 for about a week  Its a great phone  I love the camera  Im still learning all the extra features Its user friendly Ive only had it a week tomorrow  Havent learned everything there is to learn about it yet Had the s5 for lil over 2yrs n was time for upgradethe s7 is easy transition I feel they r so similar  just the s7 has more memory really enjoying it Great phone and features So far this phone has been the best I have ever had Processor is fast and doesnt slow down even with multiple apps running on the background Camera shoots great pictures and the screen image is bright and very sharp the only thing is this briefing you cant get rid of and certain icon that you have to keep on display
so far no probllems This is the second time the screen shatters from a short distance fall The first time it fell out of my pocket when I was getting up the entire back shattered The second time it also fell out of my pocket while getting up the front screen shattered in both cases the drop was less than 2 feet high The phone is good but the structure is very weak The screen shatters from the least distance drops My son has an iPad and throws it and nothing happens to it 

Bottom line nice phone bad structure But its hard to find a tempered glass screen protector What would you recommend It was an easy transition from the Galaxy S5  The battery life leaves a lot to be desired  Does not last as long as I expected it should A few apps did not transfer bit they were easily downloaded since the app store saved which apps I had previously installed I have been a Samsung owner for years with the Note 2 and Note 4 I like the Spen but I thought I would try the Galaxy S7 Edge with my upgrade I am sure the soon to be released Note 7 will be an outstanding product But the S7 Edge has exceeded my expectations I can take onthego notes with a voice to text app The Edge gives me quick access to my calendar weather and my all important stock quotes The phone and messaging are great and Ive used the camera to take many many great pictures of my beautiful new greatgranddaughter I also own two different sizes of Samsung tablets a Samsung color laser printer a Samsung wireless hard drive and a Samsung microwave I am a true Samsung fan and I can always rely on Samsung products to deliver just what I want and satisfy my communication computing and appliance needs Upgraded from S5 to S7 didnt take long to get use to love it wish there were more otterbox options though I am adjusting to the different features from my old phone some are better than others I am finding some features I like of my old phone are still there but I just have to figure out how to use them I love this phone 
I really need to understand all it is capable of
I would love talk to text I had a choice when my S4 was destroyed in a fall I could buy a cheap replacement phone or step up to a new S7 I thought about how I use the tech available to me and found that I do the majority of my work when away from my desk on my phone 

So now with the new S7Edge Im leaving the laptop in its case more and conducting on the go business directly from my phone So much easier

It is a big phone but look at it more as a small tablet that also makes phone calls and its perfect size And the new fast charging feature is a huge benefit Great upgrade  The camera alone is worth it New pics are amazing Nice battery pics  video Really like the extra micro SD storage Just bought the Samsung S 7 not all that impressed not much difference at all from the S 5 This phone works very well and is easy to use I think the sound quality on phone calls is good too The additional features of this phone are too numerous to mention I am still discovering things this phone can do

I am especially happy that it will take a high capacity micro sd card I have 128gb in it now but think I remember reading it can go twice that high Better check that one out for sure if you plan to use more than 128gb

As far as design is concerned I dont like the little drawer that the sd card fits into It has to be opened with a separate key and the drawer comes completely out The sim card sits on the drawer and can easily fall off while you are removing or installing the micro sd card That design could use lots of improvement in my opinion On the plus side once the drawer is pushed closed it fits flush with the side of the phone and cannot be opened accidentally 5 days after having phone I had dropped it accidentally at max a foot from floor and screen cracked all over Of course making phone non water resistant Warranty you get from Samsung with phone doesnt cover 

As far as the features using and navigation is great I really enjoy new apps and camera options and settings 

Highly suggest case and screen protector right away Phone is very slick and slips out places very easily This phone has incredible speed The camera is clear and photos have lot of detail Love how Samsung has let us handle phone app permissions I am truly an android forever fan and I love when the newest Galaxy S comes out and I cant wait to get it but I have to say Im finding it a little hard to get used to the edge but its getting easier I think I wouldve been better off with the s7 instead of the s7 edge But overall i love my phone Many of the apps had to be uninstalled  reinstalled I still dont have my ring tones or ring back tones Emails are difficult to delete Personally this is my first phone I have bought my self and aside from other phones in the past it was well worth it I love the curved screen what I once that was a huge flaw turns out its rather useful The display is beautiful and of course android allows me to make this device my own and Im in love I love the phone androids are the best easy to use and very helpful just got recently my other phone was damaged in an accident love samsung The phone is good but should have more native apps This is a good quality phone it has a lot of features and I love it I absolutely love this phone Its the best one Ive ever had This phone has exceeded all my expectations Its fast light weight and provides everything I need and more My last carrier wasnt the best for service but I could send multiple pics via txt at one time With Verizon after visiting the store I have to send multiple txt when sending multiple pictures I love the image of the pictures I recommend to buy one of this As you would expect the Galaxy S7 edge comes packed with other tech including a fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor Im really impressed with the camera and although its one of the best on a phone its perhaps not as good in the dark as Samsung makes out Good battery life adaptive fast charging and wireless charging is quite amazing 3600 mAh Its more a software feature but the Galaxy S7 edge display is always on should you want it to be This means you can get basic information without even laying a finger on the phone

 The best android smartphone in 2016 This phone is amazing in every way I can think I just upgraded the memory from 32GB that came with it to 232GB by adding a 200GB MicroSD card I came from a Lumia 929 which I liked but this phone is superior I love the customizable UI customizable themes just everything about how the phone works and Android Marshmallow is an amazing OS My iphone friends are envious their iphone pale by comparison I brought it for my wife and when I set it up for her I liked it so much that I had to get one for myself I love the phone it has great graphics and battery The phone is fast the display is beautiful and photos taken on this phone are beautiful Its a little larger than my previous phone but not so much as to be unwieldy I am totally impressed by the performance and features I subtracted 1 star from the design category because while I like the slim body and the wrap around screen its the s7 edge it makes it a little too easy for it to slip from your grasp A case is a must with the case I have no problem holding on to it I definitely recommend this phone I am so happy to upgrade our phones love them Ok I thought my S4 was sweet but this new S7 Edge had blown my mind There are so many cool options and functions that I could not name them all so I will focus on a few that I like 
First the camera huge upgrades in the Mb of both front and back lens the pictures look 4K so much definition 
Call quality is excellent even paired to mysync the calls are always easy to hear 
I have switched service from Tmobile to ATT so I am getting used to some of the changes and have a whole slew of new ATT apps to discover I find that with ATT I never get 4 bars of service even living near a bit city like Atlanta 
Battery life seems to be much longer than my old S4 I ran my S4 pretty hard then when I couldnt get a factory battery anymore I decided it was time to upgrade S7 is faster sharper and has better sound 2 things I dont like back is really slick and youll drop it for sure Buy a case Second the rep tells me that I will never kill the battery I dont believe it because they told me the same thing about my S4 and I killed it 3 charges a day is not good S7 battery is completely inaccessible Pros happy to get the micro SD slot Love the lowbatteryconsumption sleep screen and instant startup from there Also happy to have USB and headset plugs on same end instead of rotisserie style I purchased this phone for my cousin and he is loving it The phone has more features than we use in our day to day usage Bit pricy but worth the spend overall So easy to navigate I have been using the phone throughout the day and this phone impresses me every time The camera is simply amazing and the video recording blows me away I have tested the battery from a full charge and I have found that I am able to get through the day with my usage That is from 7AM to 8pm with 30 left for my battery Simply awesome and the water proof is just an added protection I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge
It feels great holding it its really fast the screen resolution and camera is amazing Easy to read news read a book or view videos S7 HAS ALL THE FEATURES I VALUE Having had the GalaxyS5 for the last 3 years I was somewhat expecting an improved what i already had  But this IS a entirely new phone One thing 
that is so improved is that it is so sensitive it seems to anticipate what I want to do The power and memory make my ideas feasible Im learning I will enjoy the gear I got with the phone thoroughly The longer lasting battery takes the tension out of finding myself without a plug I can only imagine what I will learn in the class I plan to attend But even now it is not a strange phone to me but a reliable friend Thanks Samsung What a great phone Enjoying the new phone and the fact that it is faster then my old phone Still learning things about it and it can be frustrating but all will be good once I fully understand it I like the size of this phone its not as huge as some of the newer smart phones  Interface is easy to use and learn no matter what phone you have before Best phone ever Recommend it to all my friends Battery life is much improved from Samsung Galaxy S4 Easy to use tutorials in phone are excellent references  Happy that I upgraded I waited 2 years to upgrade from my S5 to the new S7 edge and trust me it was worth the wait not saying the S6 wasnt a good phone but WOW I REALLY like the new S7

KUDOS to SAMSUNG keep up the good work looking forward to seeing your next endeavor of phones

Kindest Regards
S7 Edge owner I bought it a week ago and its way better than my old I phone I love gadgets and this is the best phone i have ever hadhas everything i need worth every penny Horrible service Phone was more expensive than buying it at other stores and my bill is too much  I have had iPhones for 7 years now and this time I wanted the Samsung Galaxy S7 So far I love everything about this phone It has amazing picture quality and great video quality as well It was very different switching from the IOS system to the Android but I have adapted to it very quickly I dont think I would go back to an iPhone after having this phone What a great phone This is the second Samsung Galaxy phone that I have owned and it is better than expected The Galaxy S7 edge is fast takes great pictures and has great battery life I would definitely recommend to anyone that may be on the fence I like everything about this phone The features are great and I really like that it is water resistent just in case I also really like the low light photo feature I miss the size of my Note 4 but this is a good midsized option Moving from the note to the galaxy I was a little bit hesitantskeptical But Im sold on the overall package I steered away from the note once it had to be purchased with built in memory vs SD card I just prefer having the external mount for numerous reasons so Galaxy it was Overall great function on this phone The interface and features are definitely driven to a more youthful clientele but in general theyre fun There are a few items which performance based are a little more clunky from an operations perspective but nothing major Im really pleased with this phone and I think most of the phone costs in general are inflated not specific to this particular phone The S7 Edge is an all around great phone The camera on it is very impressive My return to a Galaxy after a few different options Overall has been a great experience thus far Design is great although a little slippery without a case My main gripe would be the reversal of the back and recent apps buttons from where they sit on other Android devices I am very happy with this phone Easy to use fast sleek I LOVE this phone Loved my S5 but this phone is FANTABULOUS Seriously I didnt drink the Koolaid it is that awesome I usually dont write a review but if you are thinking about an Up Grade DO IT I just have couple days with it but  goes pretty good Still getting used to it but love it so far Its a great phone easy to use love the customization After being with an iPhone for lots of years I am very happy I decided to try out the Samsung S7 Recommend it to anyone This is an excellent phone with great features and apps well integrated into the phone Its more than just a phone Its an assistant and helps organize and keep track of everything for me Theres not any better out there love the camera i still havent figured out the fingerprint security thing yet love the new features especially the text messaging features Great and fast phone
Love the quality of the phone the color is great the camera is awesome Samsung has a great reputation with me I have a own Samsung cell phones for 8 years now I also own a 50 inch TV Samsung Galaxy 101 tablet 
I absolutely love Samsung for quality services and they always keep my products updated
Samsung loyal
Rod Best phone I have used ever Camera is awesome if you like to site see This phone has the best battery life Ive ever had on a cellular device The combination of fast charging and a long lasting battery is pefect for people who are always on the go I would definitely recommend buying it Samsung listened and added back in the Micro SD card slot

Battery life is excellent even while playing Pokemon Go

the only Cons i have are no removable battery  and the slight curve to the screen edge making it currently difficult to get a good quality screen protector without a gap on the edge Very happy and looking forward to using it overseas soon It is a little bit expensive but what isntbetter than my old phone Ive been very happy with everything this phone can do I could go on all day about this phone but to sum it up its the best of the best in every way right now It is the most beautiful All of the features Trump all other phones that it compares to I used to be an avid iphone user until I made the switch to the Galaxy s6 edge plus and now I have the galaxy s7 edge Wouldnt ever go back at this point This phone takes the best pictures That was the selling point for me but it also has everything else you need right at your fingertips Ive told my family and friends this is the phone you need and will want to have This has more than meet my expectations The quick charge is great and the charger to lay it on makes it greater There is a lot to learn about the phone and your email tips has helped I really enjoy the phone Ive had it for about a week and I like that my apps dont have any trouble running well I have been wanting this phone since it was first announced before the released date Now that I finally have it it is so totally worth the wait since I was in a contract before After the first week I had it I started to recommend it Everything is just perfect I definately do love the design It is fine and works well I have been an iPhone user for my business but wanted something different for my personal use The s7 Edge was my choice after reading many reviews It was the right choice Battery is so much better than previous Android based phones that I have had and the phone is very fast Beautiful screen and a wonderful camera I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very sleek fast and potent device I love all the features on my new phone  Ive had a couple of other brand phones in the past but was persuaded to try the Samsung S7  What a great phone  The only thing I miss is voice texting  Maybe I just havent found it yet I love Samsung Galaxy My last phone was an S5 and over 2yrs old and this battery doesnt last as long as that one Thats my biggest disappointment The guy at the store told meveryone it had a 27hr battery life Well yesterday I took it off the charger at 7am and didnt touch it at work until around 1 and it was already at 35 I love the look and the new features Got a week ago I love Got this phone for my wife however after using a Note phone she has had a problem adjusting to the smaller size  I just traded with her so she is using the Note 4 and I am using the S7  I dont know why everyone is having such a problem with their S7 but mine is working great and I think it is working at the best it can for me  If there were to be anything at all I would want is to be able to use the S Pen from the Note on it for better writing control  I have no problem using the old type stylist with my S7  I will continue to enjoy using it till Samsung develops a phone  or Note that is better and is worth the money I work so hard for LOL Took a little getting used to large but I now prefer it over the IPHONE Has more features and very user friendly Should have switched long ago I have only had this phone a few weeks and my second smart phone I am impressed with the S7 I upgraded to it online and it arrived on time and in great shape It was easy to set up and is so far proving to be easy to use I cannot even get few hours of talk time The quick charger is the only way to use it and increase the battery level at the same time Do not purchase this phone unless you want to be an AC outlet addict The functionality of this phone and the clarity of the screen are resplendent in respect to my other phone which was a Galaxy S3 I dont yet know how to use every aspect of this phone but have found it to be much more user friendly and an overall wonderful device I love my Samsung Edge  you wont look at phones the same way again Tons of addon products too that work with the phone I dont like that you cant use voice to send messages like on my note i had The look and feel is second to none Love it
Samsung has always made great phones Because I frequently travel overseas I wanted an unlocked phone I also did not want all the bloatware that many carriers now load onto their phones 

Carefully read the Getting Started leaflet that comes with the phone If you have another Samsung phone it will make transferring the information from one phone to the other much easier using the small white dongle that comes in the package This was easy and fairly fast

A note of warning If you purchase an unlocked phone you may have trouble connecting your data plan It took the customer service people for my carrier about 30 minutes to figure out how to do this Because the phone was unlocked it needed special entries for the data plan not the standard ones my carrier uses

One other warning note that Ive run into When calling an automated switchboard make certain to add a 2 second pause to the number you are dialing otherwise your call may end up being dropped Samsung 7 has many convenient features and makes it cmfortable to use with one hand expensive but worth it  This phone is great The speed the look every feature By far my most favorite Samsung phone yet I love my new Samsung S7 Amazing design  operating system does all I need  more depenable cant think of anything else to say This Phone is amazing I had the galaxy 5 before i had galaxy 7 This phone is smaller than the previous models slick and very easy to use Love the camera features of the virtual camera the front camera and the photo edit options that are built in the features 
Good job Samsung once again Ive been a Samsung fan for years but the S7 Edge is a major upgrade Display is incredible Super crisp and colors are true Edge features alone are worth the price of phone I use apps edge tasks edge and people edge constantly People edge keeps me from having to wake phone constantly I can lay phone on table and determine if I need to respond to family or ignore calls based on color of edge display 
 I use Samsung Pay daily Vast majority of time it works first try Have had phone in pocket when jeans soaked by downpour and no issues 
In my case timing of upgrade was perfect I was able to give my son my old S5 after he spilled a glass of water on his nonSamsung phone and it died
 I am not typically one to get newest phone when it is released but this time I am glad I did Get one and you will not be sorry Before getting this phone I had the S6 and while it was a good phone it had a lot of problems I feel like with this new S7 it fixed all of the problems that the previous model had and I enjoyed the readdition of the expandable storage which I was disappointed the S6 didnt have Overall a great phone and also love the waterproof thing as my phone will be protected if it accidentally wants to take a swim in my toilet like my S6 did Best smartphone on the market All of the positive tech reviews back up the performance of this smartphone Much improved battery performance Lots of software improvements from my S3 that I loved Upgraded from an S3 which was a great smartphone The S7 is a high quality smartphone and the improved battery performance is a big plus The camera quality is excellent Purchased a week ago  easy transition from Galaxy S5   Very satisfied with phone in general  Nit picking runs hotter than previous phone battery life seems less than previous phone    Otherwise this phone is great This is my 3rd samsung phone  I love their phones  Just keep making them better  never will I go back to a iPhone  I still have not glee a chance top play with all the features but the camera is love the ease of use love it overt all great product The quick charge is advantageous in a rush The screen is so much brighter and clearer than my old S4 IVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR SEVEN DAYS I WENT FROM SERVICE EVERYWHERE TO NO SERVICE 75 OF THE TIME BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO HORRIBLE ON THE CHARGER MORNINGS  NITES THE PHONE IS GOING BACK Just got a this new phone Love the display much easier to read color is wonderful It is soooo much faster than my old phone Still trying out all the features
And very important to me with hearing aides fairly easy to hear on the phone The Samsung galaxy S7 is very useful for any setting no matter what got put it true is preforms like the 1st day it was purchased I brought the Galaxy S7 as my business phone after having issues with my iPhone and I have to say I absolutely LOVE IT I often find myself using this phone more than I do my personal phone The design and durability is amazing and the camera is to die for I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking to trade in or trade up As a 16 year old it was crucial for me to have a smartphone with a lot of storage easytouse phone and a nice looking phone The galaxy S7 edge really gave me that ultimate phone I wasnt a Samsung user and I switched to Samsung because I had to but after the first couple days I realized the features are twice as good as the other features from other phones and these phones cant do nearly as much as the Samsung but Samsung doesnt have the famous group messaging which is OK because there is still group messages but other than that the Samsung deserves 1010 and any other phone doesnt pass a 610 i was used to my note 5 the size isnt bad my only complaint is my 4g is horrible but thats because of my carrier besides that my only complaint is battery life Phone is great Excellent performance with okay features Awesome at multi tasking and jumping around from app to app Thank you for finally updating my phone I love it I just hope it has warranty on it Ive received my phone via FedEx with information of the shipments details which was very informative Thank you so muchIm glad Ivery been a loyal customer for many years  More than a phone more than email So many uses and features Products features is very easy to use Features are easy to use and understand Love all the features Waterproof great camera so glad I switched from apple Love my new Galaxy S7 Looks awesome and performence great Only issue I am having is with the key board I am sure Ill get used to it but for now its difficult and I make many mistakes with typing Could be that its just slimmer than my S5 Phone is great and I love it Only problem I have is that apps seem to quit sometime for some reason and Samsung pay I wish could be integrated into downloaded apps so I wouldnt have to enter details every time That feature is probably there but I dont see it coming up Had for a week galaxy  s7 and hate it  Battery dies so fast my phone wont last a whole work day Is so much smaller than my s5 Good note  is pictures are better  But I seriously need to find a way for the battery to last I just recently got my galaxy s7 and I absolutely love it 1010 would recommend Just be sure to get a case as the phones seem to be very delicate Im so glad I decided to go to the Samsung S7 I had the S5 and was ready for a change Ive already used the VR gear with it and Im so happy with it I love the sleek body of the phone how it fits in my back pocket but at the same time I dont feel like its too fragile The camera is amazing musher better than the 5 and with so many editing get features My favorite part about any of the galaxies is the ability to add memory with an SD card Definitely recommend this phone Really impressed by the overall performance of this phone
Improvements in much needed areas like the battery and some new nifty features to boot
Kudos to the development team and keep up the good work and the firmware updates coming Overall this is a good phone The battery life as well as the features are great The battery life is not to bad but like most phones apps are always running in the background Ill definitely get another one Best decision i made swapping my s5 for a s7love the upgraded phone and featurescamera is 100 times better and has plenty of features that make enjoying this phone easy I had a LG G2 before this and it was so much slower than my S7 Amazing phone with great design and excellent performance I like it better then the galaxy 5 but dont like having a separate battery I like having more memory So far its a great phonw S7 has replaced my laptop I debated between an I Phone and the Galaxy S7  I use my phone primarily for work email and calendar as well home email and calendar  Tons of easy to use features  Love the fingerprint security feature My Note II  died So decided to try this Love it Long battery life  easy to use lots of features I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 because I had the Galaxy S5 and was very happy with it I am impressed by the graphics and long battery life The sound is like surround sound Easy to use Great features Love it I bought this phone on the 4th under the pretenses that it was the best The salesman convinced me to buy this one instead of the HTC 10 I was looking at I like the phone The battery power isnt what he professed it to be  there are a lot of apps I wish I could get rid of a reason I was leaning toward the HTC that have been sending a lot of ads The photo quality is great  the phone is splash proof I havent fully submerged it Those were 2 characteristics I was definitely wanting in my new phone I loved my former phone the HTC M8  was sold on the HTC 10 before I even got there but after having the S7 I have to say they are very comparable I am a tad disappointed in the battery life  the screen has been unresponsive a few times while playing games But overall I do like the phone  it does handle everything Im using it for for the most part Love my S7 its screen is just amazing another home run for Samsung and finally they have at least moved the rear facing speaker to well the bottom not perfect but much better than the rear I switched from iPhone 6 to S7 and couldnt be happier More storage better camera and much easier to use Love the phone I adored my S5 and this is a delightful steam up in so many ways Its easy to learn the Galaxy S7 because it builds on the earlier models but the enhancements are so very satisfying I LOVE this phone No problems on the upgrade just a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the new features of the S7 I bought my phone about 10 days ago and so far it has been great for what I need The new features areally pretty straight forward and easy to maneuver My one thing is that the phone is super slippery and me being a clutz I already dropped it The screen which is advertised as shatter resistant is not and the screen protectors that you can put over it dont do a thing I really love this phone I got my S7 a week ago and i like it took some getting used to goin from a note 4 Not sure if my S7 has a glitch or what but when its blacked out I hit the home button and nothing after a min or so it decides to open with the camera Ive also noticed the battery life is good but not as good as my note 4 every thing seams okbattery doesnot last as I would like it to I have had this phone for approximately three months and had no problems better than my old note The S7 is a great phone Its very easy to use
Charges very quickly and the camera cant be beat It takes beautiful crisp clear photos in every light Also love the water proof feature I bought 2 of these and both my daughter and wife love them They love the size personalization options feel in their hand etc My favorite thing about this phone is the speed longer battery and most of all the expandable memory I had the s6 edge plus before and this is a major improvement This is hands down the best android experience to date Fast and capable of anything you can throw at it If the plastic build of the past has kept you away from the Galaxy S line now is the time to give this a try The Galaxy S7 Edge fits well in the hand and and is probably the most sleek phone around at this time in my opinion The glass on the back though beautiful is slippery but the curves give it a great feel in the hand The notification light that I miss from certain manufacturers is included with this device Camera is excellent in low light and focus immediately dont let the drop in megapixels from the last generation fool you Photos come out better than previous builds due to the larger camera sensor allowing more light to pass through in return higher quality photos Battery life with my normal use is about a day usually ending in the evening around 3040 in my case In my opinion you cant go wrong with this device I dropped the phone taking it out of the shipping box and cracked the screen  So much for tough water resistant qualities Very easy to use I would recommend to my friends I use my smart phone mostly for music then phone calls and internet I purchased a 200gb micro memory card and loaded it full of music I could arrange the music the way I wanted it arranged and it was so easy to load Now I take my music everywhere I go Its also nice to have a few bluetooth speakers to occasionally crank it up Thanks you very much S7 Awesome phone thanks Samsung I just upgraded from a much older phone and I am very impressed  Great pictures memory battery and overall features I only use Samsung phones since I got the galaxy s5 now I got the s7 an its exactly what I expected a wonderful phone Very nice Easy transition Great features Its a great phone it runs amazing and has some really cool features on it just a little more than I wanted to pay for it but its been a great phone so far Awesome phone big performance boost over my S5 I just got the phone one week ago I am still learning the many functions of the phone I got the basic down and the phone Is user friendly I like the fact that the battery last longer than my previous phone I am not giving it a five star rating because I only had the phone for very short time I love this phone sooooo much It does however need more protection accessory wise I would love to hear of a provider that offers perfect tempered glass and cases that dont effect the edge features Please respond asap as I am an advocate and would love to offer the very best for our customers who want the best phone Samsung s7 edge I am adjusting to my first smart phone Many features that I like ie conversation texting email apps The three features that I dont like 1 the touch screen keyboard  I prefer my old Samsung Zeal flip phones real keyboard 2 this phone is more fragile and 3 the battery life compared to my old phone Everything is good in s7 edge Only problem is hard to handle with shorter hands Phone is easy to use Also sounds are good and loud The only negative things is the service is awful My s5 was so much better Bought the phone a week ago  Happy with it so far I love the features of the phone the most and storage SPACE I already recommended the phone to family members and friends I love the phonebut it is also my first cell phone ever So I dont know what I have been missing
Seems to do everything I can think of asking of it though Easy to navigate and learn how to use  I really like how easy it is to read the screens and the sound when talking to people is great Im still learning how to use it as it is my first smartphone but I like it a lot Bought this 2 weeks ago so glad i did Samsung Galaxy 7 is the best phone on the market The camera is awesome Verizon store switch policy was easy as pie Only had for  few weeks so still finding new options Very pleased so far Great design amazing display and super fast what more could I ask for I bought this phone for my son and it has so many great qualities we was looking for Who would make a phone out of tempered glass I dropped my phone and now the back of it is shattered I would never recommend this phone to anyone but if someone wants one I would tell them to buy an otter box right away because it will break if you drop it Everyone has dropped their phones from time to time and I cant believe that they would make a phone this way Stiil learning but great to play with Similar to the Samsung S5 You can not move the apps ikon away from the edge Other than that its a good phone I bought this a few weeks ago and while it is a nice looking phone the battery gets really hot and drains very quickly  in half the time that my old S5 did This phone is awesome I would recommend buying protection because unlike the old version the screen glass is more delicate The phone is durable though the phone was in my jacket pocket and I accidently slammed the car door when my jacket got stuck It bent by the volume button and cracked screen on top but the screen still works  I expected the black screen to slowing come but it hasnt Phone is nice but battery life is not great on it I am extremely satisfied with the Galaxy S7 I bought to replace my S5 The S7 is a great upgrade from the old S4 With the expandable memory you can carry all your pictures and music Bought a week agolove it I got my phone about 2 weeks ago the only issue I have is that the battery doesnt last very long need to recharge every night by 500 pm phone is at 15 Im at work all day so I dont use my phone very often Not happy with battery life Fantastic phone Very cutting edge I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to this S7 and glad I did  I am really enjoying it  And it takes awesome pictures I was afraid I was downgrading in a way since its slightly smaller than the note 3 I had I was wrong I love the S7 edge Love everything about the phone except the battery is dead in about 8 hours And its not like Im doing a lot videos and Facebook I have great service with a tower a half a mile away from work so its not like its straining for service Would definitely recommend cordless charger Love the phone It has great features and it is easy to use I love my new phone  I purchased it with the plan of using the VR for my granddaughter  It has been great I had not planned on getting a new phone but when I stopped in to pick up a charger for my tablet I changed my mind  I loved the S7 and the features It is very light  weight The transfer of all my apps and information was seamless  The battery life is incredible Love love love it So sleek So very yes So very must have Had battery issues with my motorola This is my first samsung and it is so easy to use Would definitely recommend this phone Great phone and enjoy using the new device I had put off getting a new phone because I didnt relish the idea of learning how to use it  However I am happy to say that this phone was easy for me to learn new processes I bought this phone because my LG g3 had a sim card reader issue they couldnt fix I thought the phone would be a little more durable as it fell off my leg onto the floor and cracked the back glass on the phone such a poor design also you have to press much harder than any other phone Ive had in the past to type the fingerprint reader works great  awesome camera charges fast otherwise all is the same old 
Cons the glass rear cover is delicate  battery doesnt last as long as you would think alarm clock is worthless maybe after a few more months I will feel differently Hope it lasts that long Excellent product I switched from a Verizon Droid This phone is so much more user friendly and with all the accessories Im very happy Im really enjoying this phone Its a great phone to have when u have a big family like I do I love taking pics and videos more with this phone the only problem Im still having is taking pics when my children are moving fast it still blurs whats moving Other than that Im really enjoying this phone I love how much extra memory this phone has compared to my old phone I love my S7 3 of my family members have the same phone We all love it Its not bad I bought the S7 for a 55 TV promotion Verizon had going on I dont hate the phone but were it not for the promise of a TV Id have stuck to LG Have had a few samsungs as well as a few other brands Always like the Sumsungs The short time Ive had this phone very pleased with all the functions the phone can do learning something new every day highly recommend would get another samsung no questions asked I love everything about this phone Amazing camera My only complaint is it was hard finding a nice screen protector for it I tend to keep my phones for as long as they work well  my old Galaxy 3 still works but needed a battery so I  upgraded mainly because this one 7s is supposedly waterproof but if not it will be when my case arrives WOW what a world of difference there is  Battery Life isnt bad but I dont think its as good as advertised unless you turn everything off to conserve it  The screen is so much better than my old galaxy and the camera takes great pictures  tons of memory and expandable to whatever you want   Hope it lasts as long as the last one did  BTW Verizon is the best cell service provider hands down  not the cheapest but the best coverage of them all 
 Thank You I would definitely rate this phone a 9 It has everything that you could ever need in one device The only downfall in my opinion is the messaging app as far as themes and customization I would give it a 10 but as far as settings definitely a 5 Like every about this phone The camera is outstanding It is very easy to get started and when I get confused the support help is outstanding most hours of the day I really like the edge and how big your view able the screen it The finger print security is a dream and works very well The fact that you can expand the storage memory is fantastic I think I will have a hard time filling the 128GB card up 
I would highly recommend this phone to anyone that needs what this phone can provide Very easy transition from my previous phone It seems as though the battery life is not all that great Sometimes i need to charge it twice a day I rarely use it when i am at work I just purchased my new Galaxy S7 yesterday and I love it Its fast and easy to use Ill recommend this to others for sure It has a sleek new look to it as well Thank you Samsung for you great design I bought this phone a week ago  Had some difficulties transferring the information from my old phone but the in store Verizon staff made it happen and were happy to help Recently had broken my old phone and was in the upgrade period so b I decided to go with the s7 and the phone has been gteat The durability of this phone is phenomenal It has been put too the test a time or two Also it being waterproof helps I must say that my favorite feature is the camera The quality of the photos are superb I highly recommend this phone only had the phone a week but it is assume So far so good no  problems great  phone and east to use Like it better then the S4 I had id give it all 5 stars but battery life is still terible The phone has been more difficult to set up than the motorola phones I have previously owned my personal email is still not working yet I cannot believe the clarity of photos on this device It is lIke Im using an dslr when I use pro mode The fast battery charging is also great especially when charging wireless on the dock Upgraded from the S5 and love it Have had the phone for two weeks and it was an easy transition from my S4 I got main about 1 week ago its great Speed of operation design battery life expandable memory waterproof Life is good with my S7
Previous galaxy versions owner and Samsung phone owner for over 15 years Love my Gear VR that came along with the purchase Glad I went with the regular S7 Olny complaint is they did put a little tiny bevel in the edge of the glass even on the plain S7 model To avoid Edge envy This is an issue when you apply protective glass cover  your finger catches on t he lip of the glass cover when you swipe but I am getting used to it Have had it a week love it I dont like the glass screen cover that does not cover the whole screen but has gaps on the sides Ive been a Samsung userowner for years now The phone continues to get better with each device My previous phone was the Galaxy 6 This is a significant upgrade from that device Screen quality battery life and internal storage are three of my top favorite features Im starting to get used to the phone however I think it would be great to have the basic features in a little booklet that comes with the phone  We all learn differently The S7 has great response time and still getting used to all the features maybe a little larger screen would have been better So far so good After using Windows phones for years I switched to this Android  Still getting used to it but general pleased Only wish the battery life was better But the fast charge makes up for this Not meeting my expectation as a Samsung product should Signal strength very poor Processing speed should be better Speakers could be better Battery life needs to be more Needs the power saver just like active Over all the active series os should be used in the S7 also Cant wait to get out of my contact with this phone Samsung can do better they know it Ive used iPhone since they came out and recently switched to Samsung It was a little rough at first but Im gradually getting used to it There phone is very nice but a bit more complicated as far as advanced features go I love the Edge design and how the I can access information just with a click The screen is optimal for reading or watching movies The camera take excellent clear detailed pictures 2 weeks so far and all 4 phone have troubles staying connected to Wifi Our old phones never had this problem  Battery life is weak at best I upgraded from an S3  The features on the S7 are great but the signal strength is terrible  I had no problems with the S3 signal strength have tried other phones always come back to galaxy this phone has great features takes good picture has a fantastic screen love this phone I realy like my galaxy s7 phone the one thing that i wish was better is battery life I can only compare it to my Nexus 4 Size is comparable Galaxy S7 seems faster Excellent picture quality Ive only had it a short time so thats all I got for now Honestly I used to be with Verizon for years when I was on the family plan But now that I have a single plan I am pretty disappointed  First off purchasing the galaxy s7  I expected it to have much more new features but comparing it to an old galaxy note2 I actually miss it I guess what I am feeling is I favor Verizon the galaxy s7 is a good phone I believe tough it is a bit over priced and all the extra charges Verizon is doing now is killing the excitement of purchasing a new phone I just got this phone for my birthday and Im already loving it Its sooo beautiful also I absolutely love my new galaxy s7 phone I have owned iphones as well as other Samsung phones but the galaxy s7 is my favorite Extremely please with this phone this probably the best phone that i have ever used and im very happy with the performance the camera and also with its flexibility i will surely be recommending this product to others There are loads of simple features that even a novice like me make it look easy After 2 years and some mishaps to my Galaxy S5 a few drops in the field training army field training  the lifeproof case holds up to its claims I love the speed and functionality of the S7 to add purchased a lifeproof case to step up the waterproof rate but miss the IR feature of the S5  used peel app for my audiovideo equipment Otherwise the S7 is sleek and photo phenomenal Upgraded from the S5 Best decision I made Better data plan and more features that I use for my needs good device     i like it It is an amzing device I love it Recommend it to anyone Wouldnt trade it for anything I got better phone call receptionperformance in my home with my Galaxy S5 What did you do Samsung Downgrade the antenna Very user friendly  waterproof Happy to upgrade from flip phone My first smartphone highly recommend it The display is great Bought this a week ago and love it sweet camera too The phone is great I love the camera it is easy to use and takes great pictures Not so great product from Samsung Before Edge 7 I was using Note 3 So in comparison with Note 3 this is not that great even right out of the box Though it is curved down because of its edge feature it still is thicker than almost a 3 year old Note 3 In the beginning Edge 7s battery was running for a fairly long period of time but now after 4 months of use the battery drains like crazy even on a power saving mode 

It is so slippery that it easily slips out of the pocket Yes I use my phone without any protective cover not even the screen protector for this one And why should I When one of the most hyped feature of this phone is scratch and water resistant Luckily it had a soft landing so far such as a carpet or the car seat so no scratches yet Except for one major incident where this phone fell on my closed touch screen laptop breaking the touch screen of my laptop 

The photos are also not that great Since its camera happens to be another most hyped feature The photos are grainy 

Edge 7 being the latest from Samsung still does not have that rich look that of its Note Though it has managed to get a sophisticated look by its curved edges but that has become more like a mar for sometimes you wont be able to hold it in your palm without activating other apps Especially while texting or watching videos

Overall not that happy with the product Very happy with this phone  Lots of great features OK this is an expensive phone no doubt But the improvements Samsung has made are incredible But I stromglysuggest the 64GB package You will want to download tons of apps take tons of pics and vids Very disappointed in the durability of this phone My previous phone had a gorilla glass screen and Kevlar backing so it was very durable I expected the same from the Samsung Galaxy S7 The case on this phone is very slippery so I could see the need for a case to protect it Unfortunately I wasnt quick enough with that purchase After less than a week the phone slipped out of my hand while removing it from my pocket Of course the screen cracked on impact I would expect a phone to be durable enough to withstand a fall from less than 30 inches I guess looks are more important This is my first smart phone so I wanted one that was both easy to use and had all the latest technology  The Samsung Galaxy S7 met all my expectations and I am enjoying learning about its features and discovering useful apps Very happy with my Samsung Galaxy S7 seems to be several years ahead of the iPhone I had my old phone far too long so I went shopping for a new one and discovered my new great Samsung I bought this phone a week 2 weeks ago and I couldnt be happier I thought I would need more than a 3 day weekend to transition from a Galaxy S4 to the new S7 but it was easy The speed of the phone is amazing and I dont have anything bad to say I first got a iPhone s6 and wasnt happy with the features on it I exchanged it for the Samsung Galaxy s7 and love my new phone Great phone with great features Fast Terrific camera Ive only had my new phone for a very short time but so far Im loving it Ive had my Samsung Galaxy s7 for a week now and so far I love it  Everything is easy to access  the pictures I take are very clear  and the parole at the Verizon store are always there to help should I need them I got this phone about week ago Phone has some advance technical features such as fingerprint unlocking however it is missing some features such as lock screen banner Put off updating my phonewish I had done it years ago I went from an S3 to an S7 so Ive got to get acquainted with all the new features but Im having a fun doing it Ive had the S7 since release date and its a great phone with loaded features including 4k photovideo Love that Samsung brought back the external storage option and water resistant capabilities The only downside is have found is when service is low or out the battery drains very rapidly less than 8 hours if there was a low network battery option fix then I would give 6 stars Overall a great device and very happy Love the water resistant features Camera is amazing also Got it a week ago and love it The switch from the S5 to the S7 was like I had the same phone I was used to but new and better no learning time required The S7 is pewrry decent but im dissapointed at how fast tje nattery discharges Alrhougjt the fast charge feature counters that I dont wamt to be stuck to an pitlet all day Great phone camera is awesome Love this phone its runs so much faster then my S4 and the battery actually lasts all day Easy to use and figure out Only thing that I dont like is that I dont have my universal remote on the phone anymore none of my remotes at home work so thats why I had the universal remote I love this phone but I already had to send my phone in because of an over heating issue Got this phone for my wife a couple weeks ago I had already switched from iPhone and now convinced her too as well She seems to really like it She was worried it would be to big of a change from iPhone but has picked it up well Everyone is amazed how great the display is Camera shots are quickly focused and brilliant The edge feature provides your favorite apps with a simple swipe Great tool overall My S5 had a much better battery life even 2 years in Besides that phone is compact and very easy to navigate and use Bought my S7 Edge in March and only had a few minor issues The phone performed great
Yesterday my phone froze After trying to reset it I saw a nice green line on the display see attached
Weird thing is that my phone still works the screen doesnt
When it booted up at first it gave me just enough screen time to be able to login after which the screen turned black
I that mode I can take a screenshot that gets uploaded to the cloud where I could see the phone was working just fine
Now here lies the engineering design fault
With this phone MHL doesnt work so you cant just hook it up to the TV and at least have some remote control to be able to backup anything
SideSync nope TeamViewer nope either
SmartSwitch for PC wont back anything up as my phone is not set to File Transfer Mode

I could see how the screen could have been busted to cause an issue like this but my phone is in perfect condition never droped and alwayhs in my OtterBox case without a single scratch
Just search for green or black screen on google to see that its occurring more than you think

As of this morning I get no screen at all even when power cycling it  I switched from a LG G3 to my current Samsung S7 

I find that the S7 is easier to use and has longer battery life Also the screen does not get overly hot when viewing a video unlike the LG G3 The S7 recharges extremely fast

Sound quality is very good for its small speaker size I love this phone Im a longtime galaxy and iPhone user but this year I was blown with Samsung s7 especially the 7edge I love the galaxy s line phone this year was an incredible upgrade from the S6 that didnt really caught my eye but this phone I had to have since the rumors were leaking about about its features This phone honestly is better then Iphone and I will remain a Samsung customer for the foreseeable future Love it so farbattery life could be better but love everything else about it Overall Verizon experience  satisfactory I selected this model because of its resistance to watermoisture and the camera clarity  It appears the screens sensitivity increases when dampwet because when my shirt becomes wet sweat it causes apps and functions to activate The camera photo  video is excellent So sleek so clear live it Absolutely love all of my Samsung Galaxys I have had a Samsung Galaxy phone since the Samsung Galaxy 3 came out And unlike other popular devices that come out consistently with a new model every seven to nine months there is always an undeniable difference in the newer model when Samsung comes out with the next galaxy Multitasking Check The speed I need Check And the reliability that a business professional depends on Check Got nothing but love for Samsung Keep up the good work guys This phone has great features It takes awesome pictures and video High definition Screen and camera and the best mobile I ever used till now Design is good but sometime the activities are very slow Good phone just wish it was smaller Like the durability Samsung has the best android phones out Wouldnt trade it for any other phone company I have only had this phone for a week I went with the Samsung S7 for its water resistance  I dropped my iPhone in water TWICE The first time it was only 3 mos old But this time they couldnt revive it I was having trouble with it freezing up anyway so was not a happy iPhone owner 
  I didnt realize what I was getting instead I love the features the pics and ease of use I thought my fuzzy pics were just me but now I am able to take awesome pics Who knew I would recommend this phone to anyone ESPECIALLY  IPhone users You wont be sorry I bought this phone as an upgrade for a flip open phone prepaid acct Picture quality and resolution much better than our older phone  I also like the wifi access and find that very useful  This phone is worlds apart from nonsmart phones  The countless available apps are amazing  and it has video capability  Texting is much better wasted a lot of money for nothing I couldnt be more satisfied with my new Samsung S7 Edge 
Works and looks great Upgrade was due stayed with the Samsung Not hardly the phone I expected it to be This is the pone Ive been waiting years to be made it has everything you need I havent had this phone very longbut I love it no problems with it like Ive had with other phones My previous phone was very durable Gorilla Glass screen and Kevlar backing I had it almost five years without any damage I have had the Galaxy S7 for one week The case is very slippery so I was in the market for a protective covering or something to improve the grip I wasnt quick enough It slipped out of my hand while removing it from my pocket this morning and of course the screen cracked Very disappointed in the durability of this product It should be designed to handle a fall from 30 inches I have had my new S7 Edge for 2 weeks and I am loving it I know I have more to learn but am having great fun doing so Such great photos and my boss says it is the clearest he has ever heard someone on a cell phone Glad i upgraded  Was  a very easy transition The phone is great but I cannot use it in my hhomeMy phone has been set for WiFi calling because   VZ dosent have sufficient tower coverage in sellbrook Many phones do not accept wifi calls Please help with this problem I have had a few iPhone before switching to the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and that was the best switch I have ever made I will now support Samsung and all ways will Very fast processing  Wireless charging is awesome This is the 5th android I have owned My previous phone was the Galaxy S5 I regarded that as the first Android phone that was actually reliable The S7 is a mature well designed phone It has some quirks but overall it is a very productive and fast phone The camera is best ive ever seen in a phone The battery life can very widely based on your settings but it lasts all day even with the Screen Always On feature that shows a clock even when the screen is off Overall I would recommend this flagship phone to anyone looking for a quality device Great phone with lots of features Definitely worth the money I have had this phone for about a month  The camera is great  My only issue that it is really slow at txting photos and I seem to have to send the photo and then my txt that goes along with it and if I put more than one photo on one txt it may never be sent By far the best phone I have had like that they brought back memory card port Id recommend the S7 to everyone Changed carriers and smartphone and have been happy with both I love my new Galaxy S7 For the people saying phones are getting too big Samsung added a one hand feature that makes the screen easier to navigate with one hand The display is great and for a lighter weight phone it is pretty durable my girlfriend knocked it off a hightop at a restaurant and the screen was uncracked The battery life is much improved as well
Overall very happy with the upgrade I love phone that its waterproof and great reviews in the specs Excellent camera The Galaxy S7 is a very impressive phone Although no larger than my S4 the S7 has a number of significant improvements One is the OLED screen that is always on Another is the battery life which seems to be quite a bit better than the S4 

One interesting change is the screens cover glass The screen edges are rounded which gives it a sleek look but that small edge radius also makes it difficult to add a tempered glass screen protector Thats because the screen protector glass cant overlap the rounded edge consequently screen protectors for the S7 must be smaller than the actual screen size This appears to be a general complaint with the screen protectors but the reality is that the screen design drives the smaller screen protector

I havent yet tried the wireless charging but thats a feature that Im excited about Also the biometric finger print reader seems like a nice feature but its not yet clear how well that functions

Overall Im very impressed with the phone so far so good takes some getting used to seem like a few  more key strokes I got this phone a week ago its great miss the universal remote but at least I have extra storage cant wait to get some of the accessories that go with it I just bought this a week ago and love it The camera is much better than the 6  Took forever to focus I have had the phone for two weeks now I can not use the power saving mode as it will not allow the voice mail app to work it affects Bluetooth connections and creates issues with Facebook and Facebook messenger apps My only other compliant is that it will not allow me to set ringtones or notification other than the default on many of hte apps or contacts
Other than that the phone is pretty good sound quality is better than my S5 and the 32 gig is great the phone is not running out of space like the S5 did almost immediately Bought Samsung Galaxy S7 as an upgrade to an LG love it works great Its easy to use water proof lots of memory the edge will show notifications in different colors for missed calls messages events etc Also you can make your current screen smaller to look at a new screen Really love this phone I purchased online due for an upgrade my S6 started acting a little funky so I decided why not I actually was interested in the S7 Edge and yet not much difference except battery so I saved some money and just went with the S7 such a great phone so quick smooth working I love it so far happy with the purchase been a long time iPhone user had the first or second model ive never quite liked the Android phones due to all of the added Value software thats loaded on them Although the GS7 is loaded the same way its at least put into folders so you can find what you need The only issues i have with the GS7 is the inability to move the Apps folder from the bottom bar Just upgraded from my old Galaxy S3 which is obviously a big step and Im really happy with the S7 Some of the settings were hard to find at first and arent very intuitive but theres some good articles online that unpack all of the different settings you can adjust and how to find them Camera is great even with the zoom when the zoom was basically unusable on the S3 because it got so blurry Processing speeds are great havent had any glitches delays or freezes at all Battery life is splendid so far Ive been going a day and a half without charging it and dont need to turn on power saving mode or turn off datawifi to conserve battery The speed charging function is also really cool charging overnight is just overkill it takes less than 2 hours for a full charge In the end it was more expensive than I wouldve liked but is a great product and hopefully it continues to be worth the price A crown jewel on the outside A true marvel on the inside
A real wonder
Outstanding Still learning about the features and the differences from old phone but easy to figure out Love this phone Was worried about it being larger than I wanted but it is awesome This device has lived up to the hype The battery is much better than its predecessor Also it has an expandable memory slot This works great if you are taking lots of photos and videos everything I was looking for in a new S7 This replaced by Galaxy S5 Though the 5 was a good phone the S7 just outperforms it in both speed and setup For a senior citizen it is ideal I hate having to get a new phone  but this one was pretty easy to transition to  The only thing that I dont really like is that I have to press harder on my screen for swipe My only complaint is the size I am used to a smaller phone which I can hold and text onehanded ThEd S7 Edge is a really great phone The best feature is the wireless charging I hate pulling on the wire when a phone is plugged in Im a big man and I tendont to be a little rough with these type of items The edge notification I like also Instead of them popping up on the screen right on the edge thumbs up The processor is supper fast I love that The SD card placement is priceless Taking the back of the phone really suck After so many times of taking that off it dont close the same Being water resistant up to five feet is the best feature as of yet Especially withelpful those that have kids like I do My Note 4 was put in the toilet Just maybe some type of case to protect the speaker slot on a case to protect it would be great I was told that the speaker loses its sound when it gets wet Ive been a Galaxy fan since day 1 Only issue is the battery life Phone works perfectly good SD card slot is a plus The Galaxy S7 strikes an ideal balance of features and performance Who its for Android fans who want the best phone to date Top strengths Awesome camera lightningfast performance and great battery life  plus expandable storage and waterresi Takes nice pictures check it out All aspects of this phone are nice Great look design and battery life is way better The only thing I wish they had for this product is a full case so it is protected better I love my phone Its fast very easy to use and one of the best phones ive ever had I love using samsung products Battery life is better than any smart phone that ive ever owned A great phone to use Beautiful fast brilliant display battery last all day with average use about a half hour to one hour of games Fast charger is really fast I only wish I had gotten the gold the one on display where purchased was not a real phone and it was dirty so it looked ugly so I got the black I later regretted it when I saw a clean real one I almost forgot the low light camera is awesome day or night I really like the battery life its amazing and the 4k graphics are amazing  sound quality is amazing I bought this phone so I can keep better track of my schedule It takes great photos and it is easy to set up your calendar I have had this phone for about 2 months now and I love it so far Hoping it holds up Is the best phone I have ever own Its better than the iPhone The edge has wonderful features I love it I recently changed to the Samsung Galaxy 7 edge because I was getting so sick of Apple disappointing me and not only am I happy with all the far better performance I get from Samsung It being waterproof gave me a lifeline to reach out you see I am a WV flood victim and through a flash flood and 9 inches of hammering rain my phone let me reach out to let people no I was in danger but alive  Overall happy with the phone But the durability for screen could be better Just have to adjust to the difference from old phone Samsung 5 I love Samsung I have had S4 and S6 previously   My S4 was probably my favorite phone ever design and functionality
I have had the S7 for 2 weeks and I really want to love it but I dont  It is sensitive and has little fits It goes to black screen the volume is horrible charge does not hold long and it super delicate 
I have never scratched much less cracked a screen with my other phones  I dropped this one in her case on a wood floor and the bottom spiderwebbed I had it 4 days  I dropped the others without cases on pavement with no problems not even a scratch 
So besides the fact my phone seems to be a 15 year old teenage girl it also is as delicate Purchased the s7 edge a few months ago and absolutely love all the features and how sleek the phone is Has a great battery life that lasts all day display looks great even when outside in the sun With the fast charger its ready to go in an hour 

Downsides are the phone gets very hot when used for videos or games themes are not customisable occasionally lags when switching apps I went from an iPhone 6 plus to the s7 edge from Samsung this phone is so easy to use the transition was unbelievable After use the fetutures on this phone it makes my iPhone look like a toy I strongly recommend the s7 edge plus its water proof up to 5 feet of water Jamming lightning fast phone But the Bluetooth on the phone never would connect with my car Verizon tried their best to help but even the experts were stumped So I got an IPhone not as good bummer for me But at least it works with my car The quick charge feature which is new is great that with a battery that lasts longer make this phone the best phone I have had to date 
I use my phone to the surprise of many as a phone When I started researching to get a new phone told the sales person I didnt want a camera or mini computer I wanted a phone I make a lot of phone calls and this phone is clear people Im speaking to can hear me and the signal is strong 
The only thing I like better from my pervious phone is in had a signature on all my text messages which I also do a lot of texting with phone you cannot have a permanent signature you have you go to quick message which is not as easy as before 
All in all I like this phone and I meets my requirements for a phone I had a s5 before and really like the new s7 alot The camera is much better and the battery lasts longer I really like the camera integrated with making a phone call too The size is good too  liked that is seems a bit thinner but not a tiny phone I have to admit I have been showing it off at work a bunch  This was a great choice for me nice design many colors Fast waterproof  what more can i say My Samsung Galaxy S7 has a great camera It takes wonderful videos The only problem is that the battery life only lasts me three quarters of a day I barely even use it and it dies so fast I got this device 2 days before it was released because I preordered it I also got a free gear s2 from preordering The phone I will say only really needs a better battery 68GBs of ram and Micro USBC to stay ahead of the competitors I recommend this phone on the daily and I think it is a beautiful phone Samsung gets better and better every year I do really love the fact that you can upgrade every year with this phone as well not saying that I will get tired of the phone or that I am not satisfied with it but I do know that all manufacturers are making all phones more expensive to buy and it is just nice to know you have all the options I was very skeptical about switching from iPhone or Samsung The biggest reason for my switch was because I was bored with my phone The s7 edge has definitely taken care of that issue The only thing I dont like is that Im having a hard time connecting to WiFi and that it overheats Screen cracked at the beach from heat and its not covered under warrantee Other than that Im glad I switched Very happy with the upgraded features over the Galaxy 5 I love my new S7 Its so easy to use and makes my life easier The battery life is great and the fast charging is amazing Its a  new phone  So far so good Love this phone works great Had the s5 was also great but this one has some easier features and I like the bigger screen I really like the notification setting so I can set the time of it Love my new S7 Fast excellent camera very sharp screen Everything I need in a smartphone Best phone Ive ever had so far compared to any other phone Ive had in five years Samsung really stepped up their game with the S7 I upgraded from the S5 so of course Im blown away They got rid of the removable back which I think is a huge step in the right direction The phone feel much sturdier It is waterproofed from the inside this time around so its more water secure than previous installments 

I love everything about this phone from the small convenience tools to the Samsung Pay This phone has become a tool for everyday activities for me I enjoyed using Samsung products because is the best products that I have ever used and I have all Samsung equipments in my house Take on spills and splashes with a premium waterresistant design

Truly the latest and greatest Samsung yet I love this phone All of the features on this phone are exciting The camera modes now are crazy cool My last galaxy was the S4 so maybe there were exciting features that I missed between the 5  6 Doesnt matter to me though I still love this thing Own for one week Love it Works well switched from iphone a bit of a learning curve good features great pics miss siri Awesome phone I love it I have the Samsung galaxy S7 Edge and its a great phone for every day use but dont stray too far away from the charger In my experience I would have to charge the phone at least twice a day for my usage I had one exchange email account and four other nonexchange email accounts Its very nice to hold in the hand and it takes great pictures and video This is the best phone out there I love the wireless charging feature The Edge bar is very ergonomic I luv my new phone Drawback is it kept restarting by itself I set back to factory reset Hoping that fixes it I have had this for only a week but my old version was the Samsung s4 which is very similar so it was really easy to get going on it I like the longer battery time and it interfaces better and  quicker with the apps I use Havent tried all of the new features yet  but will be working on it Seems more intuitive than my older version was  Would recommend I hate change This phone was easy to learn It is quick and the accessories are fun I like everything about this phone Especially the camera features This phone takes great pictures  there are all kinds of different options I love the screen on this phone its crisp and clear The battery life is excellent Its speedy and the camera is great The always on display is nice The battery life is improved than the s5 I hope they make the gear vr more universal not only certain apps you can open when using the vr This phone has lived up to my expectations 100 I love it I absolutely love this phone it has a large screen but still fits in my pocket it works very well I couldnt be happier LOVE THIS PHONE Great color  text clarity easy to use superior pictures Extremely  happy with S7 First phone Good sized screen Easy to use Just ok I thought battery would be better Nothing special about design feels too same as Samsung 6 Phone is good but besides being waterproof i cant tell that much difference from my samsung galaxy 6 This is my 3rd Samsung phone Love it Great is a phone and performance   Since upgrading from my Samsung Galaxy S3 to the new S7 every aspect of the phone is an improvement Not that I didnt like the S3  I did but it was getting outdated and had trouble with reception out of area and went through batteries like a candy addict goes through Skittles I am so glad that I upgraded The ease of transition was simple though Im still learning new things about the phone Battery lasts me a day and Im able to use the phone anywhere without signal issues YAY This is the first Samsung phone I have owned It is much more versatile than my previous smartphone The deals I received at time of purchase made the price reasonable The operation of the phone is intuitive and I look forward to learning more about its capabilities a big improvement on my S5 Great phone Exceptional camera Good feel Mediocre battery life if used frequently I bought this phone 3 weeks ago and its absolutely amazing Its fast plenty of memory and the vr features are astonishing I love my s7 most useful and best working phone I have ever had And water resistant on top of everything The S7 is worthy upgrade A faster processor and better camera definitely make it worthwhile I have had my Samsung S7 phone for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it  I have realized that I truly prefer the Samsung phones over the other brands Water is a part of our everyday day life that means any accident could happen at any time With the waterproof feature you can feel safe around water any time of the day It is an absolutely lovely feature I have had a Galaxy S5 for the past two years and my wife another make and model  Her having another make and model was a huge mistake  Her phone had to be replaced once and both gave her fits the whole two years  Upgrading us both to the S7 which we have had now for just over a week was a very smart thing to do  Both phones are working great  The only complaint I have is that they as well as seemingly any smart phone come with apps that are just not needed and take up space The battery wont even last a day with moderate usage My only issues with this phone is that it gives me error messages when plugged into the pc for file transfers There was also a small issue when I first started the droid with messages not coming in but once that was taken care of we are pretty good good but need instruction I would recommend this product to others most definitely I love how it is waterproof I had mine in my back pocket using the restroom I stood up and it fell out my back pocket yup right into the toilet But for it being waterproof It was ok and have not had any issues Very easy to navigate the new phone It works even better than I thought it would The volume is loud enough so you can hear music when you play it and the battery lasts all day You can completely charge the phone in less than 2 hours with the fast charger I have tried every single smart phone there is and Samsung is superior just got my galaxy 7s the phone is great This could be a great device Almost identical to GS6 with more memory speed better battery And also the return of SD Ram slot and water resistance  I have one big problem the screen  The screen display should be it best feature but for some reason Samsung chose to give it a slight barely noticeable curve on the edges I am not talking about the S7 Edge version of the phone  This slight curve makes it impossible to get almost any tempered glass screen display to fit properly on this unit  You have to choose between tempered glass which does not cover the width of the screen or you can go with some models that try to fit the full width but wont stick on the curved edges and will allow dust underneath  This may seem like a minor complaint but this phone is too expensive to go without a screen protector and all the ones available for the phone dont fit  GS6 does not have this issue because the screen is perfectly flat a tempered glass fits perfectly  It is annoying to the point where I may consider returning it because I have a screen protector that doesnt cover the entire screen and it looks terrible  Search for every screen protector for this phone and read the reviews for the screen protector  They are mostly bad reviews because they dont cpover the screen or they do cover it but wont stick on the edges  Turns out that it is not the fault of the screen protector it is the fault of the screen designed by Samsung Has the latest technologyfasteasy to use Great battery I have my watch sync with it Im very happy with the phone and the way I was treated Having trouble setting up Facebook wont recognize my information there constantly getting virus cleanup messages and messages wanting me to subscribe to things  Cant just open my phone and make a phone call without cancelling seven different windows This phone broke the second day we owned it  do not believe them when they say it has toughened glass The case shattered the screen broke and the glass screen protector broke when the back of the case shattered Buyer beware  if youre going to get it get a case immediately and dont leave any glass showing Thumbs up plenty good I have only been using the new phone about a week  It was easy to catch on to the new format on some items Firstbattery battery battery Much improved battery life even though I prefer removable batteries The camera is a big improvementand faster Having a micro SD on a smartphone is a mustthanks for adding back This phone is improved without feeling like a whole new device or layout Would recommend upgrade or switch to this phone when able I had bought this phone a few weeks ago Good phone a lot brighter The screen is easy to read The one hand feature is awesome I us it often This really is an amazing phone great features battery life is great fast charging Only thing I doneed like is the screen is a little curved on the sides so its hard to find a screen protector that covers the whole front Its my wifes first smart phone She only had a texting phone before She loves it Yeah maybe the S7 is a lot of phone for the first one but it was the same price as the S6 and S5 so why not Weve had no problems with it and shes learning she can do just about everything she can do on her Chromebook My husband and I recently have upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S7 phones These phones are so easy to use beautiful to look at and come equipped with super cameras too This phone makes you feel like a million bucks just holding it They are the perfect size too Not super bulky and very sleek Ive had the phone a little over a week and so far so good Still learning how to use all of the features but I like the phone I tried several phones prior to settling on the Galaxy S7 What a great phone overall It feels right perfect weight great features etc Samsung did a great job on this one Battery life very shortantenna coverage area not nearly as good as Droid turbo So far I am very happy with my S7 I really like my new Galaxy S7 phone Its fast and the battery life is better than the S6 Edge I had before Im enjoying my new phone  wish it had FaceTime though Gr8 Device with good memory storage space more lovely features I just bought the phone and it is different from my old one My daughter is going to educate me on this this next few days So far I think it is great with many new features So far so good Better improved over the S5 Far better battery life Much better camera More efficient than the S5 A bunch of features All in all the best phone Ive ever owned Very happy Got hacked shortly after buying new phone Is there an anti virus built in Nice phone Can do a lot with That is the best phone on the market that samsung has ever made My download speed is like a turtle All told the Galaxy 7 is a good phone Good memory fast processing and strong battery 

Have had a little glitchy experience with network related issues with text messaging but customer support worked hard to resolve I had to have this phone and I wasnt due for an upgrade until August 2016 Well I paid full price for the phone and I LOVE IT Originally I had the Edge but felt that I was way to clumsy because the phone cover didnt cover the edges complete so I went in and traded it in for the 7 Im glad I did This phone replaced my Galaxy 5 Good phone It dose freeze on some apps but over all its a good phone Takes awesome pictures and is really fast Im very pleased and impressed I Brought 2 s7 edge I did lot of research before buying this phone Best feature of this phone is its design and display display is bright and selfies are awesomely good Never slowed down since 2 months Camera low light pics are unbelievable and camera pro mode is handy Game performance is also nice it keep background app running optimally and due to its ram management work smoothly even opening lots of apps in parallel I recommend this phone if u want best gear vr experience Down side is u need to take care of drops which can be sloved by buying a good case Coming from a Galaxy S6 the S7 is just like its predecessor but in super charged mode 
It feels just like a polished and perfected S6 which was already one of the best phones I had ever used
Battery life is GREATLY improved the phone barely drains at all while it is not in use which is incredible This Phone is highly recommend Phone is very fast has the option to run Google Launcher instead of Touchwiz but the version of Touchwiz is very light and not to intrusive Samsung Pay works great and I havent found anywhere that I cant use it So far I love everything about the phone and couldnt be happier with my purchase Upgraded from S5 that had a microphone issue I am very pleased with the battery life compared to S5 The picture clarity is amazing Only issue I have is that occasionally the ringer mutes itself and I have to restart the phone for it to come back on Got the phone for my mom and she loves it Its a fantastic phone She loves the ease of use and phones features Way to go Samsung Another winner I absolutely love my new S7 This phone has the longest battery life of any phone I have had lasting me literally all day without having to charge Its lighter than my previous phone and easier to use The display is perfect as per usual The speed of the phone is also quite nice The only negative I wish the camera was better I think my camera in my last phone the Note4 was better in every way except for the low light feature available on the new S7 At first thought phone was a little too big for my small hands NOT  The sounds quality is really good on this phone I listen to the radio all the time Once again Samsung does not disappoint I love my New S7 It is truly a beautiful phone and it works wonderfully I bought the phone a couple of weeks ago and it is very slow When Im talking on the phone nobody can hear me Im very unhappy with the galaxy s7 Awesome Phone Besides Locked Bootloader 
Best Phone ive ever owned even with locked bootloader Phone is great Good features good size and long battery life In addition I bought a cover case as well Great phone fast phone I bought this phone a week ago I absolutely love the apps The Samsung heath has been a key app in reviewing my sleep and exercise habits Ive had zero issues thus far Also the camera is amazing Love the sleek feature of this phone  Great pictures  Love the battery life The Galaxy S7 Edge is definitely the best phone that Ive had I love the upgrade I love the battery I love everything about it Ive had all the galaxies but this by far is the best Excellent camera cool features opens apps and loads pages in an instant So happy with this phone Battery life isnt the greatest but I still only have to plug it in at night I like everything about this phone  slim design light weight camera the best and literally EVERYTHING This was my first smartphone but I generally understood what I was getting However I am completely blown away by the quality of this device The camera quality is great as is the display I love the vibrant colors and everything It was a little pricey but it was well worth it for all the functions The samsung galaxy s7 is incredibly useful for my everyday life I can use it to work or for entertainment Happy with up date easy to use The phone features are amazing Lets do less unwanted apps Overall great phone I dont let my kids or wife to touch it yet Every time i find something new to do This phone was an easy transition from my old phone I love it Bought two new phones and both my husband and I am really like them  The camera is amazing and we love the amount of storage  Should have switched sooner The Samsung Galaxy S7 is powerful and has all the features you would want Wireless changing works great With the fat charger provided the S7 is charged quickly to get you back on the go It even has the SD slot for expanding your space The camera is awesome In low light it produces great images This is a phone I am happy I got I used to have iPhones but I dont miss them I love my new Galaxy 7 The phone is great and A great feature is that its water proof Owned for a bit over a week So far
Pros
Good performance 
Finally a BIGGER battery than earlier generations battery life is great over a day with moderate use
Absolutely phenomenal screen Best I have ever seen
Design and edge screen are very sleek I get a lot of compliments
Camera has a semi Pro mode with adjustable ISO and shutter Takes great photos overall Also has RAW mode
Water resistant AND has expandable storage
GearVR software and experience is pretty cool
Fingerprint scanner finally works well no need to swipe
TouchWiz has been much improved in Marshmallow More features eg builtin flash light very little lag the builtin Mail App looks much letter Gallery App is much faster especially when going straight from the camera

Cons
no removable battery
still a lot of bloatware that cant be removed I wish a Play edition was still offered 

Overall this phone has the best hardware you can get at the moment and the software side is near perfect Great phone The operating systems are fast The camera and video give the best resolution and easy to use The phone is lightweight and easy to store in my pocket I am still learning more about this phone and it will greatly enhance my busy life Would totally recommend this to everyone I have never had a smart phone so this is a big learning challenge for me I find the texting difficult to use EX type a letter another letter appears Sending messages took a little bit to figure out All the similar apps are confusing as can be Can not access my yahoo mail Has something to do with my yahoo security protocols It tells me to use a different address but when I try to download it it tells me it is already on the phone but I cant find the programs or apps Granted I am not use to a smart phone so I will just keep earning about it Would be easier if there was a manual for it My daughter picked it up right away and has been able to show me how to do stuff Wow the graphics are great the camera better clarity than my SLR although not as flexible and it is screaming fast Took a bit to get used to the layout and where to find stuff as I am upgrading from an old Galaxy4 but now that I know the phone I have disgraced my friends with the Evil Empire Iphone lastest release and they are jealous Came from an iPhone 6 the transition to android has been seamless and i think this is primarily due to the amazing hardware in the s7 There is no lag present like android devices of the past Very happy with my purchase Visually impaired users will have a very difficult time with this phone  Not enough contrast between print and background print is way too small  Fix those problems and it will be a great phone I replaced my Galaxy S5 with the S7 and Im very happy with that choice

Pros 
Great alwayson clock display
Great battery life
LOVE the fingerprint reader miles better than any Ive seen before
Beautiful display

Cons
Case cant be openedbattery cant be removed this isnt that bad right now because the storage on the battery is so massive and the phone is so powerefficient that I havent missed my replaceable batteriesyet

Im a happy camper  I bought this about a week ago and it didnt comw with a booklet just a website i could go to which was very confussing and not helpful at all I bought this phone a week ago and I am excited to learn more about this phone This phone is easy to use  It also has a good battery life It is so easy to use the S7Edge is truly a work of art I have found the phone to be fast reliable and it takes the most beautiful pictures I switched carriers when I bought the phone and am so happy with the service and with the phone 
If you are wondering whether to get the S7Edge I highly recommend it I bought this 2 weeks ago and keyboard features are annoying Finally they are coming close to a perfect device that in intuitive and intelligent sometimes I love it  and sometimes I hate it  some of the ways you deal with the basics seem counterintuitivebut overall good  Since buying phone I have had to have it replaced due to battery getting to hot  I have to restart almost daily in order to upload photos to facebook Poor cell reception more place than not Love all the new technology Im not sure I want to stay with the Samsung 7s Ive had this phone for about a week Its so much nicer to use than my old one but am still trying to figure out how to get it to talk when Im driving and get a text or call Bought the phone a week ago and love it I do not see anything special on here I like the note edge better Larger screen and easier to use I got my phone a week ago and have been experimenting with it since then  In many ways its quite similar to my previous phone Galaxy S4 but in other ways totally different  I am impressed with how fast the processor on the phone works as well as how fast it charges  I also like the longer life of the battery

Im having some issues with how it syncs email from some of my accounts  When mail is deleted from the Exchange Server it deletes properly from the phone  However when mail is deleted from another server it remains on my phone  Either the sync doesnt recognize the mail is gone or there is a feature somewhere that I have yet to find to toggle

All in all I am super impressed with this phone with its features and with its camera as well  I am not disappointed that I have purchased it its ok but wishing I had gone with something else they made everything more difficult for no reason the simple send text to group now requires you to type in the group name then click each member in the group really wastes time the auto car mode is annoying and cant be shut off even when you turn it off you have to do it again every time pics are great but so large you cant send but one at a time and of course they made it larger so now its like answering a flip flop to your ear they are lucky they got three stars Love my Samsung Any Android is always better than Apple products I hate that Verizon forces you to buy the phone at the full price and in monthly installments Theres no dealsdiscounts anymore on these extremely overpriced phones it works well but does lag at times Still skeptical about the edges and how often my palm may interfere Pandora stops randomly Facebook doesnt work properly Never had these issues with my S6 This is terrible Great performance battery last almost a day and the charging is really fast the screen resolution is really good under any circunstances The phone has many features and is one of the best phones out there The display is just gorgeous and the design of the phone is beautiful Takes great pictures    Easy to use and navigate Transitioning from an iPhone So far so goodStill learning Overall very impressed Love the quick charging For this being a brand new phone that is meant to have a number of great features there are some basic qualities of it that are not up to par For example the battery drains like crazy unless you make A LOT of a adjustments I always have the power saving feature on for example This is something I have never had to do with other phones Another quality I do not like is I cannot get spotify or Overdrive apps to work properly Spotify will not play two songs in a row I have to pick each song manually Overdrive will not download an entire ebook at once I have never had these issues before with other devices These are just main issues I have found in a mere week I like everything except texting  It seems to have a mind of its own autocorrct Im still very new to this phone about a week but so far I love it I upgraded last week and I love it The S7 is the 2ND best android phone on the market Ive been learning something new about this phone everyday especially taking advantage of Samsungs video tutorials The S7 is so easy to navigate I believe anyone would be able to pick it up and use it with ease 
 Ive been showing this phone to anyone that will listen and absolutely recommend it Finally decided to give up my small compact flip phone Ive had the S7 for almost a month and am very pleased with its performance and features Still getting comfortable with the extra size and weight of the S7 compared to my flip phone but do not regret my purchase I traded up from the S5 which gave me great service for two years to the S7 I am finding the battery life to be more than adequate even better than my expectations I like that the calendar and clock apps have been updated I like that the date time and battery usage all show on the phone without the screen being on The dimensions are better for me it seems a bit narrower and lighter The added storage capacity is most welcome The transfer of data contacts messages etc was quite simple with the provided transfer dongle I have always had Galaxy Phones and this is the best phone I have ever used Good battery life and great features I can do everything I want and not worry about a thing Also super durable I used to have an IPhone 6 than switched to the S7 but I really love this Galaxy S7 because how speedy it is And plus its water resistant such an amazing phone Ive only had this phone a week and already cant live without it So glad I finally gave in and traded up Im constantly loosing service my phone calls always have a crackle sound to them Volume sounds off and always low The Settings never seem to stay set Id rather have my S4 back then this phone In my opinion that was the best galaxy phone to date Left a former company whom did not know information about their product I have been with Verizon almost a month Still learning yet so far I am pleased with them Very easy to use  I love it I like how clear are the pictures and how fast it is from what I expect I definitely recommend this Samsung Galaxy s7 very happy with my new phone thanks Samsung Lover the Samsung Galaxies  Have been an devoted Samsung phone users for the last 10 years Photo did not down load The ease of phone color resolution and basic dexterity is fabulous Another over the top A1 product from Samsung Every electronic that I own is Samsung there is no others out there that can even compare Really easy to use and customize
 User friendly and very thought out options Thank you Samsung Love the camera Easytouse Lots of new features I love the phone the case the waterresistance and the protection in case its dropped I traded up from the S5 to the S7 The transition was very smooth Although I miss a couple of things the weather widget with gorgeous photos the wallpaper with the slow moving live purple bubbles and the ring ring phone tone I have the same great performance Plus Verizon is a terrific carrier  I never have the problems of some of my friends who have other carriers Great as expected Samsung keeps getting better and better Pretty new to this Galaxy but already love all that it can do Takes great pictures and I love the quick access edge apps About this a week ago I like it I really like this phone easy to operate and a good size The GS7 has great features and does pretty much everything as well as or better than my prior phone the GS5 the only tech glitch on the GS7 is a strange echo in the sound portion on a few apps I need to figure out which of the other apps is causing this as that seems to be the likely culprit based on some initial research  Porting over all my data and apps took quite a while nearly 3 hours and not everything came over  Samsung needs to get their act together in this respect  the direct data transfer software is slow and glitchy  Also  Samsung  Im very very unhappy that the battery is not removeable  Theres no legit reason for that  I almost didnt buy this phone for that reason alone and next time itll be a dealbreaker Bought Galaxy 7  a week ago Dropped and it cracked Prior samsung 5 was dropped same way many times Never cracked Best android yet Dont know how it could be better Still learning phone but it is a nice uppgrade Bought this phone 2 weeks ago and it is great I have this phone for a week and just love it Great phone no complaints Battery life is horrible
But overall is just like the s5 and s6 which I like I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 about 1 week ago and I am so glad I did I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a high end smartphone Phone is not compatible with my car do not like format of the phone wish I bought an iPhone did not know I only had 2 weeks to switch Phone is still in great condition as I bought a case to protect it If there is anything you can do to help me switch back to an Apple product please let me know I miss my iPhone Got it love love it never go anywhere without it I have had the phone for a couple of weeks and I love it I have had no problems with the battery life like I read about I dont know why I didnt update sooner I bought this to replace an older IPhone which was no longer working  I love the WiFi connection that allows me to receive phone calls and text messages at home where we do not have cellular coverage  This is a great feature Had to many issues with my HTC spouse recommended Galaxy This is a great phone Easy to handle easy to use for the most part Trying to xfer pics from my phone to my pc is a chore And saving appointments and dates from the old phone is next to impossible I have always loved my Windows phone But now I can get some useful apps that were untouchable I also have found I get a very strong and clear signal in some spots my Lumia us useless in Easy setup and quick data transfer from old cell to new cell Battery charges super fast and last a long time Phone proforms well with a strong signal and amazing clarity There is no borderedge on the S7 When I hold the side of the phone I accidentally press numbers or letters This causes frustration when texting while holding the phone or using the keypad when on a call There are not many upgrades that I notice with the exception of the camera when compared to the S5 The only positive is if logged into Samsung all apps numbers photos messages etc transfer Prices are better at competitors with included accessories when compared to purchasing through Verizon Ive had this phone for 17 days  Its my 3rd Samsungmaybe my 4th Its already quirky  The touch screen is either overly sensitive or delayed at recognizing touches then rushes to catch up I have a pattern lock on it and yesterday it wouldnt recognize the correct password pattern  Other times when I unlock it random apps I havent open are open on the screen  2x now Ive unlocked it and it automatically calls a random contact  I will be going into my local store to see if they can help me  Ive heard great things about the 7 Edge Stay away from the regular 7 From an ardent HTC fan I really do love this phone  CAMERA IS GREAT  Now if it will only last as long as my HTC M8 This phone is the best I am still loving the new features Super fast Internet Can play any game with confidence Easy to use its a Samsung Love all Samsung devices Great phone
Lost my old phone I just bought this phone and I am very happy with it We bought this a week ago and my husband and I got the same phone we both are so happy with it Only this is wish you could have your own ring tones I was due 4 an upgrade 4 over a year  I finally did itsamsung 7 is a steller phoneas this is my 1st smartphone I cant compare it 2 others Easy 2 learnuser friendlythe fast battery charging system is totally a AWESOME featureHD is unrealmegapixels r out of this world I have used Samsung phones for quite a while I used to have a bit of jealousy concerning the iphone because of a few of the useful apps and tools it had That jealousy is now gone My daughter carries the iphone 6s and now she no longer waves some feature at me In fact the camera and power ability of the 7 Edge is just wonderful Thank you Emergency purchase when lost phone  Didnt think of a different brand I recently bought this phone I must say I really like it I had a galaxy s5 before this phone This is a much nicer phone I would recommend it to anyone I love the phone  I love Samsung as well I bought a month ago  and is been great I bought a week ago and it has been great I like the opportunity to get acquainted  to the device  seek customer service for all other options Ive only had it a little over a week but so far I love it I would recommend the S7 over the Iphone any day   So much easier to use got it last month and love it Super fast Long battery life Perfect size Had a Galaxy 6 upgraded and completely satisfied Ive only had this for a week and am quite frustrated I cant add my own ring tones even though Im following the Google advice Ive purchased two songs and neither have downloaded Even though I made a commitment to turn in my old phone imessage thinking of spending the money and sending this back and keeping my iPhone The s7 has a lot of good features Although its missing some features like what the s5 and s6 had I would still say its a great phone I am happy I bought the S7  very pleased This is such an amazing phone it is extremely quick and the call quality on it is crystal clear It works great with the vr gear I had the s5 active and now have the s7 active Bother devices are awsome Really like the phone So far the phone itself is all I expected it to be   The transfer of the apps their data my files and my login information was far from satisfactory  No login info was transferred  Some not all apps were transferred  App data seems to have been mostly transferred but not visible until login is achieved  Make sure you have all your passwords available to you I just a couple of days ago received my Samsung Galaxy S7 I love this phone Ive owned a S3 and S4 galaxys are my favorite phones The S7 is amazing the screen is  vibrant and easy to see camera is by far the very best Easy to operate and the technology is fanominal Finger print to unlock youre phone is so amazing its worth the money I promise I loved my Samsung S5 but overtime it became slower and needed replaced I live that the S7 is the pretty much the same but improved Loving this phone fast and awesome If I was aware the S7 had a non removable battery my S5 had a replaceable battery I never would have bought it This basically means that after two years this phone is garbage and if you dont want to charge it twice a day you will be shopping for a new one Replaced my s5 active that I loved the s7 is even better great battery life quick processor very durable dropped it plenty of times with no damage I had the phone for 2 days already and love from the screen to the camera clarity to the features it offer Display kept flashing on with ads etc until I locked  Still getting unwanted ads  Ran up over 1 Gig of data charges without my knowledge What to say about this complete device 
1st beautiful device 
Memory awesome since you cancan add a memory card
Easy to use
Quality of the calls awesome
And the Battery waouh I have never had a phone with such a lasting memory I I had the S4 Huge difference  Very fast and easy to navigate  My phone though dose not work with headphones  I need to bring it back and have it checked Ive been a galaxy customer for years This phone is another reason Ill be a galaxy customer for years to come Not happy with battery life does not last a day The camera is great  Tphone has great battery life This is my first experience with the Android operating system and may I say what a great platform Having previously used another platform I can tell you there is no comparison between them Many more features than were previously used to The control over applications is stellar I will never go back to another platform again Thank you Samsung for creating a great phone that utilizes all the potential of the Android platform This is a great phone I love Samsung Galaxy S7 It has great built in features I love the added durability of the S7 and the camera is quite an improvement Look forward to adding an SD card for the expanded memory Impressive performance and features Carrier apps that cannot be installed are annoying The transition from my S4 mini over to the S7 was really smooth and the  video graphics are so much better Very glad I made the upgrade I love the new S7 especially water resistant expandable memory and spectacular camera Its fast and performance level is phenomenal Love it Love it over my note 4 Ive had for the last 2 years enjoying the smaller size and especially love all the great camera features as well I had to purchase updated phone for work purposes and was advised to go Android since all other devices are Android  Was told the Galaxy S7 would suit me better than the EdgeI didnt need all the Edge features  My local store walked me through the basics and transferred all my contacts as a courtesy   So far the battery life is less than expected  automatic updates go through it quickly and require midday recharges unless you know to schedule them when at home  Am not used to having to manually have to close each app upon exiting  other devices do that automatically  If you dont close them they add to the battery drain  Also lost 6 favorite contacts one night when phone was not in use  no clue why  Have had to reinput contacts since new system sorted them differently than original device  again no clue why  Have no major complaints beyond battery life and expect I will appreciate features once I become more familiar with them  Would recommend to someone experienced on smartphones but to a novice only with training Not too bad although the battery life is not very good Very glad I upgraded my phone I just got last week and had issues with first one  Got to take it in to Verizon and get a new one  So still learning everything on the phone Purchased 2 weeks ago  upgraded from S4 Great choice to stay Samsung When I purchased this phone I thought  it was going to be challenging  to use but it has proven me wrong it is easy to use and very smart Ive had this phone for 5 days and I love it Its beautiful and fast Im so glad the micro SD card slot is back though its 32gb is so much better than the 16gb that my Galaxy S5 had This phone has so many great features I love the themes that you can download Very happy Easy transfer and transition from the galaxy s4 i do occasionally use text messaging but not whiile i am driving the message that my friends receive most of the time is that i an driving and cannot answer their messae this occurs even when i am at home i am unable to locate a way to turn this app off Everything  I expect8 Great phone and features The battery life is poor Tne battery discharges even when the phione is turned off This is such an improvement over my old phone different brand  night and day Love it Great phone Has everything I was looking for in a phone My husband and I are absolutely satisfied with the brilliant line of Samsung Galaxy phones Thank you for bringing innovative technology to our fingertips This is my first Android device I was attracted to it from my iPhone 6s Plus based mostly on the camera specs and battery size On the camera and specs it delivers The camera is best on the market The phone has incredibly good hardware and is very fast I want to love it I want to brag about it There are two major things however that keep from doing so

1  The battery life This phone has a bigger battery than my 6s Plus had However it has far less than half the battery life The reviews made it seem better but real world its not My 6s Plus was getting 910 hours of screen on time per charge I am doing good on this one to get 3 and a half or 4 hours screen on time Standby time on this phone is far worse than the 6s Plus too I could overall get two full days on my 6s Plus before needing to charge again On this one Im having to charge by about 3pm with light to moderate usage I dont know what model the tech reviewers got but in real world the ATT model is garbage for battery life

2  The bloatware My goodness the bloatware Samsung has so much junk on this thing its no wonder the battery suffers They have decided to put their version of almost every Google app what people really want pure Android alongside the Google apps you actually want and you cannot remove the Samsung apps no matter what you do aside from rooting  which you also cant do since they mistakenly decided people want Samsung payKnox rather than having the ability to delete the junk off their phones Its not just that theres effectively two of every app  the pure Android version and Samsungs version its that Samsungs versions are horrifically bad and you cant remove or even disable most of them Touchwiz being the biggest offender but theyre all bad 

The phone itself feels great in hand Its solid well made and I like it better than my 6s Plus However its the first and last Samsung device Ill buy until they remedy their bloatware and related the horrible battery life in real world use Again the reviews were great thats why I bought it But whatever S7 Edge they got in the labs and tech reviews must have been unicorns because the real world version doesnt come near living up to it Itll be a Nexus device next time or back to iOS Not sure which yet Samsung built great hardware but they go against everything the Android experience is about Im still trying to figure out how to do all the cool things my S4 did and I cant find them I got my phone Fathers day weekendthe bill is really high but the phone is greatI wish I would of had something like this years ago Great phone Easy to use Great new features Very easy to use Thoroughly pleased I had better signal strength on my old first gen HTC One I already cracked the screen in the 1st week of having it but honestly this phone is amazing Ive never been at full satisfaction with a cellular device like I am now Thanks Samsung even though the new screen will cost an arm and a leg Overall I will continue to by galaxy phones Keep upn the good work Transition was seamless and quick to pickup This phone is better then any other options lightweight and stylish after owning my s7 for only one week I am totally satisfied Samsung has got it to the T Just terrific device very fast intuitive and has so much functions Not only its easy to use but it also makes you very priductive with so many useful apps

Plus it has dust and water resistannt design and longlasting battery and the best camera out there in the market

Samsung products just rocks Sayonara Apple now that Steve Jobs has gone to rest Edge and market shareis definitely swinging on Samsungs way Dosent ring Rings too softly Loses contacts 
Great camera Does not hold a charge very long I have found my new phone to be an easy transition overall It is faster at charging holds the charge longer and is similar enough yet better than the former one I love the ease of use  The phone gets warm quickly but other than that it is awesome I am the envy of all my friends The camera and display are outstanding Puts all others to shame I have had this phone for four days and the screen cracked Love the s7 wasnt going to get an upgrade but when I saw the s7 I wanted it Finally replaced my 3S Jumped to the 7 A lot of improved features Recommended this phone Easy to use Love the Samsung S7 Traded in an S5 which was great but had become slow  was running out of space S7 has a greatly improved camera for low light  32GB of storage Fast  sleek Go Samsung All the bells  whistles No bloatware to speak of w lots of choices for add on apps Bought 2 of the S7s around a month ago for wife and myself We both like the quality I am not a person who is enthralled with phones to me they are a necessary evil But that is no reason to not get the best I believe that the Galaxy S7 is the best out there right now The camera is really great I found there was a slight learning curve after having years using a phone made by another wellknown company but that is not a fault Im just pointing it out Im not really sure how to comment on the design I mean it is a cell phone were not talking cars or jet airplanes here The size is just right nice easytoread display and the weight in my pocket is perfect The picture gallery features are great no additional apps needed I wish I could figure out how to get rid of the tag line in my emails that lets the world know what kind of phone and carrier I have its kind of embarrassingly silly I am glad I bought this phone and I would recommend to anyone who wants the best The s7edge has many features that make it an outstanding cell phoneIt is by far the best cell phone I ever had This is my second Samsung and they keep getting better I love this phone its quick and has done everything I wanted it to and more the only 2 draw backs I have found is battery life and it would be nice to have a stylus Its taking more time to learn than my Galaxy 5 Phone is great So clear and the pictures are great  Battery life is fantastic Phone functions well except keyboard Large fingers cause mistakes We bought this for my husband He has had no complaints and so far loves it I held out a long time before getting a smartphone and Id have to say this was a good choice Only adjustment I had to make is the backup button was on the opposite side of the phone compared to what I was used to I have been an avid iPhone user for quite some time but decided to switch to Samsung based on recommendationsome from friends  It has not disappointed  Screen is beautiful  Camera is fantastic  It was an easy transition from Apple My S5 was a great phone an the S7 is even better Smooth transition and even easier to use Ease of use and security of thumbprint recognition is a nice touch Sound is good speed is quick Change from a note 5 to the S7 like the size much better Performances is great camera is even better I like the way the phone feels the size and look of it  Im still trying to figure things out I wish I had gone to the Samsung center for orientation in Best Buy  I may go back and do that The S7 is the right size phone with all the features that you could ask for I like to keep my phone in my front pocket and this phone is the perfect size for that It has an amazing processor and great resolution which helps when you are reviewing documents on the run Have had Iphones for years First Non Iphone Love it I bough this phone not long agoand still not just to it Sorry i like iphone more much better  I bought this phone about a week ago and I wish that I got the Galaxy S7 Edge Everything transferred from my Galaxy S5 but the S7 is not finding my contacts when making a hands free bluetooth phone call  This has to be fixed or I may be trading it back for reconnection to my S5 My new phone exceeds all my expectations My old phone was a Samsung Galaxy S 5 The S7 is in all ways is a better phone I Really enjoy my new phone with all its great features I have been a HTC customer for many years but the reviews on the S7 convinced me to switch I do miss my front loaded speakers on the HTC but the speaker on this phone is adequate I love the organization and the ease of navigation The feel of this phone is great and the display is fantastic Im still experimenting with the settings to my personal likes and the flexibility in this area is great Overall I am very happy with this new phone I have not used the Samsung Pay feature yet Im curious about what others have experienced using this feature I feel the Samsung Galaxy S7 is an over all good phone in respect to preformance and overall value in comparison with other phones on the market Im happy Samsung brought back the memory slot on its new line of S phones but dismayed at the inability to switch out the battery The S7s permanently mounted battery is one less option as far as Im concerned Also Im happy about the expandable memory slot but i have had some issues with apps wiring with data on the memory chip It would be great if the phone would work as well with information on the memory chip as it does with data stored on the device Over all happy with the phone Like always I love samsung devices I have had a TV watch phone tab and the s7 helps keep me connected Swinched from iPhone 6 to s7 and wasnt impressed The S7 Edge is the new note 4 It has a smaller screen but still has the power to do all the things you like The S7 Edge is the new note 4 because it has a better battery life than the note 4 Upgraded from a Droid Turbo and am very glad I did The graphics capabilities of the Galaxy S7 are amazing Videos are crisp and clear photos are beautiful Im expecting delivery of my Samsung VR headset tomorrow and plan to spend the weekend playing with it as well Cant wait to see what my S7 can do with the VR headset Great phone everything I wanted Newer and more updated version of my old Galaxy S5 I bought this because I was in need of a replacement when my s4Note was damaged I would have chosen an s5Note but I was told I wouldnt be able to use my SD card The s6Note will have all that I need so Im eagerly looking forward to its release Why is this screen guard cracked in the upper right corner already I havent even dropped the phone The battery life is NOT as impressive in duration as I thought although it charges  faster I do not like the limited volume The location of the speaker makes it hard to hear the phone ring or audio play when the phone is face up on a flat surface and why could I not choose a simple ring tone that actually sounds like a phone ring rather than an alarm tone or some music I may ignore A few photos come out questionably blurred and retakes are always necessary in dim light indoors I have not found the wow factor of this phone yet  It seems basic Not impressed I am missing lots of my contact cell numbers to text me I am getting text messages but not able to know who it is or am looking for someones number and only have their email FRUSTRATING I like it I just worry it heats too much when its charging Upgraded from the Galaxy S4  Hated not having a user removable battery and the left hot button being changed from Menu to SwitchClose Application  Higher speed water resistance  better camera a little bit bigger display and longer battery my old one was reallygetting tired were nice improvements The Galaxy s7 is a wonderful phone with a ton of great features for a much more reasonable price than its biggest competitors Nice application fast but difficult transition from IPhone to Galaxy S7least for me anyway Travel two S7 phones each setup was different Think they would be the same Speaker not as loud as iphone Love this phone so far Ive only had it for a few weeks so I was hesitant to give it fie stars  I was an apple user that needed a more technical device  This phone definitely takes some time to mess with and understand the system workings but each new feature I discover seems brilliant like the screenshot swipe love it  I am highly satisfied  My only complaint is that the phone only comes with the supercharge accessories these allow a full charge in about an hour And that isnt too severe a complaint  The battery normally lasts all day At this time I am enjoying the Samsung 7  Great photos and great battery life Having owned the Samsung Galaxy S4 the last 3 years I was looking forward to upgrading to the S7 I am not disappointed The phone is familiar but yet has new features such as Samsung pay which I am enjoying using The S7 is very responsive and quick The battery life is much better than my old S4 Its probably a good thing because the battery in the S7 is not user replaceable Hopefully that wont be an issue I feel confident I have a great product again Love my Samsung Galaxy S7  This is my 3rd Droid  Never going back to iPhone i needed a new phone as my S5 was getting slow and had glitches so i upgraded to the S7 and i just love it user friendly sharp screen great features and the camera rocks this was a birthday present to myself and im very happy I made this choice Easy to use  Always there when I need it I bought this a week ago after trading in an iPhone 6s plus I bought and Im so happy I did This is much better than iphone Ive had it for a week I reminds me of what would happen if iPhone and Android had a baby I hated my iPhone 5s The swipe keyboard is horrible like the 5s If you turn on the battery saver function it still rips through the battery compared to my Maxx Leave the battery saver off and you will be charging it at lunch This is just my first impression It does have some nifty little functions to play around with but nothing you cant just download an app and have the same nifty little function Im probably going to take it back and get the droid turbo 2 Phone is not very durable but it functions very well an has great picture an awesome camera Ive had a Samsung S5 and loved it The S7 is wonderful The fluidity of the operating system is not satisfying to me Email push is slow and the messaging apps are not utilitarian Simply put Android is not a productive communication system It is an alternative to the iPhone and that is it My Blackberry was a productive communication devicesystem that was designed for phoneemailmessaging Android has more apps but even with that it isnt fluid and relies too much on wifi to be accomodating I bought this a week ago and already HATE it so slow cant never keep a charge onot it Best phone I have owned yet Im getting one bar on 4G and dropping callsId recommend trying a different phone I have had this for a couple weeks and absolutely love it Its a very sturdy phone yet small and sleek It appears to be made well with a metal backing instead of the prior plastic ones Resolution is very good and the screen is responsive and the sensitivity is appropriate Fast processing and the UI is refined from the version on my old Note 4 New features make doing common things faster like attaching a photo to a text message or email A small thing but still  the calculator app is better on this phone Battery life will not last more than 5 hours Iphone battery life is better that galaxy s7 Only had this phone for about 10 days The battery life is not all that great First off I bought this phone because it had expandable memory and it will get the latest Android software However the expandable storage is absolutely useless Everytime I reset my phone or my phone dies the SD card is corrupted Because of this I lost a lot of pictures all my childs 2nd birthday   I use the auxiliary cable and Bluetooth a lot due to the fact I travel for work  This phone annoyingly decides what my volume should be at I am 34 years old I do not need someone to tell me how loud I want my volume When you do go past the absolutely ridiculous warning it seems to reset itself periodically My phone is on my Dash in a Cell booster So not only is it annoying it is also dangerous for me to fumble with the phone constantly to hear my work calls  Needless to say that I will never be purchasing a Samsung again I have been a loyal HTC customer sense the first Android operating system I chose to go astray A mistake I will not be repeating I bought this phone a month agoI love all the features that the phone is equipped with My problem is that I have no service any where I go I dont know if its the device or Verizon itself Its frustrating to switch to a network that prides themselves on service then to switch to that network to have dropped calls and unable to send text messages I had a 4S active I loved it I upgraded to the S7 So far I have really enjoyed the product I like being able to cut apps off with the touch of a button I love the battery saver functions If I use the through out the day My battery will last all day I like the camera really clear I have to remember if Im listening to Samsung Milk music I have to cut the battery save mode off so that it will stay functioning I like the capability of expand my memory if needed Just took some time getting used to it when I swapped from iPhone to Samsung but am actually living it more Starts off good but slows down with minimum usage  I had an iPhone 5c with is the worst iPhone ever and got frustrated  I should have went with the iPhone 6  Going back as soon as my contract is up  iPhone is SO much user friendly ESPECIALLY if your into music I really like this phone easy to use right out of box and transferring information from old phone to new one was easy The s7 is amazing Love the water resistant feature Has great support on line and at best buy kiosk Also love how sleek it is Camera produces stunning photos Our 8x10 photo book looks as though we used a dslr camera Lots more to learnprobably until the next model Have this phone since end of Mayreplacing the S3 LOVE IT I really have enjoyed having the S7 I upgraded from a S3 and couldnt be more thrilled The phone is easy to use and has great features Its different from the S3 so there is some getting use to the new featuresbut the help feature has come in handy I was way overdue for a phone upgrade and this phone is incredible Easy to get up to speed thanks to the expect service at Verizon I adore this phone Responsive  fast and easy to useThe camera features are great especially the low light shooting and voice activation of the shutter I find battery life to be adequate and I run LOTS of apps I also love the potential to expand to so much more memory my second Samsung phoneI am a customer for life  I love everything about this phone especially the fact that it is not an edge product The only complaint i have and I dont really think it is an issue with the phone but for the last 2 weeks or so I have been having a lot of trouble with bad reception with calls only but I have talked to several people on Verizon and they have been having the same issue so I think it may just have been the atmosphere since it has improved over the last couple of days Overall it is a great phone Still learning the ins and outs Contact list setup is great camera is great  USER has fewer tech skills since retiring LOL I bought this phone number 2 weeks ago Im still trying to understand it cuz its new to me but it it is doing a real good job I have had my phone now for 2 weeks and have had no problems Love my new phone Takes great pics and videos Would highly recommend this product Lots of dropped calls have problems connecting to Internet especially using phone as hot spot for other devices  when talking the person Im talking to often cant hear me unless I put speaker on This phone is absolutely great Its very sturdy and very beautiful I love how this phone looks It is easy navigating through the different functions Love the flashlight option camera and video recorder is good Was originally skeptical of the headphones included with phone but after several uses i am pleased with them So much fun to use super fast for home use and my work email Love the edge access and so glad able to add extra storage when needed although 32GB is nice Speaker are excellent too The camera takes real life photosits almost like you are in the picture looking at it like you can feel whatever you took a picture of The edge is so appealing Its nice Even if you wanted the regular s7 the edge just seems to draw you in 

Beautiful device No question But the all glass How practical is that No removable battery That means when the battery deteriorates then you have to get another very very expensive phone And no IR BLASTER huge bummer

Also There are no cases and or screen protectors that do justice because of the edge screen Very dissatisfied 

But over all the phone is nice The quality is the best And its Samsung The most trusted Brand The Galaxy S7 Edge is Samsungs best smartphone to date by far Its absolutely amazing Its the most well polished devices theyve ever made The design is beautiful the camera is phenomenal the features such as waterdust resistance and Samsung pay work effortlessly Its just an all around great phone This smartphone is amazing The camera takes crisp clear precise photos Love it I like it but my hand under my thumb hits the edge Maybe I am not holding it right Love the bigger screen We had the phone for about a week now and getting the hang of it Smooth transition from the S5 love it so far Great phone First smart phone and sorry I didnt do it sooner now that it is so much easier than I anticipated I bought this phone a few weeks ago service is great except losing service in stores and not getting service back after being out of the store for a while I love the galaxy s7 edge The lighting on the phone is bright but is never overbearing The phone runs and works great and the camera is amazing Doesnt matter whether you use front or rear camera they are both clear The only thing is sometimes I feel like it is slow responding to my back button and the phone gets hot easily Otherwise I cant find a thing to complain about and Im really excited I switched Very pleased with the phone This phone is awesome So fast awesome camera Great size and durable I was told this was a great phone and I am so happy that I bought it Best phone ever Love the features on the phone only buzz kill Is the otterbox cover they persuaded me to buy  This has a nice cover but the gorilla glass traps hair etc under the glass Upgrade from a Galaxy 4 and Im glad I did I love EVERYTHING about this phone especially the long battery life This phone is and has everything and more than I expected Outstanding camera  tons of features and a lot of fun I had my old Samsung Galaxy crappie out  Impressed with speed and the new features I have been using Galaxy Notes since the first one I was not sure to go to the S series since I used to love the SPen But I broke my las note so had to upgrade but decided for the S7 Edge amazing phone fast responsive simply love it specially the edge menu Love the phone just what i was looking for From tablets to cameras Ive had many electronic devices Yet none of them outperform the Samsung Galaxy S7 None of them even come close The features are so good I dont even use my digital camera anymore because the camera on this phone is amazing The colors are so vibrant and the focus is so good Eternally the phone is so easy to use Ive accomplished many things that I would would have known existed on the IPhone Such as transfer music files from my computer and transfer photos from my camera I am honestly in love with this phone and it would be amazing if I was able to buy more Samsung products I would even recommend this product to even the oldest living being they would probably understand way more than thy would on other phones I also love the design its so big and slim It fits in my pockets and fits perfectly in my hand its not to big but its not to small Its just right So in conclusion if you are looking into buying a Samsung product I highly recommend it I fall in love with this phone Awesome features great to ouch and surface I have had several Samsung phones They just keep making them better every couple of years when I upgrade This phone works great It takes quality pictures and has good sound quality Devoted Motorola user Switched for water resistance and camera I am very pleased I have only had the phone for a week  Things are much harder to find than my old flip phone This is the best phone ive had in years glad i made the switch from an iphone to the galaxy s7 having a water resistant device is awesome I donot have to worry about it getting wet and dying on me I love the look and style of this phone It chargespecially quick and battery lifemail is longer The camera is awesome Love the fact that it is waterproof I love the camera waterproofing and just how quick the phone is Also the battery is much improved from the s6 Great phone better than the s6 would like it if android had an easy way to add iTunes to the phone though I bought  this and love it I just got the S7 and I find it really easy to use lightweight great picture quality and overall just a great phone  The only frustration is the fingerprint reader which almost never works  Otherwise I am happy with it Really great camera and user friendlyexcellent display I love this phone I have been using another brand and owned three of their phones in the past The newest model was not supported by my carrier so I had to look around I was really taken by the S7 Edge at the store Really nice clear display Perfect size for me Very happy to move up to 55 inch display I was really impressed by the S6 edge my friend purchased last year but the S7 looked even better to me I own a lot of other Samsung products and am happy with them but the Galaxy line used to be kind of cheap looking and I didnt like them much The S6 and S7 however have made huge improvements in materials and build quality so I really like them

Now Im sold I really like the look and feel of this phone The touch wiz interface is fine with me The display is the best Ive ever had The screen even seems to get fingerprints less than other phones Speaking of fingerprints I love the fingerprint scanner Use it all the time Great for unlocking the phone and can also be used for signing into web sites when using the stock browser I really like the edge menus too Also great camera with lots of pro options 4K is nice although I dont use that much Decent low light as well as outdoor performance I also like that the phone is water resistant even though I hope never to have to worry about that I purchased the wireless charger and really love using it Battery life is good too Always makes it through the day and leaves a little extra just in case

With all the years that Ive been buying electronic stuff Im convinced this is a great product and probably the best phone ever so far have enjoyed this tabletnot bad for a relatively inexpensive tablet Coming from The Samsung Galaxy S4 the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge 32GB ATT Silver Titanium makes the day to day use of a Phone faster and easier with all the new updates to the features of the phone I have no complaints and would recommend this phone to anyone and everyone Big difference going from a two year old phone Speed of the phone is about double After phone has been turned off and then turned back on after awhile it does not always bring up the email messages that were missed I have had the note since the Note 2 came out and this phone was enough to pull me away from them There is soo much to know it will take me 4 or 5 weeks to learn There is so much more to the S7 than I had ever imagined The graphics are awesome The response on the screen is super fast Before I begin all the pros of the device here is my con I am not a fan of the surface traction of the S7 I usually dont allow my phone to be a nudist but this one is so pretty to me I caved and didnt buy a case for it which I regret However other than its tendency to attempt to run away on most surfacesits an awesome phone The picture quality is amazing Its not too big or too small and is the perfect size for the dual app option it offers I love it Inavative products always on the cutting edge of technology 1 I have had every Samsung Galaxy S phone and they just keep getting better This phone has a sleek design that anyone could use Every part of this phone is amazing and fast 10 out of 10 would buy again Just got the phone on the 12th June and I really enjoy it Great product very easy to understand features
love the movable picture feature but sometimes it captures a gray screen not sure why but i take multiple pictures so its probably a learning curve thing For a guy that was a Fan of another competitors OS and Phone This is now my GoTo phone With sleek design bright vibrant screen and power in the device This puts IPhone to shame Got this phone a couple weeks ago because the battery life on my old phone was not goodI think the old phone may have had better battery life  Really not happy
I have closed everything out that I know and use the power save Had the phone about a week Love how clear the text is on Facebook  etc But having trouble reading email  very small font  Phone is noticeably heavier than the S5 I had which I dont like Miss some of the features on the clock and phone or in just havent figured it out yet Also why is voice mail so difficult If i had it to do ovet again not sure I would have made the same choice Got it couple weeks ago and easier then my lgg4 sleek and efficient has a very nice design Great camera There are some slight disadvantages to the phone it is very light and slippery I have dropped it several times  I have since added a Mophie  which eliminated the minor issue Just got week ago easy to use and fast This is my first smartphoneso Im getting used to it The more I play  the more It can do Dont need my laptop with me anymore Bought this phone a month ago and I absolutely  love  it Quite simply the best samsung phone ever Easy to use lots of memory battery life is amazing If you dont have it you need it I bought it over two weeks ago to replace my Galaxy III This S7 is a replacement for my S5 It has significantly better battery life and even with moderate to heavy use during the day will hold a charge all day long The camera is incredible and takes better photos than my digital camera With an added microSD card it has plenty of room for apps and photos 

After daily use for about a month Im quite pleased with its speed I dont have the lag or freezing issues I experienced with the S5 

With the S5 I had constant issues with not being able to be heard when on a phone call I had to shout or use a Bluetooth headset The S7 does not have this problem and I can hold a phone conversation at normal speaking volume

The hefty price tag was hard to swallow but I do love my new phone I used my Galaxy S4 for over 2 yrs and I was very happy with it but it was time for something newer and better My new S7 is everything I was hoping it would be Its very user friendly logical and easy to navigate It also has a great selection of apps and functions to help with almost anything I love my new Galaxy S7 This phone is incredible as far as speed and usability The only thing is that the edge phones are more likely to have their screens Crack when dropped but just get a decent case aND youll never have a problem with this phone Works like a charm and many upgrades from previous version Ive had this phone for about 2 months and am loving it There are great automated features like S health to track sleep food and exercise the only issue that I have with it is that certain programs wont work when the lock screen is up Pandora frequently wont play the next song which didnt happen with my old phone the ability to instruct others is what is lacking at Samsung  find your Carl Sagan  sooner rather than later good phone with many options I have been using this phone for about two weeks upgraded from a Samsung III I love it It is so easy to close apps access info etc Have been using it so much more Have no complaints I think it is a solid phone that works well with lots of great features I have 2 phones and one of them is an iPhone 6s plus I compare the two often The one thing that is disappointing is the battery life of the S7 Edge I purchased it because of the large battery and thought it would surpass my iPhone It does not come close This maybe because of the operating system IOS to Android I do not watch videos or play games during the day I do use it for work and receive many emails text messages and reminders so I do need it to last I just thought since I do not stream music or watch videos I would get a lot more out of the battery I am so happy with Samsung I previously has the S4 and had no problems with it and now I have the S7 and I love it I love this phone It has great features and it was an incredible upgrade from my Galaxy S3 I really like the features Latest and greatest device
Water resistant 
Great pictures 
Expandable storage
Good on battery I have had this phone for a few months now I love it I love the size The color and resolution on the display are great I had a note 1 and note 3 previously and this is a great upgrade for me cause I love the features of my android phone but wanted something smaller than the note Very pleased I love that it is a lot faster  smoother than ever known issues that havent been fixed its not what i was expecting Love the Samsung Galaxy s7 Good processor and overall performance Screen is just the right size not too big or too small just right It has all the features you would need on a smartphone and more Its even better connected to a samsung gear watch I honestly think this phone is way better than the note 5 It has a faster processor better quality camera and the you can do things some other phones just cannot do This is my fourth Galaxy S device that Ive owned By far the S7 Edge surpasses all of my expectations Bringing back the SD card option is a huge plus The processor is very fast the fingerprint scanner is flawless and night camera superb If you are looking for a high quality product full of features look no more Its the Galaxy S7 Edge Verizon network over rated its the best galaxy so Far goes great with virtual reality Love the color Just purchased my new Galaxy 7s Edge and absolutely love it its very powerful lightweight and stylish I highly recommend it to everyone This phone looks great and I have been getting compliments from all of my friends I have and will definitely recommend this product to anyone I brought the phone a week ago and I like the phone but Im having a hard time with the volume Love my s7 edge its easy n fun to use so many things to do on it I love this phone I upgrade every year and am never disappointed The screen is so bright and vivid So many new and better features than my S4 I especially lIke the new themes feature The fast cable charging is about 20 faster than regular slow charge but it has an annoying pause and start thing it does When fast charging it constantly makes that charge starting sound effect Other than that I have no complaints I also love the always on feature of the screen The new keyboard has made me a faster and more accurate typer I enjoy the 7edge The battery life is great Pictures are sharp and clear Screen size is good and the edge apps are convenient and easy to use I also got the VR goggles with the phone and they are pretty amazing also I have been using Samsung products for years and I will continue Their products are dependable and high functioning I was disappointed that ms gs5 was getting slow and initially i had bought the black version of the phone but it had a really bad battery issues and wouldnt go into sleep mode nad often overheat After returning it for a new one this phone works wonderfully I have used Samsung phones for years now and I love this phone Its easier than ever to transfer data from your old phone to your new one and the camera is amazing The only downsides Ive found so far are 1 the universal remote Peel Smart Remote is not an option compared to the Galaxy S5 2 the Always On is a waste  it drains the battery an additional 1 hour that might not seem like a lot but when youre trying to make the battery last  are unaware of its effect it makes a difference and 3 having the Power Saver on all the time and using ATT text message syncbackup slow the phone down Im sure the last 2 are on other phones as well but its something I was unaware of until I got the S7 I decided to go right after my birthday and choose a new phone There were problems with the battery After charging the battery the battery would automatically lose 2 of energy without me doing anything It became a nuisance The screen was great I loved it But the battery was the key factor of returning the phone and going back to my iPhone

Note I love their tablets Broke the screen and planning to get another one The Greatest Piece of Tech Ive had the pleasure of holding I love that its fast The graphics and the hd are amazing its super fast never freezes The only thing I dont like is the battery life  this tho by far is the best phone Ive ever had Good job This phone to my old one is like comparing a broken Ford Pinto to a Aston Martin Vanquish The battery lasts me at least 2 days the camera takes awesome pictures the display is crystal clear and it is a good size with out being too big Even with a Otterbox it fits comfortably in a shirt pocket The S7 edge is everything I expected and more after having an iPhone for so long So I had the S6 Edge and just upgraded to the S7 Edge and man it is beautiful The battery life is amazing I went from charging multiple times a day to not having to recharge on a normal day and this is using all the features that the 7 offers like the always on screen Ive always loved the design its just a little bigger this time on the 7 However it isnt that big that it wasnt comfortable to carry around 

Definite buy in my book I wasnt expecting the battery to be this good especially since the screen also increased in size from the previous version I purchased this from ATT and its a great product to use I was afraid of switch to Samsung from Apple iPhone but I decided to try something new and it was a very great idea to try Samsung phones Great pictures great capacity the sound quality isnt that good but its ok So cool and the 4G LTE network on ATT its very very fast Get your own Galaxy Youll love it I just LOVE my new cell phone Galaxy 7Edge is easy to use sleek in design lightweight  I LOVE the bigger screen Also water resistant  I had the galaxy S5 prior to getting this phone and loved the S5 But the S7 is 10 times better The camera is incredible and the resolution is amazing Love the fact you can have the camera take a couple seconds of video prior to the shot It is pretty awesome plus these are the most crystal clear pictures I have taken The ease of use is amazing as well In fact I upgraded my wifes phone as well to the S7 and convinced my cousin to leave his apple behind and get the S7 as well which he did And he loves his new phone and is happy he made the switch The screen size feels huge but at the same time the size of the phone is still practical Readability is excellent Quick and easy to figure out Still need to figure out all the features yet but am very happy with the essentials Processor is quite a step up from my old S4 Thus phone is everything to me it is very fast I love how well is designed and all the features it comes with It seems like I discovere a new feature everyday One of my favorite features is camera oh lord takes best picture and video quality And when using media apps very easy to upload fotos or videos and the quality its just amazing I recently purchased the Gear 2 watch and the VR headset Couldnt be happier with my Samsung products samsung is by far the best on the market We needed to get new phones and we love them Anm awesome device Great graphics fast and oh a great phone Great memory i like everything about the phone I recently purchased it My galaxy was a great choice my s5 galaxy was stolen at work which forced me to have to get a new phone and upgrade early and I couldnt be more pleased with my decision to go with an s7 Longer battery bloke better quality in pics more storage faster Internet just all around a better phone Id defitnley recommend Ive just had my phone for about two weeks but really like it  The battery stays charged most of day in use where my old phone died very quickly  The transition was pretty easy Latest and greatest  New phone u Its one of the finest handsets ever available in market though bit expensive its worth for the price The features are more enhanced but for samsung users they are basically the same as other samsung apps it has heath features and music features you can access and you do not have to worry about phone when you are in a rain storm I like the phone alot and it has a sleek sharp look to it 
Its takes a great picture and the processor speed is 
very attractive This is by far the best phone Ive ever had SHealth works better than on the S5 great screen quality HD camera is spectacular Expandable memory so you dont have to feel bad about taking too many cat photos Great updates to multitasking Speaker is GREAT for both music and phone calls I can go 2 days with average use and not have to charge

Overall very great phone The edge screen takes some getting used to but once I purchased a case it made it easier I like this phone and its features I am learning something new every day Im a huge fan of Motorola Droid phones let me get that outta the way Yet this being my first Samsung device of any kind Im somewhat impressed What drew me to a Samsung phone was the style of the phone and functionality of the camera also the VR promotion Most Droid phones arent all that sleek and shiny Yes they have leather and carbon fiber backs and they can be customized a little but there is too much going on A Samsung phone is very simple and simple is sometimes best Now I didnt check on the camera quality of the newest Droid on the market but this S7S cameras video capabilities at 60FPS looks mighty nice I must admit Last but not least the virtual reality headset promotion really helped to draw me in Now Ive ordered the headset but it hasnt arrived yet  its only been a couple of days since I sent in the order  but Im really hoping its going to be all that its cracked up to be I kinda checked it out in the store but someone had just used it and I was told it was in a  cool down mode  I believe I was told so I let it sit Ive just had it for a few day but am already comfortable with it This phone has great features like the apps edge and I like the design of the phone along with color The camera and video is good quality as well I love my new phone  Its easy to use and the features are amazing Love it very good phone I bought this phone approximately 7 days ago  This has not been an easy transition from a Note 2 to a Galaxy 7  There was not instruction booklet include to help me understand the phone  The keys on the keypad is too small for me to type on I havent found a big difference between the Galaxy S6 and this S7 I do hope theverything waterproof feature is as accurate as advertised  Its a very nice phone and easy to use  I wish the camera was as nice as other newer phones Loved my S5 love my S7 no Edge
Only buy odd  Galaxies it would seem Better than my S5 by far I love it  Great features Size just right Great job I really like the quality of the photos and the edge is awesome feature the phone seems durable and battery life isnt bad ether i would recommend this to everyone The S7 is user friendly has some very handy tools and was an easy transition from the HTC One M8 The Styling of the phone is fantastic I like the edge around the phone itself the performance is superb I am still trying to find a cover to protect it However that being said it is far better than the S6 that I had before I highly recommend it This phone is exerting the galaxy s6 edge should have been The build quality and and construction are top notch Common sense features such as expandable memory have returned The other most distinguishing feature that deserves praise is the otherworldly battery life This phone truly makes an effort to improve upon the previous models I switched from an iPhone and this is the first time Ive had an android based phone in years 

Contrary to what Ive seen in the old androids the OS is smooth and functional The phone is great Very fast and the split screen function is great for a business phone Size is perfect for pockets and still being able to view emails I also like the fact that its water and dust resistant so youre not shelling out a bunch more money for a water and or dust proof case and instead just one that idiot proofs your phone for when you drop it I owned the Galaxy S5 which was a great phone but the usb cord connection was a pain Im so glad it was changed back Samsung has always been my favorite for electronics and the S7 Edge is definitely their best phone yet It is BY FAR the most incredible phone that Ive had and Ive had a bunch Not trying to sound like a commercial or anything but that smooth edge curve is awesome The clarity of the screen is superb Watching videos on it is a treat unlike others that were a chore Im not a big camera guy but that virtual shot mode is nothing short of brilliant I show it to everyone that I can find that owns an iPhone and I can feel the hate oozing from them But seriously the Galaxy 7 edge is truly and incredible phone and a wonderful piece of art I was fortunate enough to be upgraded for free to the galaxy s7 edge I previously had the galaxy s6 edge which I absolutely loved but I dropped it and there goes my gold phone Nonetheless the s7 is performing better than I expect and the screen is lovely Im really using this phone to no limits It is wonderful to a point I have no regrets I just miss the gold in which they did not have in stocked  Overall an outstanding phone to have I was a little reluctant to buy a phone without a removable battery but my wife convinced me that we should upgrade from our Galaxy S4s This is an amazing phone and without peer It will be a good investment for probably 34 years of solid use

Things weve been wowed by include the camera the speakers quality the microphones quality the screen brightness and colors and the thinness and monocoque feel of the phone It is simply a beautiful piece of engineering

The only thing I want to have back is my recently contacted phone numbers in the dialer underneath my favorite contacts

Thank you Samsung for another great device and a surefire iPhone killer Screen is beautiful and the interface is very intuitive The Camera is amazing takes great lowlight pictures and has other fun features too such as panorama and 3d photos which are fun to play with I am just starting to play around with the other features of the phone to use it to its best potential But the lowlight camera is awesome

Big drawback though is the battery life Though I am overall impressed with everything else the battery gets used up in less than 24 hours and is a big ding against the performance This phone Is sleek slim easy to use takes beautiful pictures and the quality of the phone is amazing Works per specification I like most things about this phone I am happy about my selection and will hold on to it as long as I can This was an upgrade from my S4 I love the larger size faster speed and that its waterproof I have the gold one and notice that it does get a little warm during extended periods of use Not sure if its because of the metal vs plastic or not but still love this phone Ive had my S7 just over a week and couldnt be happier with it  I upgraded from an HTC One M8 which was a great phone all its own for some time  But after experiencing excessive lagging random freezes and app hangs and degradation of the touch screen from normal wear and tear over the past 18 mos I decided to upgrade  After much research both online and in talking to friends and coworkers whod recently purchased new phones both Android and Apple I decided on the Galaxy S7  The screen is bold and bright it handles every app Ive loaded with nary a hiccup its compatible with my existing chargers and cords and the wireless charging is a great feature  Oh and it also survived TWO unplanned and unintended drops onto pavement prior to purchasing a protective case for it   The core processor of this phone works like a beauty I dont think I have not been more satisfied until I got this phone on my own line The battery life is great but I miss the single step copypaste and the setting in the camera that allowed photos by pressing anywhere on the screen  The new cut and paste requires you to do a screen shot and then paste it  In the past all you did is select copy and then put it wherever you want  Not game changers but definitely wish programmers would stop changing things that work If I had known there were going to be so many problems syncing with my Gear I wouldnt have purchased the upgrade I like the new emoticons Love this phone Very intuitive long battery life awesome display great pictures Took a little time to get used to the cameras Super fast Excelent bought excelent perfomance I had the s5 before my s7 the phone is ok with a few more features then before I was used to the bigger screen on my s5 I like that it fits in one hand but i might have to bring it back for the note 5 for the bigger screen Ive had it for two weeks and still getting accustomed to it I went from a galaxy to an iPhone and didnt like it I traded my son for the upgrade so I could go back to samsung This phone does every thing that I was looking for and better The clarity of voice is so much better than my last phone the battery life is improved Pro Fast and great for vr
Con have to charge everyday if on it alot Best phone in the market Fast easy to use and powerful The big screen is also great for movies on the go I really like this phone it has a lot of cool features some which I havent even learned yet I am completely impressed with my new phoneit has amazing features especially the camera The resolution is great and the low light feature is a plus as well The split screen ability is very useful it allows u to multitask and do different things on the same screenAlso the screen shot feature is nice tooI could go on and on about how much Im loving my new phone I was also pleased with my instore purchase processeverything went smoothThank u Samsung for this great piece of technologyIm out I went from a S4 to the S7 Took a bit of customization but now its just as awesome if not awesomer than my S4 I doubt I will get another brand of phone Samsung does it right The customization options make its usability perfect for me Ok  Here it is Android continues to make huge improvement in their operating system every update Sadly  my previous phone never received updates and then the carrier dropped the product all together If you are a tech guy or girl and want to spend hours comparing specs on all the current phones out there sifting through reviews searching websites holding the phone in your hand asking around Dont waist your time take advice from people like myself who already did all of this and get this phone already Yes there is one other competitor on the market right now ie camera operating system features blah blah blah bandwagon blah blah This phone has morewhere it counts water resistants f 16 camera with dual pixels your expandable memory up to 200gb WHAT Shall I go on and say more nah Just do your self a favor and purchase this amazing phone Recently left an iPhone for the new Samsung and no regrets This phone is way easier to use than the iPhones sometimes cluttered interface The style is great plus it feels like it was designed specifically for my hand Paired with the Gear S2 the Samsung really out shines all competition We bought our phones a week ago and have enjoyed the great features of the S7 The addition of a flashlight was great  We are especially happy about the waterproof feature We have noticed that the sound is much better the pictures are clearer and the screen bright and easy to see  It was a smooth transition from the S5 I love how study my phone feels Ive had it 3 months and I love the size and thinness of the phone I wish the battery lasted longer it doesnt seem to like when I play games The phone has gotten incredibly hot on many occasions It is loud New s7 on fathers day This phone is great It looks gorgeous from the dual curved sides to the glass back The edge panels are as fun as they are informative and useful and the always on display is a nice addition The battery is decent Overall you definitely get your moneys worth I was disappointed that watching the help videos and getting an operating system update used up my data So Ive had the Galaxy S7 for a couple weeks now and couldnt be happier   I was quite happy with my S5 and it still works and looks great after 2 years but got a deal that was too good to pass up

Glad I did  The speed of this phone is wonderful and the camera improvements are what I needed When it comes to mobile devices I have used most of them I love everything about them How they make life more organized yet can be a huge waste of time if you find the right game 

I had been switching between the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6s Plus Until I purchased this Samsung Galaxy S7 I am not a monster nor have XL Hands One hand operations of the Note 5 and the iPhone 6s Plus were always scary I do alot of fishing from a boat and never felt like I had a good grip on either phone while having the pole in my other hand

The size of the S7 is perfect for someone that is very active its an easy fit in pockets of any shortsjeans without having 1 sticking out or the possibility to bend over without bending or breaking the phone

I could go back to using the larger devices but I truely have found the perfect companion in a mobile device

Form and Function done very well Easy to use  the battery life is amazing i just got this phone a week ago i really like the camera phone runs great still getting used to some of the features Crystal clear display of images screensand audio Very satisfied with battery life Not quite as satisfied with user interface Navigation thru screens takes too many clicks This phone can easily rival any iPhone Ease of use and features are second to none I have always loved the Samsung Galaxy phones They have out done themselves again Great phone The S7 is great Looking forward to what they come up with next Lots of ads and pop ups settings constantly getting changed I cant download or install some applications  Not too happy This product has great features and extravagant I will recommend it to people that are out looking for new devices I am glad it was introduced to me by the Verizon representative But a little expensive there are phone with the price cut in half with 6 gb of ram but you pay for almost perfection i guess This phone is really awesome and can stay charged for 12 hours straight The resolution is awesome I really like watching movies on it  It looks like your looking through a window it proforms awesome as well  I fell in love with this phone Its fun  and easy The s7 edge is one of my favorite phones  the finish on is really awesome and the proformance is a lot better  The battery life is one of my favorite features the battery allows you to use it for 12 hours without losing a charge  Like the features but accessibility is a pain from the front screen This is my first smart phone and so far I have only had to ask my kids a couple of questions So far it is easy to use and i like it I upgraded from a flip phone and wish I had never done so this phone drops more calls and the sound volume is so low I can barely hear it Making a phone call and texting is such a pain I avoid it when possible My old phone was a 2 button push from talkign to someone this one is a menu search and jungle of buttons to find anything This phone is the best phone Ive ever owned Its packed with features easy to use and the camera is top of the line Great phone This phone brings a lot of power and pairs well with my other Samsung products The Galaxy S7 is my 4th or 5th Samsung phone and the just keep getting better The first time I used the camera I was blown away Its better than most of the cameras I have owned When you enlarge a photo you lose no clarity zero It takes absolutely stunning pictures which you can edit in a variety of ways And the voice activated shutter is outstanding 

Voice texting is easier than ever because it rarely misses what I am saying 

I even convinced my daughter to switch to Samsung and she loved it

The best part is the charge port on the phone doesnt change with a Samsung Your old chargers may not be as fast but the can still be used if necessary Thank you Samsung for not being greedy like some other manufacturers

I recommend Samsung to anyone and everyone who looking for a new phone Keep up the good work There are many things I love about this new phone but the camera wow yall really upgraded it well The crisp photos the colors the special features that you added just wow From a person that loves taking photos and having the convenience of a good phone and a good camera combined thank you Fast charging advance technology water proof and sexy Exactly as advertised Exceptionally functional  Way too many features and some will add to you bill so be very careful Tons of apps fast all glass fast charging waterproofwhat Working group on learning features I bought this phone almost 2 weeks ago and already love it Tons of memory fast clear and awesome pictures Im in love with the camera quality and features
I also love the design This phone has so much stuff on it that is unnecessary and you cant get rid of it There are some things that are difficult to understand Blazing speed gorgeous design ergonomic body and absolutely stunning curved display made my heartrate go nuts I was waiting too long to upgrade from my previous Galaxy thinking its not a big step up and upgrade isnt worth it yet YES IT IS Payments waterproof and the lowlight camera are my deal breakers Im glad I finally made my choice 1 week in and Im in love   my new phone The phone is nicely designed and delivers all the features promised  I was disappointed to find that the InfraRed transmitter was dropped in this upgrade  How am I supposed to override my wifes TV channel selection  Im pretty sure the S6 still had the IR function Phone is OK  but it doesnt have phone a text message announcement  Miss that feature I had on my LG G2 phone The phone is GREAT but I still need to find all the special the special features hidden inside I love everything about this phone Dont know how I lived without it Most tasks were easier on my iPhone 5 I wish Id chose the IPhone6 latest model has somany featuresparticularly edge is 
the best
One of the best is screen which always

Very user friendly I have found the device to perform well with every task I have attempted This galaxy s7 has been  great so farh the speed  apps and everything the camer are all so much better I upgraded from a galaxy S4 which was a great phone my new S7 is even better than I thought it could be By far the very best phone Ive have ever owned samsung continues to improve on all their products and this is no different Love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Works better in every way than my old S3 Twice the phone is locked and does not recognize unlock pattern or fingerprint I am absolutely in love with my phone its quick the technology on it is awesome I am not very tech sabby but Im learning quick on it I enjoy the picture quality on the phone and the video is magnificent This phone has great graphics and a great battery life Its a huge upgrade Super excited the Verizon lady talked me into this Couldnt imagine not having ut So ithe may be because I havent had my phone very long But so far it seems just like the S5 I feel like its just the same just thinner the the S5 was I never liked that batteries are not interchangeable on certain phones since was disappointed to know I could not buy extra battery charging system this time around and now if my battery dies well ill have to wait till I can actually charge it again I do love the gold color I got for my phone I also felt it was a bit of a downgrade from the mega pixels of the S5 to the S7 the front is more but the back is less and well I use the back wayore and could care less about the front facing camera I know itll be a good phone that will last as Samsung has yet to let me down Hence almost all my electronics are indeed Samsung Problem with curge in screen it gets of way when youre trying to hold phone Improvement over S6 Brought back SD card and water resistance Still cannot replace battery and I did not want or need a glass back just something else to break rode my old galaxy sIII into the ground this s7 is tremendously more versatile faster holds a charge very well and is easy to set up and use Coming from a windows phone the Galaxy s7 Edge is a major improvement Apart from the sleek over edge design and super fast processing speed the s7 is also much more intuitively designed than the Lumia So far I am very satisfied with my new s7 edge with VR goggles I would recommend it to anyone Not only are the upgrades are fantastic but I find myself not needing my camera due to the quality in the photos I take Features are super easy to use and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is looking for a too otch phone Search engines and accessibilities to obtain many items through play store that are FREE is an added bonus This phone is truly amazing If you make the switch from iPhone to Samsung you wont be disappointed The design is very nice and features good The battery life is excellent 110 Ill give this phone a 10 Switched from iPhone just because I was bored and I was not disappointed I enjoy the customizability as well as so many other features I love the camera and the screen is a joy to use I purchased this phone 1 week ago because I was going on a vacation I was needing something to keep me entertained on the long plane ride and something to take photos and videos with My older HTC was having issues charging and holding charge The particular store I stopped into didnt have the HTC 10 in stock so I opted to get the Samsung S7 

It took a few days to get used to the switch from HTC to Samsung but I ended up liking a lot of the features on the S7 the fingerprint scanner the clarity of voice calls the screen clarity 

A few days after my S7 purchase I arrived at my vacation destination I stayed entertained by listening to about 5 hours of podcasts I had downloaded and I remember being impressed at how little battery life I had used I attribute some of this to the S7 and some of this to the fact that I was running in airplane mode  

This part is where Im really frustrated One day after I reach my destination the charging port on my S7 quit working I couldnt take photos of anything  I was also stuck for a very long boring flight back to the US  The whole reason I bought a new phone was because my older phone wasnt charging and I wanted something to use to take photos and keep me entertained on this vacation  The S7 is failing me here and I havent even had it for a week yet  This was a really special family vacation for me We were celebrating an immediate relative recently receiving his masters degree and his recent marriage We also had a terminally ill immediate relative come along with us with the likelihood that this will be his last vacation like this and our last vacation as our complete family I came away from this vacation with only about 4 photos  Because of this I will always be bitter about this S7 purchase

And to make matters worse while I had it plugged in hoping it would charge I dropped it off of my nightstand  The screen ended up cracking despite the fact I had purchased the UAG brand protective case to prevent this exact type of thing from happening so Im obviously also questioning the durabilty of this phone Since the screen is cracked Ill have to use an insurance claim and pay the deductible in order to have it replaced 

I am extremely aggravated with this whole purchase In hindsight I wish I wouldve picked any other phone except this one I have been using it the S7 a few months and NO problems like my old Samsung S5 that was ALWAYS out of internal space  The camera takes amazing pictures Be sure to get a case as it is very slippery without one  I use the tech21 as it is very slim Good phone if everyone else had it but apple is what they want Was so frustrated with last phone because of life of batteries on daily usage or no usage was glad I got to the point of making the change Ive had an excellent experience with this phone The screen is big without the phone being massive because of the design of the screen The phone is very fast and responsive to every thing that I do when it comes to day to day usage And lastly the sound quality is great when watching anything on the phone Very good phone Love the sleek design and android op system I have yet to tap its full potential I switched from iPhone 5s to galaxy S7 and it was the greatest thing in the world The Galaxy S7 has everything I ever wanted in a phone Great value Works much better than my previous phone Still learning phone but very happy with it so far Used iPhone for many years and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge hands down better phone in my opinion Cost high but got free Gear VR with phone and amazing I cant download anything from my galaxy to my computer for review and dublication The battery dyes  fast I am very satisfied with the new Samsung 7
As i was with my previous 5
Love the new features design
Definitely I would recommend this phone to all of my friends and people that are considering buying a new phone
I am a fan of Samsung products not one of the devises or utilities i own ever failed to operate as they were meant to
On this phone since i only own it for a month i have no doubt it will keep working as it should as well
Thx keep up the good work No problems with the phone I love it Beautiful picture  Easy to use This is a great phone I love it way better than the iPhone that switch from Very customizable and has a lot more features and I love the Samsung pay This phone is the best Great features design  I give The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge a 5 star review the design of the phone is amazing compared to the last phone that I had gs4 active their version of android has improved from the one they have in the gs4 active but they still have the same problem which is useless apps both by them and Att my service provider I bought this to replace my apple 5s phone as it got wet and the new feature of being able to spill on this phone and it will keep working intrigued me Amazing engineering Better than an iphone Its a samsung Cameras are superb and did I mention its waterproof What will they do next I have had this phone for about two weeks upgrading from a Samsung 5s  The new phone operating system is more user friendly the screen is very sharp with vivid colors the phone junction itself is great with more volume and clearer tones  The only issue that I find is the battery life  It is better than the 5s but in my opinion still not good enough  But for that I would give this phone 5 stars I love my phone I leaning new great features every day The phone is user friendly and a tons of apps Battery last a lot longer than S6 tons of improvements love this phone Loved my S4 and the S7 is even better  Nice computer I am really impressed with the power and speed of this phone Nice to have a Gear VR with it too The screen and design are gorgeous Very happy with my device Very happy with the speed and versatility I love the features and functions The Thing I Love About This Phone Is That I Can Go In And Out Of Apps Veryou Easily The Phone Doesnt Take Long To Restarting The Other Apps That Are In the Background Not Just That But The Finger Manuevering Is Exeptional just upgraded from S6 to S7 a week ago I have had my new phone for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it Love all of the different features this phone has Amazing functionality Pretty simple to understand Very easy to use Like that is is slim and easily able to slide into a pocket The phone has great apps already installed that I use all the time honestly will probably return it and wait on the next Note I had an iPhone and the transition to the Samsung was pretty easy I enjoy using Google play My only complaint is that I cant turn off data usage for individual  apps I like the low light camera phones feel good in your hand like its supposed to be there I like all the new function I liked my S5 but was ready to move up  What a good decision  The S7 is even sleeker and the speed and features are even better  Anxious to try the wireless charging Bought this phone about 2 weeks ago Decided to try the Samsung S7 due to the camera Quality of the camera is great However the phone continously kicks me off of certain sites such as Facebook and games I eventually get so frusterated of having to reopen my apps that I just give up I enjoy the phone but battery life is still an issue for Samsungs Works much better than my S3 Like the new features Phone is awesome Cell phone network is great During the switch it took awhile but the rep was friendly and helpful This S7 is the first Smartphone that Ive ever owned  My wife children and friends have been harping on me for years to get rid of my Samsung Intensity II and get a Smartphone but Ive resisted at every urging  My children finally forced my hand and I ended up with this S7 for Fathers Day  Thanks kids  Honesty the phone has great sound quality and the features seem to be without end  Battery life is a little less than the old Dumbphone but I still get at least 24 hours if I use it often I like the looks of the phone easy to usegood features light wt big enough to read best customer service they even send me the user manual Thank you very happy with the new phone So far my husband is very happy with his phone Samsung Galaxy 7 I had put in my brother pool and nothing happen to the phone Fast speeds I went and got my daughter one three days later Now my son and future son in law are next Its only been a couple of weeks but I carry it with me every waking hour Ive had the iPhone for 10 years now and decided to change things upIM SO HAPPY I DID This phone takes PHENOMAL PICTURES I took the babies to the local swimming pool and everyone was like omg you have your phone in the water lol while I wouldnt ever submerge it I know it says it can but I dont feel comfortable doing it I had no problem taken pictures of the little ones coming down those slides has been very easy to use easy transition from one Samsung to the next Its not too biggreat size Four days with this phone and I couldnt be more displeased  I use the phone to make calls text and as an alarm  I cant believe how hot it gets and how quickly the battery dies  I asked my daughter to grab my phone off the table and it was too hot for her to touch  Thats unacceptable That said Im not happy at all with this purchase and Ill be in the store once again to get it taken care of I purchased the S7 Edge about two weeks ago and love the clarity and vibrancy of the pictures and graphics Had the phone for a couple of weeks now and it works great It operates quickly and does not freeze when multi tasking This is an awesome phone Perfect size with a big screen I wasnt sure about the edge but I am super happy with it Fast takes great pictures great design easy to hold The software is intuitive and easy to get around Charges fast and the battery lasts a long time far longer than other phones Ive had Best phone Ive had and I dont really have anything bad to say about it except no ones makes glass screen protectors for it but thats not a Samsung thing I do not like this phone because it isnt as easy to operate as my HTC Example when copying text in a text message it doesnt allow you to select the text you want to copy its either all or nothing this is very annoying when someone tries to send you an address with more text than just the address in the text box then when you go to copy it in google maps you have everything they said along with the address This is not easy This has a great design awesome design and lightning fast I am so happy I chose to stay with Samsung I love the new features the Galaxy S7 has to offer The battery lasts longer The camera is clearer and the apps that are offered are great I dont think I will ever go back to an iPhone Great phone Will always by Samsung Love this plan so far I hoped that the battery would last longer on this phone but it hasnt done so Love it like it too much Phone calls not as good as Motorola People I call or who call me say the sound quality is terrible Volume could be louder Some dropped calls I bought this a month ago and everything about the phone is excellent I like the new improved Camera takes excellent pictures in low light areas Wanted to update to new phone went from s5 to s7 skipped the s6 because s7 had the SD card slot I waited till my son got his to see how he liked it  I asked him not long after and he was happy with his so I bought mine Not as good as the note I bought this phone a month ago and I am still trying to get it back to my preferred settings like my old S5  Now wish I never upgraded to the new phone  For what I use it for there is no need for the upgraded features and hassle of fixing everything Graduated from S4 to a S7 Edge very happy with the phone Ive dropped a couple of times not used to the bigger size minor crack in corner Most often comment I get from others is about the photos it takes Snapdragon processor performance is really good and battery life good Overall very happy with it Although I hadnt planned to buy a new phone I do like it I am not in any way a photographer but the phone on this galaxy s7 is beyond awesome and makes me want to take pics of everything  I also love the fact the phone is ip68 water resistant Sometimes I get a call and its raining Well no need to worry just wipe off the water and keep going The display is fantastic Crisp clear Settings allow you to make it your own Very few draw backs A little hard to see in bright sunlight Sound is brought through one small speaker making it a little spacey sounding However the headphones in the package with phone were unreal Very nice to listen through I really like the fast charging as well From 30 to full charge 1 hour and 15 minutes Sweet i upgraded from the s5 and i thought that was a great phone samsung has really stepped up their game and the amount of space i have is amazing not to mention the expandable memory i highly recomend the s7 to anyone looking to purchase a new phone samsung has great quality and features Last year I changed my smartphone and I chose Galaxy S6 edge It was so great When I saw the features of S7 edge I fell in love with it I think I made a good decision when I got it Other than the quality samsung phones this phone is tough I work in a very rough trade and my phone is subject to many elements that have ruined other phones I have not yet subjected this one to all of them yet however if it continues to preform as it is now then I have no doubt it will pass with flying colors Im a power lineman in alaska I am loving this phone It is so easy to use and I am finding more things that is does each day that I wasnt aware it did I love the photos it takes and the effects that you can do with them Great phone I was a sucker and purchased a Windows phone last go around and the S7 is definitely better in every conceivable way Physically it has an overall smoother feel to it and it does have a sleek appearance Its kind of like when cars switched over from boxier shapes to more streamlined bodies Performance wise I have not had a single issue so far The home screen is not overwhelming visually like my previous phone and is very intuitive to manipulate and customize Obviously the app selection is far superior as well

The camera has a lower resolution than my previous phone but what it lacks in pixels it more than makes up for in functionality and performance As a science teacher I look forward to using the slow motion video feature

This by far is the best smart phone that I have ever owned There are so many great aspects about this phone that I love The motion features are some of my favorite  for example if I dont want to answer a call all I have to do is turn over my phone and it sends them straight to voicemail Or to take a screen shot I just slide my had across the screen I love love LOVE the new technology being utilized in this phone It does everything This phone is great It has what i need to do everyday tasks for business Love the phone  Easy to use Easy to read Great choice This is my 5 galaxy phone and the best yet The design and look are very nice and sharp The phone is very fast and responsive and the camera is amazing This is my first Android phone I am very impressed so far My wife and I have had our new phones for a few months now and love them I love the user friendly functions and clarity of the camera The one thing that Im in love with is the Samsung Pay This has has changed how i process my purchase transactions I have only had 2 locations not able I was not able to use this at My wife loves the customization abilities this phone has I do wish the battery lasted longer though but other that that a 95 I like this phone I previously had the Samsung Galaxy 4 This S7 has newer features but same overall layout My S4 lasted for years I hope this phone will be as durable I will say one of the biggest differences between the S4 and the S7 I noticed is the call quality is amazing When you talk to someone on the phone it sounds like they are in the room with you Just purchased an S7 and I love all the features speed and display Camera work great too The phone itself is a nice change from the Note series Its odd to have a smaller phone but its features make up for the decreased size Plus who doesnt want the ability to store and additional 200 gb of memory After reading review after review the Samsung Galaxy S7 came out on top I was actually looking for a better phone than my S5 but had to realize that leaving Samsung was foolish Reviews said the only thing against the S7 was bloatware which is a problem with the carrier not the phone Amazing that that is the only thing wrong with the phone The camera just clobbers the competition Why on earth why you would buy a camera with this camera Just updated to the 7 and Samsung again brings me good pics easy use and plenty of options Love the slimmer look and better grip of phone
Camera is great Best phone ive ever had super fast super clear camera is amazing no joke BUT it could be a bit tricky especially when you keep touching the buttons on the edges There are also some apps that you cant delete but are very annoying Otherwise brilliant job samsung Having been a long time Note 3 user I was sad to see it die but I knew from friends that the Note 5 was just not the same and I would not be happy with it So I checked out the Galaxy 7 line I am pleased to have the expandable memory back but the verdict is still out on not being able to access the battery For me the camera is the greatest selling point on this phone I take lots of pictures I just took pictures of a sunset ceremony and all of them are crystal clear I am also loving the feature of having the time displayed on the edge at night no need to turn on the phone and squint through bright light to see the time Only time will tell but so far it is turning out to be a good phone I do miss the S pen but I might be able to get over that I had an iPhone 5s before this phone it was a dream to get this phone I love the accessibility of android but still feels like an iPhone Very simple to use Amazing Easy to use but I dont like the autocorrect when I downloaded messenger from Facebook it changes my regular text messages and size Also people have a hard time hearing me on speaker Other than that its a good phone The best phone Ive ever owned and I had an iPhone 
This is by far the best I had the iPhone and I contually had to update it It was the worst and now that I have the Samsung edge 7 I no longer have to worry about that LOVE THIS PRODUCT THANK YOU SAMSUNG I upgraded from a S4 to the S7 It has all of the features and I know and love of the S4 with the performance of a modern phone with plenty of memory and storage The added functionality of the wireless charge is a plus but does not work with the thick Otterbox defender case Great camera and the fingerprint scanner is pretty accurate Pros  likes  Fast camera great battery life excellent  I like how you double click the start button to bring up the camera  Now if I can remember to do that when I need the camera quickly  I can go a whole day and have battery left over  That is a definite plus for me
Cons  I would like to see a feature on the camera to print the date and time of the photo Phone was a a complete 360 upgrade from my previous phone which was the Samsung Galaxy 5S Most of the keys and shortcuts were similar to continue the same concept but there are so many more things you can do to be efficient from your phone Example take screenshot on my phone then quickly and efficiently crop it  send it within seconds In addition to that battery lasts so much longer charging is not much of a pain and camera is so much better Plus its water proof This is how every smart phone should be Although coming from the very simplistic iPhone 5s I had a very hard timr adapting to all the features the Galaxy S7 has to offer I recently upgraded from another brand Id been a fan for years but I decided to try the Samsung S7 Im very pleased with my decision The photos are amazing I like the suite of Samsung apps that are installed on the phone There are some features on my previous phone that I really miss but this phone has enough for me to feel like Im not missing much Purchased the s7 on Tuesday 621 and by Wednesday evening purple spots began to take over the screen Called our new service provide att early on Wednesday to tell them that calls were not able to be made or received They tell me to come into the store to have it checked out they run test on it and take it in the back and come back with the phone working Yeahwell hours later Purple spots begin to appear on my phone Call att back on Thursday to notify them of the spots again Im told to come in so I do I get there and they tell me it is a hairline fracture and they can not do anything for it and insurance does not cover it They told me I must have pressed on the screen to hardtotally unacceptable since they have handled the phone more than me and who knows what they did to my phone when they took it in the back 

Whatever you dodo not use att as your provider they are WORTHLESS I have had success with Galaxys in the past so Im hoping this was just a bad experience caused by att Looks like Im heading back to Verizon Very fast device Good featuresnice to see some of the standard apps from my S4 have been removed for the S7 Only had the phone for a few weeks now but very pleased with it so far My previous phone died and I was forced to buy a new one I like the new keyboard set up I have owned several Samsung phones The all have given me great service and have been easy to set up and use Transferring my data and personal information from phone to phone has been simple and fast Great products Just changed from Blackberry Passport to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Theres no comparison since Passport isnt near supporting apps as Samsung does at all Edge screen  Samsung pay  ease of use functions  wireless charging  water proof are the main things that I lost the most On top of this I also purchased Samsung Gear 2  the smart watch It makes everything even easier Fully functional and is near replaceable for cell phone Great job Samsung After years of having an iPhone owning every model made I reached a point where it was time to move on

Ive tried samsung devices before and always went back to iPhone for one reason or another

The Galaxy S7 Edge has changed this mindset altogether

Hands down when it comes to features speed battery life and the number one selling point was the camera Bar none the best

I tested this theory with a friend We took the same exact shots at the same time and location

They are now switching to the Edge

In short Samsung by far edges out the iPhone by wide margins including design Great phone nice screen and so easy to use Good battery life The Samsung s7 compared to the note 4 in my opinion is no comparison I do miss the stylus that is in the note The camera is better on the S7 The S7 is smaller than the note 4 the performance is better I love the look of the S7 I recommend the S7 over the note at this point I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago  I absolutely love everything about it The phones great 
A few of the negatives 
Battery life isnt good
If your not tech smart could be difficult to figure out 
Seems I go through more data on this then my old phone 
The good 
Charges fast 
Camera is great
Super loud speaker 
The graphics and screen looks amazing 
Overall solid phone scale 1 to 10 give it a 8 Love it already I used to be an iPhone user but not anymore Love the camera clarity and color Im completely in love with the s7 phone the s6 edge to this is a great improvement Puchased the Edge for 1 week and expected more with new screen design Returned and exchanged for the Note5 which I like better with bigger screen and better camera 16mp vs 12mp Received this phone as a gift for my birthday  I love it It does sooooo much and I still am learning about all the things it does and I have had it for little over a month and a half Good features compared to Windows phone I would recommend greatest phone I have ever owned Has exceeded all my expectations for it and has renewed my faith in humanity Good thing to bring back the SD card almost lost me Fast beautiful the envy of my coworkers
The low light camera takes the most impressive pictures this feature has opened up so many opportunities for the best kind of personal photography My fav though would be the speed and responsiveness that when in hand gives me this S7 edgeness  sleek metal  futuristic  device  ex machina  universal tool  intelligent  NASA feeling of new world robotic awesomeness As you can tell I love this phone Ive had several samsungsthis one is greatScore I cant say enough about this phoneis love everything about it Ive had the 345 and now 7seriously you guys have outdone yourselves Ive had Galaxy phones since the S3 and Ive loved every one that Ive had and they keep getting better Im  enjoying my phone  greatly First of all I like to say that the water resistant feature is amazing as well as the expendable memory that was brought back by popular demand The camera is awesome and its just an overall amazing product I like the new s7 it really fits my life style Really I love this phone even with its draw backs mostly I gets hot which slows it down u have 2 let it cool off after a quick charge  in the summer with no AC after about 115hrs of Gear VR uses it tells me 2 let my phone cool off

Also its slippery  without a case it some times seems impossible 2 pick up So get a case This phone is really really great Love the edge features makes it so much easier to contact my people Great investment honestly While I think phones are progressing to the point of diminishing returns this phone is a huge upgrade in performance from my Samsung Galaxy S3 I tend to wait to upgrade so I am pleased with the performance jump while the cynic in me says it does everything my old phone used to do only faster This phone is a void upgrade what the galaxy s5 many new features I enjoy good screen excellent phone good phone Cracked screen cant be replaced very expensive repair I love this phone and the features it has and Im still discovering more features as I go along Ive only had one issue that was losing sound once I restarted my phone and everything is good again Keep in mind this issue is only with the gold models Great phone looks great cost was fair no problems with the fun I love the galaxy phones and the S7 is an awesome piece of equipment So far this phone is amazing I recently changed from an iPhone and its so much smoother and easier to use Love the size and the brightness of the screen It also has a lot of useful apps in it So far this has been an excellent phone Battery life is amazing The processing speed is great Tons of great small features It does have the att bloatwear that everyone hates but has come to expect so that isnt a giant issue 
My only real complaint is the edge design I dont know if it is my hand shape or size but i constantly hit things on the edge which wouldnt have happened with the standard s7 The camera is amazing The clarity is unbelievable for a cell phone The S7 Edge fits properly in my hand The cameras forward and rear are super sharp and the low light feature was unexpected and works far better than Id imagined it would Ive had competitor smart phones in the past and the S7 destroys them all from battery longevity to user interface responsiveness The processing power is great and split screen multitasking is now fast enough to be lucrative Im looking forward to more edge widgets Ive dropped it several times off my counter onto tile flooring and not a scratch The S7 Edge is the best phone Ive owned and I personally recommend trying one out if your in the market for a new phone With the spectacular features and great resolution this product can considered as the start of a new generation Wireless Charging Amazing Processor And so many other specs that seem impossible to get through I recommend this to anyone who wants a high tech phone at a reasonable price This galaxy s7 edge is awesome Great speed Great design Great camera Works way better than the S5 i had previously Highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their phone Love the way you can change the setting to bet suit my needs I like the Samsung S7 much better than my last smart phone But sometimes its a little confusing when I want to do a simple phone call Excellent product from a trustworthy company Love picture clarity speedy access to Web and apps Love my new phone I had a phone from a competitor and decided on the S7 Best move I ever made Love the phone Perfect size Love the metal chassis Great phone overall The battery is better and phone is much faster than s6edge Love this phone If anyone want to buy a smart phone S7edge definitely is the best choice love my phone I would be lost without it its easy to use and works anywhere I need it This is the best phone I have ever had I will never switch to another phone that is not a galaxy This phone is totally AWESOME I bought this phone for the extra speed and the better pixels Im more than satisfied Homerun for Samsung I love my new phone The pictures are clear and video is awesome The size of the phone is perfect I used to have Samsung phones but for a while they were not my favorites The last one I had a couple of years ago did not performed to my expectation the battery was not functioning properly it freezes etc etc Then I decided to switch to iPhone and had ben an iPhone owner for about 4 years Now I decided to have a second line and decided to give a new chance to Samsung It was a great decision My Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is a great buy a fantastic phone and easy to understand given the fact that I came from using an iPhone for a while and that I am still keeping my iPhone to use This new Galaxy S7 edge is great in design and features Love it Keep it up Samsung I really enjoyed this phone Everyone needs one The best mobile device Ive had so far Fast great screen durable and I just added a 200gb micro sd card to store all of my music Great battery life even when playing music and the active pixel time display is a great touch I would recommend this device to anyone looking for an all in one solution to mobile media and connectivity had to finally put down the Droid because of weak battery salesman was very helpful and showed me several phones Went with the Samsung Galaxy S7 very happy with new phone Technology and speed is amazing This is a great phone Attractive easy to use and fast with much better battery life than my previous Samsung phone Im a huge Samsung Galaxy fan and I upgraded to the S7 and love it The camera is fantastic the touch screen does not lag and the battery keeps going and going and going The graphics and processor speed are great making it easier and more enjoyable to watch videos and play games especially with the Gear VR Took a little long to setup  Had to restart phone three 3 times  Easy to use  Recommend you download the User Manuel like my new galaxy phone Have had the phone 23 weeks The screen the processor all the specs this is the ultimate phone device Love my Samsung The Edge is beautiful and so easy to use I used it for all of Internet needs as well as talking to friends the phone is great all around phone cameraaudio and display is very good Easy to get around in the phone and fast response I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 
So easy to use and the graphics are tight 
Pictures are beautiful and the durability is great
I also love the long battery life 
I recommend this phone to everyone I know great sound quality and speaker for calls battery life is more than expected camera  takes good pictures and video I recently upgraded to my Galaxy S7 and I love it Coming from the HTC ONE M8 you can really appreciate this phone My favorite part of it is the seamless integration between the phone and apps I have downloaded we had this phone for a little bit it was the new one to the one my wife had before Phone is amazing very easy to use and lots of amazing features The features added to this new model are great It shows that Samsung is looking to innovate for every model unlike the iphones that are pretty much the same for every single new model 

Waterproofing the phone is always great and should be on all top models of phones The VR ability of the phone is an awesome surprise along with a lot of the added mini features such as the ability to adjust the keyboard size This phone is the best perfect picture quality easy to hear everyone very accessible to use highly recommend Great phone with awesome features Way better than iPhone Easy to set up and start using Effortless transition from Samsung Galaxy S5 phone to the S7 Touch screen is so responsive Beautiful display so bright and clear The camera focuses fast and pics are sharp and clear I bought this phone as an update to a Samsung Note 3 It was outdated and I did not fully utilize its options I chose the edge because i believed the S7 was too small and this would ease the transition 
Did not have a great experience purchasing the phone as the data would not transfer correctly or completely causing a loss of a bunch of time I had the help of the staff and they were experienced and still baffled Upon my first few weeks of use i realized I do not really use the edge at all The curved glass is sensitive and would often open the screen when undesired And the screen would occasionally not open if a larger finger grazed the side as two points of input A bit inconvenient The technology was improved The simple regular used items like the contacts camera were a bit more involved and valuable
I noticed right away that everywhere I went I could not get more than 15 bars of connectivity where the older samsung got 5 This phone was always burning hot as well After reading about built in tech to prevent heating this concerned me I returned the phone for a replacement The data transfer was even more painfulwhy This newer phone is not as hot as often anymore but still gets hotter than my comfort zone and still too often Additionally it still does not get the full bars of connectivity even if it is wifi and you are standing next to the unit I think this is definitely a phone issue I love the look and feel I appreciate Samsung for more than just phones But at the cost I paid to purchase plus accessories I should not have any fears or discomforts from a HEAT or Connectivity issue Think if the S7 regular was a bit larger it would be the go to device without doubt 
A solid phone just concerned about the two issues The Galaxy Edge 7 is the Titan of all smartphones I love the sleek edge appeal and the water resistant comfortability I can feel sheek safe and confident that my phone can withstand the worst of the worst I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a likenoother phone I just got it about 3 weeks and I love it This phone was purchased to replace a Droid Razor Maxx  Which I had my old phone  Im returning the S7 Super fast and super handy although I wish they would bring back the Peel Remote and Snote I have had this phone for like 2 Weeks and I have noticed such a huge difference This phone has not only a nice design but the performance is great Their are so many things I can do with Samsung edge that I could not get from other phones I have owned I talked about the phone so much I got my coworker to buy one I put this phone up against anybody else I like my cell phone but Im frustrated trying to figure out basic functions or what I feel should be basic Switched from S4 to S7 Easiest phone switch ever Longest part of the switch was deleting info from old phone before my son inherited the S4 I just received it this past Tuesday it is easy to  navigate From the battery life to the camera this phone has exceeded my expectations I like everything about this phone and wouldnt choose any other product over it This phone 7edge is so much nicer to watch movies and photos on I had a Galaxy 5 before A little harder to get around Im 70 years old its a little more complex But Im glad I my the change I went in with my mind set on the Note5 but they were sold out at the time and had the option to wait I played with the Galaxy7 and when I found out it was waterproof I had to have it Its easy to use great display great camera etc I could go on and on It has been two weeks and wits a mophie charging case  the battery life last past a typical work day The camera is amazing and boy Im really glad I did The Galaxy S7 is about the same size as the Galaxy S5 so if youre used to the S5 youll be fine with a S7 The one main thing Ive noticed is that the flash is on the side of the camera on the back instead of under it  so if you have a problem with a finger always in the photovideo you take this should help alleviate that problem One issue I have with this phone is that it only comes in two colors  gold and black Wouldnt it be nice if they could have maybe done a silverblack and a goldblack Lets get some color going I love the features of this phone Having the ability to take a picture with the front facing camera just by holding up your palm is brilliant Also I really like the split screen feature for texting When the phone is turned sideways in the message app you can view your favorite contacts recent text histories and text a message to your selected contact The phones brightness level adjusts perfectly so that you can clearly read the screen no matter how bright it is outside the battery life is phenomenal I recently went on an 8 hour road trip and played games  pandora for at least 65 of the trip and by the time I reached my destination phone still had 26 battery life The sleek design of the phone is very appealing I have already recommended this phone to all of my friends 2 of which have already gone out and bought it I have owned 6 smart phones including an iPhone and this is my favorite So easy not one probkem Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it Nothing really wrong with this phone except the battery life is not that great The phone is very good and surprisingly unlike most phone actually last a long time most phone when your not even using would be dead by the end of the day but this phone the samsung galaxy s7 edge last me all day with or without using it and I have had this phone for almost 3 months now and havent had any problems besides the use of the snapchat app but that probably the app and not the phone so overall I like this phone and I actually feel like it going to last a long time unlike most phones Love the phone its edge screen adds a pop out look to everything speaker is crisp sound but not that bass feel as the s5 gave but I can live with because I still have my s5 The earpods were alright I feel some people will find then to produce to much of bass and a little ion the large side for the ears Camera is superb and touch screen is precise also the fact that I can change my theme is great not sure if u can do that on s6 and others before s7 I never owned those The price is a bit much but if your diehard fan and dont want to wait till price drops then by all means go purchase it I like this product over all for now Iv been using it only for a few days So far so good I have used Samsung phones for over 5 years now and I love them I just upgraded from the S5 to S7 and it was so easy to transfer everything They are long lasting and have great technology and software support I would definitely recommend this phone to someone who is shopping around Love the feel of the phone and how you maneuver it Upgraded from an S6 Edge to the S7 Edge Better size shape and performance Nice and comfy mobile phone I like it so much and easy to use Thank you for the technology that this phone has I am able to use it with ease and the performance is consistently excellent

Pictures are very clear This phone has everything I like about a smart phone It is dependable rugged and has a longer battery life than other phonesso far Very few issues as yet I love my S7 Edge its sleek and classy looking performs exceptionally well and I dropped it in a puddle the day I bought it and it didnt fry it I love the camera and the ease of viewing the screen even on a bright day with my sun glasses  Having trouble getting the text notifications to work on message I love this phone and its sleek design It works fast and customizable I love the camera The phone is easy to use and fast I like the size of the screen and the colors are very bright Since I have used Samsung cell phones since they came out I have enjoyed using them Each one is better then the previous phone I just got my S7 last week I really love it I just feel like I dont know very much about it yet Even with all the mallware that Verizon requires for this phone it is still very quick Great product love it everyday Surly recommend to friends Purchased phone June 17th had no issue with it Easy to use Switched from another very popular cell phone product I like the ability to customize phone The other company puts you in their box and they wont let you out Samsung Galaxy S7 is the greatest thing ever everything youve ever needed  wanted in a cell phoneand Ive had a mobilecell since the beginning of mobilescells Its my first samsung smart phone ND I just simply loved it great features best camera everI mean gonna buy for my wife tooND great gear vr This phone is the perfect package Everything works great Also the phone feels perfect and looks awesome Just keep making quick updates on the software side Super bright display crisp clear phone calls Fast Great phone overall Smooth processor great camera great features Only downfalls are these two things the battery life is not as expected it is worse I can barely get through a day at the same time though I am connected to the gear s2 via Bluetooth all day The other thing is that when playing music through Bluetooth headphones it is barely audible and you cant adjust the volume to hear it Overall great phone and would still recommend it to anyone Without installing a lot of apps its already pretty handy To jogging and swimming since its waterproof Lov all of its features and love my phone I bought the samsung galgalaxy s7 a few days ago and love it The battery life is fantastic and it runs so fast and smooth The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is a great product The edge features are honestly not the most useful but its there It looks amazing One of the best looking phones Overall amazing product I had a S5 before I got this s7 I like how fast and seamless the transitionsame are Once I got an update the battery life is amazing Im talking all day and getting to 40 by night time I havent yet messed with all of the features but I have played with the camera which is also great It has the pro mode and that is so fun
 If your trying to decide between this and another player with it I also got the IPhone 6 but so happy I got this The expandable memory alone is worth it I have had my S7 for a couple of weeks now and love everything about it Samsung just keeps getting better every year And thank you Verizon for having such great staff at your local store they made everything quick and easy Love camera Takes wonderful pi9 I upgraded fro S5 to S7 and with the help of Adan from Costco the account transition was easy to understand then the more I played with the phone I found it similar to the S5 but faster and with a better battery Those two features are very important to me I am in love with this phone it has everything easy to access This product has very nice display with its clear view HD screen Interactive screen is a big plus Doing multi screen open 2 apps at a time and one of my favorite is the screen saver photo in one off the widget Wow Great that you can put your favorite pictures in loop for viewing Its design being the edge goes a pros and cons Cool for the viewing and style but practicality its hard to text or shoot video without accidental touching the edge Can be solved by having a nice case to prevent that 
Waterproof is the main reason for Upgrading from ios to android Being in a rainy part of Alaska I can shoot video and take pictures without the worry of the Gear getting wet A big upgrade from a phone with a bulky waterproof case terrible audio because of it completely sealed to a real waterproof phone with great audio and worry free Love all the new features But soooo much bloatware on this ATT version And the set up features are more difficult to get to than on the S5 I had before The battery SO FAR is outstanding and much much much better than the S5 The camera is much better than the S5
Great phone but really costs more than it should I had a blackberry for years and was going to get an iPhone because I use anow iPad at home and was used to the iOs until I tried the Samsung Galaxy edge s7 I only had the phone for 4 days and accidentally dropped it  The screen shattered Instantly Had my S4 for 2 years and never had a problem with it after it was dropped Would not buy this phone again if given the choice As for the rest of the questions I didnt have the phone long enough to understand the new accessories It is a great phone Light weight and very fast I would recommend it to anyone This is my first samsung phone since my very old flip phone I had two LG phones in the mix and this is hand down the best phone I have ever had Very fast accurate and above all so easy to use So many awesome features And I havent seen someone do something that I cant do yet  Love it This product is great and easy to use for 55 age This is an amazing phone It feels great in the hand and works great I switched from an iphone 6 plus and i like a lot better Much faster than my s6 and expandable memory is back I just bought this phone a few days ago and I love it Its super easy to use and has some great features such as the fingerprint recognition The camera is outstanding You can get some great shots especially if you use the pro mode on it Ive always loved my samsung Galaxies Ive had every version aside from the actives and edges I was a little disappointed that they didnt have the S7 in white which is what I always go for but thats completely overshadowed by how great this phone is Im always impressed at how much fasterclearer each version is and theyre so easy to set up exactly how I like them

The S7 is the most recent in a long line of my favorite devices And it was 100 cheaper than the S6 crazy Got this phone 3 weeks ago and its everything I wanted in a phone Ive had this new version a week now and its as good and better than my S5 I had a Galaxy 4 Mini  loved it  The S7 is even better Got this phone a week ago and do far its been ok my biggest problem is that I cant seem to put a message tone to my text messages  But still figuring out the phone completely The phone is great Same as the S5 i replace except for the brighter screen and more onboard memory Unfortunately I wake up one week later and now I have a line running down the side of my screen Not good Heading back to the store tonight The phone gets 5 Stars My wife loves this phone
My wife is not tech savvy she said this was the easiest to learn phone she has ever had Good battery life and storage I just switched over to the galaxy s7 from an iPhone and I am loving it I feel so far behind on the newest technologies This phone can do so much more than my other phone I am so pleased looking forward to finding out what more it can do I have had Samsung galaxy phones since the first S Without a doubt this is the best one ever Ive had this for 2 months now and so far the Galaxy 7 32 GB Gold is by far the best phone Ive ever had Just upgraded to the S7 from an S5 What a difference Better battery life Faster Great camera Phone audio is fantastic very pleased with the phone and Verizon This phone is pretty much the phone of all phones The design is flawless the performance is untouchable the camera is just plain out amazing A couple of years ago I switched over to an iphone just to see what was the fuss and hype Needless to say I hated that phone A lot It felt cheap I wanted to go back to an android based phone ever since When I read up on the Galaxy S7 I was sold But the second I held it in my hands is when I felt I was reUnited with a long lost love This phone is BEYOND AMAZING The Galaxy S7 is essentially the best phone available today The simple fact of it being water resistant is a major factor in my purchase being a machinist my device is subjected to a wet dirty or greasy environment almost daily not to mention the fact it has a camera with a better picture than i ever thought possible it honestly takes better pictures than any portable digital camera Ive ever had The user interface is seamless  pleasant to use  theres tons of features that make this device the perfect smartphone for me  Im still discovering new things Im unaware of almost daily The only complaint i have thus far is that my old S4 Active had the built in tv remote  i was very surprised the S7 does not as i used that feature daily but otherwise I love it The phone is amazing I love the color  the design The curved edges of the phone makes everything really vibrant I enjoy the video calls feature because its not grainy I can actually see  hear the person clearly One thing I really love about this phone is that it is user friendly I used to have an iPhone  it was a bit complicated but everything is straightforward Im always finding a new feature  playing around with this phone Thank you Samsung 1010 This is my best phone purchase yet It looks great It has many features that my other phones didnt have I havent explored everything that it has to offer yet but what I have is great I still think Samsung makes good products however I do not recommend this phone This phone or maybe I should say the operating system with this phone just has too many problems to list Ive had to different galaxy S7s and so has my husband each one with missing apps It locks up things shut down on you some things dont work the way theyre supposed to Ever since I have this phone













 I just want to smash it Just my opinion I knew I made the right choice when I walked out of the shop into the blazing bright sunshine wearing my sunglasses carrying my new Galaxy7 in hand and could clearly read its screen 
Id been torn between moving to this Galaxy S7 or sticking with a different brand and upgrading to the newer model Most important to me is clear call receptionconsistent connection which just wasnt happening with my old one so I made the switch to go with Samsung based on personally observing Galaxy users with the same service provider I have receiving clear calls in locations where my smart phone failed 
I am new to the features and performance of this Galaxy S7 as far as I can tell they are good I love the design compared to other smart phone options The display and the dimensionsweight processor 12MP camera rate an excellent value is above average in relation with the smartphone market in my opinion This phone is perfect for selfies and making videos I am still learning about the phone But it seems better than my S6
The battery life is much improved I think this is the best phone yet to date Although I dont need them I think the accessability features are off the hook Kudos Samsung I love my 7 edge I always have had Samsung products they are great The s7 edge is by far the best I love the camera and how it adjusts to low light My edge features are all set up and it is so quick and easy to use my apps Just a swipe of the finger
I am still learning about everything it will do I definitely think with the features it has it was worth it for me to pay the extra money Its such a great phone I couldnt be happier with my choice I didnt intend to get a new phone but my previous phone was having problems I had my eye on the Samsung Galaxy S7 so I decided enough already I was due for an upgrade anyway I already appreciate the design of the phone and I appreciate the design and the screen being bigger than the average phone Plus its easy to figure out and the display quality is brilliant However its really a bit too big which makes carrying it around in my pocket a nuisance Otherwise its a great device and Im having a lot of fun with it I couldnt be happier with my s7 edge I switched from a note edge to a 7 edge on 610 and I love everything about it Switching to a Samsung a year ago was the best Getting this phone made it better I upgraded from the S4 to the S7 and I just love all the new features and the sleek design I just got this phone but it is good so far Dont have much to say This phone is great I love the Camara And is much faster then its older mates My first edge phone and I absolutely love it Love the auto filing makes everything oh so easy to maneuver around Love all upgraded features What more can I say I just Love this phone Desmond Sexton is a good friend of mine and I always go to him with questions about my phone or when searching for new phones When k came to him in search of a new phone he suggested the galaxy s7 and 3 others He took his time to assist me and answer all my silly questions And we settledont one the s7 And boy was he right  I have found that the Samsung Galaxy s7 is one of the best phones i have ever owned The overall performance of the phone is amazing The high end display is amazing and the waterproof build is quality made Just love the designwaterproof is plus Battery is good so far Very happy with this new device Fast and responsive Sad that it is not as big as my old Samsung but its my fault for not checking size when I bought it online Its a little hard to find the widgets section but thats more of an Android thing than a Samsung thing It does seem to have some problems with GPSLocation services I havent figured out why it thinks GPS is off even when I have it turned on in settings Charges MUCH quicker than my old phone Love the new features the phone offers from the previous generations This phone is pretty cool From the captivating edges of the screen to the 3D oculus headset this phone is swiftly winning my heart Coming from an IPhone I was a bit hesitant to jump ship but I think Ill be pleased with this This is by far the best battery life I have gotten out of a brand new android phone ever I am honestly amazed The builtin wireless charging is also ridiculously convenient and works well even through an Otterbox case The Samsung UI is of course beautiful even better than it was on the S5 which I fell in love with very quickly after having had HTC and Motorola phones The bluetooth functionality is just smarter than any other phone remembering devices that I only wanted to play media when I also have a headset connected but dont know whether to credit that to Samsung or Android to be honest The size is good it is not a small phone by any means but also doesnt feel like I am carrying around a tablet all the time like some other phones on the market right now Touch sensitivity is perfect the auto brightness feature is lightyears beyond anything else I have had Most satisfying upgrade yet Its almost too nice Im worried that Im not really allowed to have something this nice Best phone I have ever had would recommend every body get one Im sure some people like the Edge features but for me its a negative Too frequently the Edge screen caused me to accidentally launch or close applications Great phone super responsive and easy to transition too from s4 I been a Samsung user for the past 5 years Its easier to manage and understand I like to download free music I bought the Samsung Edge instead of the iPhone to replace my 5 year old iPhone because I wanted a better camera bigger screen and a promotional virtual reality headset  It has all I hoped for but the transition has been a little more difficult than I thought  After owning it for a week I feel like Im finally getting the hang of it  I do NOT like the split screen option because it keeps popping up when I dont want it But it is slightly bigger than my old phone which I like and its faster and easy to use once you get used to the difference from an iPhone I  this phone This is my first Android phone I have previously owned the A phones The Galaxy S7 is awesome and easy to use I am really enjoying it The phone runs smoothly The battery lasts very long much better than any of my previous phones I keep discovering new features Edge is the right one to use and awesome it is so great and I will recommend to my people
design and function what else do you want to say nothing but Samsung galaxy 7 edge Upgradable memory is a must and Im glad its back Wish the battery was removable but surely theres a good reason The phone runs smooth and gear vratio is astonishing Cant wait to get thegear360 The only problem is the tempered glass not fitting the screen Edge is the right one to use and awesome it is so great and I will recommend to my people
design and function what else do you want to say nothing but Samsung galaxy 7 edge I wait for the new Galaxy every year Does everything I need it too When my iPhone 6 died logic board I decided I had more than enough with Apples arrogance and bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 While there are a couple minor issues no audio mute button on the side contacts in phone app wont allow for last name listings for sorting seriously Im pleased with it I love the wireless fast charging and even though it hasnt happened yet Im sure the waterproof feature will be useful Loving my s7great phone The screen is beautiful and the simplicity of the functions I love I went for note 3 to this phone Love it Im still figuring out things in sure Im not using to full convenience for me Soon very soon Great phone  love the speed  love the featuresthe only thing that I wish was that the battery lasted a bit longer I love the design of the phone and I love how it runs its thinner than most smart phones which makes it feel very light in my hand Iam disappointed that I cant change the color in the text bubbles for the sms stock app for the phone I hope that will be included in an update soon and maybe they will add some kind of feature to add a display name for contacts so you can have a nickname display instead of the name of the contact Anyway thats features Im hoping will be added to the android upgrades at some point but as of right now Iam very satisfied with the phone and like it a lot more than HTC because of how smooth the software runs on the samsung galaxy s7 phone I also love the fingerprint scanner because it takes its time to calibrate all the possible ways you could place your finger on the scanner Like it a lot would recommend it I am very happy with some of the new features but also disappointed with having to have the location turned on to get the blue  tooth to work The reception on the s7 is not as good as the older s5 In places where the new one breaks up I didnt even know there was a weak signal with the s5 They also removed the the ir sensor  Fastsleeksexy just a few of the many ways to describe the s7 I love the premium look and feel screen is beautiful and all my friends are jealous of my battery life Would definitely recommend Phone is really well designed has a great back camera Very happy with this purchase I previouslyrics owned a Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6 The S7 is by far the best of the phones as far as performance The phone is fast and reliable but switching from ios its not as put together I feel I do have to say s health is the best and most all encompassing health app Ive used the experience with my S4 was great but the advances in technology in this 7 Edge is hard to match Thank You This phone is genius The resolution is great and the fingerprint feature is awesome The phone is great aside from the size the phone is overall great I love the low light camera and the fact its waterproof Great phone once you get use to it Wish the battery did not run down quickly I love the design of the phone with the curved edges There are so many useful features like smart health were it measure foot steps heart rate stress level water intake and many more features with smart health I love the camera quality and video quality with many options such as slow motion and time lapse The overall performance of the phone is always fast and reliable The battery last all day and with the quick charge cord it only takes about an hour to get to full charge I had an S5 and my girlfriend had an S6 When it came time to upgrade I went to the S7 and Im pretty disappointed The only big difference is it can go under waterWoopteedoo Bring back the remote IR sensor since the S6 has it and can do everything the S7 can Im not impressed with your updated phone Upgraded my note 3
Everything works perfectexcept when you change themes youll lose the actual date on your calender Meets and exceeds my expectations The s7 is the best phone I have ever had I absolutely love it I went from an S4 to the S7 and am so happy with this phone The battery life is so much better The camera and all the other features are fantastic So happy I made the purchase The Galaxy S7 has great features excellent battery life and a solid design All the apps you are used to are there except for the music player I suppose they want me to use Samsung Milk Music or something Still highly recommend I have owned various Samsung phones over the years this is THE WORST product ever offered You can not hold the phone without touching all the side nonsense You are unable to text without one of the side items opening and taking you somewhere else all together I turned off the side capabilities and the keyboard still isnt right Im not sure if its a different set up than the Note or if its a sensing issue but its terrible Also the battery does NOT stay charged more than an hour and a half I am not sure why but I assume it has something to do with all the side things but it ate thru my alloted data unimaginably fast I would not only not recommend to a friend I wouldnt recommend to an enemy Love the new feature of fingerprint ID The rest of the features are much the same as my Samsung Galaxy S4 at least as far as Ive discovered so far The Galaxy s7 Edge is one the most comfortable nicest and quality phones that I have every held The Galaxy S7 Edge makes a statement with out you even say anything The craftsmanship this product is far superior to anything on the market First Samsung I have owned seems to be a nice phone I liked my galaxy 5 and the galaxy 7 is just as good with a better camera and other nice features Ivery had this phone for a week and I love what I see so far A definite upgrade from my s5 Smooth transition love the fact you can switch back and forth between text and looking at pictures without closing out the text message I upgraded to this phone from the Samsung Galaxy S4 and it was a great decision It does everything that the S4 did only better The display is clear and easy to read the speakers give high quality sound and the performance is fast and efficient I needed a phone that could do everything from monitoring workout information to downloading and playing music and this phone does it with no problems Definitely one of the best phones Ive owned The Galaxy 7 has everything I need along with great battery life and very fast charging Picture quality is great and has fun features The size is just right not too wide but large enough to stream and watch movies I switched from the iPhone 6 and let me say that I love not being restricted from doing what I want with my it have lots of freedom All of the features on this phone are great From the OS to the edge screens and the ability to customize the experience across the entire device Greatest phone Ive owned The curved screen of the 7 Edge takes a little getting used to because thev1 q 0 and political are on the bias of the edge But once you get the hang of the touch areas it becomes just as easy as a flat display

Love the phone Fun to use I had the S5 and I like the upgraded features and the new ones as well I been using samsung since the S5 and this is the best phone out Everything that made the s5 amazing plus the features that made the s6 good and put it all in a phone with even more stuff that is amazing and you have the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge I love this phone It is nothing less than extraordinary My wife  was very unhappy with her LG phone that we turned it in and had to pay it off We upgraded to a Samsung 7 My wife really enjoys her new phone This phone is the best thing for anyone who plays mobile games the performance is perfect for maxing out graphics quallity while also still achieving amazing 60 fps frame rate and you can share your amazing game play with others with the phones preinstalled game recording software that allows you to share to social media Ive had mutiple smartphones from many companys Samsung has revolutionized the way these phones are meant to be used Water resistancy is a huge feature that I love about this phone No more lifeproof cases all I need is a tempered glass screen protector and a decent case and im fully covered from accidental drops Especially in small puddles or in the toilet Overall the speed and camera on the phone is amazing Battery last a whole day with a good amout of usage Best of all wireless charging Ive previously had the S4 and S6 Really enjoying this phones features the battery life the alwayson display which seems to help with battery not checking constantly and not worrying about getting some rain or condensation from a drink on the phone Overall a great device This phone is great compared to my friends iPhone 6s and this phone has a better camera and just overall fell to it when you hold it in your hand I finally joined the world of smart phones  and am still learning the features of this phone  Generally its quite intuitive and easy it just takes a little getting used to since I was used to a much older phone I have not had a new phone in over 5 years Wow what an improvement So easy to navigate and get around this phone Very quick and responsive to work on Samsung has been such a good product for me the S7 has met or exceeded my expectations I was pleasantly surprised how light and relatively small the new S7 is to hold in hand Though a bit longer than I am used to the width and depth are exceptional 

The features just keep getting better and better Particularly useful is the Smart Switch which made transferring everything from my old phone to the S7 a breeze


Very pleased with the S7 On both phones we have had to do factory resets Clearly didnt beta test the phones enough DONT BUY This is the best phone I have ever owned and will tell everyone I know about this phone It charges real fast and I receive 5 bars in the mountains awesome My other service only receive 1 bar in the mountains I love it I have had the phone for one week and have not taken any photos yet Bought it last week and I really like it
Thank you to the sale person at best buy Brian answering all our questions  My neighbor was having issues with his phone and we sent him to talk to best buy and he purchased one also I just received my new Galaxy S7 Edge yesterday and Im already blown away Not only does the phone look gorgeous it also feels durable The ease of use is incredible with all the familiar android appeal plus Samsung tailored apps The edge feature has been improved since the S6 with more versatile panels to choose from making my day go smoother with quicker accessibility to my favorite apps To top it off the camera takes impeccable pictures I cant wait to share all the memories I will capture with friends and family Thank you Samsung for creating the best phone on the market Ive only had it for a week but I love it I just bought the phone and it is everything that I was expecting  I am not that tech savvy so all of the features I will probably not use but it is great thus far My parents love the phone I got foe them Great picture quality   Easy to easy Lots of fun little things I am so glad I upgraded to the Galaxy S7  I had gone from an S4 to S6 and  hated every second I owned the S6  Was skeptical but went with Verizons suggestion and am so happy I did The phone is easy to use and much faster than the S3which was my previous phone This a great device I love all the new features Samsung always come out with great products Look and feel is great performance is good nice Edge feature It has more options very good for memory extension and it comes by default with 32GB memory 

WIFI hotspot search is poor my previous phone iPhone 6 was very good Getting heat when I use the device more than 15 mins Size is little bigger but that is fine Inbuilt speaker is not good Music output is not liking Overall I am very happy with this phone My device requirements were pretty simple  something that takes nice photos has expandable memory for music and photos and can handle reddit  and it does all of these things well 

There seemed to be less bloatware on this device  or at least its easier to disable than with previous Android phones 

Some new features that I like include the improved screencapping feature where you can take several screenshots and it will connect them together if you wish doubletapping the home button to turn on the camera and the alwayson display that shows the time and text notifications even when the screen is off I also like that the phone charges really quickly and has wireless charging options 

The only con I have is that the battery dies much faster than my Galaxy S5 However I knew this going into the purchase so it wasnt much of a surprise

Again very happy with the device so far I loved my S5 so this was a natural next step for me I love the phone took minimal time to understand and use all the features However the touch screen is very sensitive even after I tried to adjust it Once my case came in the mail and I put it in the case it relieved much of the sensitivity issues Also my last phone had Beats Audio speakers so I got spoiled I suppose I wish this phone had better speakers Overall it is a great phone Im on the ocean almost daily and love just having it with me being able to get hit by the waves and not worry about ithe I love the camera the easier to hold and feature Had no plans to update as I had S6 for only 3 months but once I saw this one I had to have it Love love This is the best phone Ive ever owned Samsung is top notch I love the phone it works great for whatever i need to do Has met all exception lots of new features Needed an upgrade on my phone and decided to go with the s7  more than impressed with the camera and the ease in use Previous iPhone users No issues transitioning Love the battery and water resistance Kudos to Samsung as the brand iterates perfectly on an already awardwinning smartphone adding a brilliant camera and gorgeous design The screen is larger yet somehow the phone doesnt feel too much bigger in the hand The back does have one issue though its a fingerprint magnet however you would go for a case that should take of that 
Awesome display great battery back up super fast charging micro SD slot edge display camera are some of the top selling points for the Samsung S7 edge Love the phone works great easy to work  After start up issue when phone locked me out got that fixed back to working great Just bought phone but I really love it as far as a phone goes Samsung does a good job of making a quality phone the features of the S7 could be a little better but this opinion could be based on the limitations of the carrier and not necessarily Samsung the performance and battery life are quite impressive I noticed a substantial improvement over my last phone between not only load times but also battery life through the standby and active use modes the design could have been a little thicker while this may seem like a trivial personal opinion considering I have average size hands and constantly I inadvertently hit the screenbuttons is bothersome the two above mentioned cons are not something that could affect everyones review of the phone but it is something that did catch mine Really fantastic experience with this phone Super fast able to do all tasks i throw at it and really holds up to hard use I was an I phone user for many years but recently decided to switch to the Samsung What a difference I love the Samsung S7 the apps are great the screen is large and the pictures come of fantastic I will never go back to an I phone Love love love this phone I would have given a 5 star were it not for being bombarded with 10 emails a day This was my choice to upgrade from a Galaxy S5 It was the right choice My Galaxy S5 served me wonderfully for two years and I knew I wanted to stay with the Galaxy line From the moment I picked it up in the store I knew that I was going to be amazed 

Every aspect of the phone is great The first thing you notice is the weight of the phone It is very light weight but doesnt feel flimsy The outer shell shines and makes the phone stand out The display is very clear even at low brightness The camera out preforms any other phone camera it is exceptional in low light areas as well 

Overall the interface is user friendly and would be easy for someone who is switching phones to learn It takes some time to get used to the Edge features but when you get used to them it makes you wonder how you ever lived without them

If you are debating whether or not to get this phone get it It performs better than any other phone I have ever had It really is the total package I bought two Samsung Galaxy S7 phones  I transfered content from my old phone HTC M8 using Smart Switch  It was quick and simple I will never switch to another phone as long as i can still use my SD card Best phone ever for taking a picture and watching a movies I have had an iphone for many years and have make the change to Samsung with the Samsung S7 edge Loving the feel look and functionality of this phone This is a great phone for business or personal use I had Note3 got S7 but traded to larger screen edge I have only had S7edge for few weeks and Im not lovin but not hating The edge makes it difficult to put screen protector on and then put in spek case it popsup in big bubbles on side Battery is great Camera is good could use better auto lighting in nightclub environment Body of phone is slim and sleek almost slippery wo case The galaxy s7 is by far my favorite phone of all Ive had all samsung phones from the s2 on up and including the note I appreciate the operating system and function of the entire phone I have already had several Samsung products and they have always been great The Edge 7 is no different I love this item I have a Samsung Curved TV 55 inch earphones tablet The phone works super fast It is light years above my old blackberry I love finding and using all the different features on my Galaxy 7s The double click for camera use is especially one of my favorites Now I can get that shot I would have missed with my other phone I have always been a Samsung product lover This phone is awesome I do not purchase new technology most features do not impress me and older technology is perfectly fine and a fraction of the cost

Replaced an S4 Active which still works The reviews on this phone praised among other features the battery life I am not a fan of carrying extra batteries or having to put my phone in a bulky and heavier battery case or stopping at a charging station at the airport Mobile should mean mobile not tethered

We have arrived Battery life is excellent and I can easily go all day untethered to anything

Camera performance will easily satisfy a professional Operating system updates allow for themes So you can break away from the traditional and personalize the phone like you would your desktop PC 

NFC and Samsung Pay work So credit cards are now backup rather than primary

This phone is a keeper and it would difficult for anyone to take it from my hands I recently purchased a Samsung Edge 7 and am very happy with it I havent tried to put it under the water or dropped it into a fountain yet but I am sure that it would pass either test It has some of the features that my S5 had but has so many more that I havent had the time to delve into I am very happy with the design but did have a learning curve with the edges because the outside letters do go around the curve But I would highly recommend this phone to anyone out there that likes a challenge of a new phone I left Samsung for 78 years because I wasnt impressed with their phones any more this phone changed all of that The design apps and gear are much better than any other brand on the market So far this phone has been super The only negative I can think of is the battery life seems to be shorter than quoted Other that that I am very pleased with the new phone The only thing I dont like is the newer phones keep getting bigger So far I have been very pleased with the S7 High performance The hearbeat sensor is a cool feature though I do not really use that For those that use the SView I would have liked to have seen some better options for the the SView I also like the idea of being able to put a 200GB SD card i had a lot of problems with the samsung galaxy s7 edge i got one and the second week i had it it started by its self and typing its self and getting in to my text messages and it would open up my apps and tried to get in to my facebook and my bank info so we had to do a factory reset so i just told them to send me another one they send me a new phone and they did but the same day i could not text no one or download or get my email so i just change phones so now i have a samsung galaxy s7 active and i have not had no problems with that one i love it
 but dont get me wrong i like the samsung galaxy s7 edge but it did not work for me  but i will always get me the new samsungs when they come out with a new one Awesome camera Speed of the device is amazing and edge features are so cool Great design and features great screen colors and sound quality Im a devoted fan of all things Samsung My S7 is a perfect example  If you have owned a Samsung phone before you will not be disappointed in the new S7 The phone is easy to use and easy to understand  I am enjoying my Samsung products Ive standardized on everything from TVs appliances SmrtThings Hub and now my phone The phone has the best features of any phone Ive used so far iPhonesWindows 8  10 etc 

My only complaint is that getting used to the edge features takes a little time  For example the characters on the edge in keyboard boad are sometimes hard to hit properly I am very pleased with the waterproof feature because I like to wash dishes while listening to Milk Music the phone might fall in one day Ive been very impressed with the Galaxy S7s performance It is crisp without any lag in performance and there is a lot of flexibility for personalization within the settings choices The cameras produce sharp images and the display is exceptionally clean The Galaxy S7 is the one to beat for 2016 Great phone So glad i got this Samsung hit a home run My new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is the best phone I have ever had I love the camera speed and the amazing color and clarity I will never buy anything else but Samsung If your torn between the phones I looked at both for a while and iphone storage no you get a choice and thats it S7 edge more storage no problem just add more so its a win Iphone rain ooops water no way its dead S7 edge rain no worries spills no sweat oops no plunk in the bowl costly replacment wait time frustration no way heaven forbid the awful bowl dip but it can ans is built to take it Just rinse it off clean it and your good to go Dont dare think of this with most other phones so yes it dares to strut its stuff THE S7 EDGE IS AN IPHONE KILLER HANDS DOWN AND ITS A MUST OWN PHONE People you have to see all it can offer and do many features you like in the iphone are here too its just to much to list Loved its so much gave one to my wife HD calling she seriously would not after a week was done and sold off her Iphone as fast as she could Has all the latest features I wanted Very dependable I had held on to my S4 for a few years over it being good enough for my needs It still is really Then I saw the 7 Water resistant expandable storage that was missing from later models way better performance the nature inspired look the S3 brought that piqued my interest into Samsung phones to begin with and thats all it took I needed this phone and was way overdue for an upgrade It was birthday too so why not treat myself I havent put this thing down much since The Gear VR integration helped and its amazing to see how far it has come from earlier versions in my youth I can take care of business get in touch with who I need to and watch a movie in my own private theater after defending a space ship from invading forces All with one phone What else could you ask for I switched to the Galaxy s7 edge from an iPhone 6s The galaxy is by far better in every way possible Better camera everything is more customizable Its an all around better phone Great phone good feel in your hand its pretty its fast Kinda wish the speaker was louder but thats hardly something to complain about I was waiting on the S7 The camera works great battery life is better than expected its very easy to use and looks amazing What more could you want I dont like a lot of the auto features The earphone plug on the bottom is a inconvenience The speaker doesnt have good sound just to name a few The Samsung Galaxy S7 is my favorite phone so fargreat battery life phenomenal camera and water resistant Seriouslywho can top that I upgraded from s5 and this is truly a great step up Read the reviews and watch the videos Get one and never look backvery much enjoying this phone Battery life a lot better than my S6 and faster loading apps I love my galaxy S7 It a great size and has wonderful features It even tracks my steps and will check my stress levels This android is super easy to use super fancy and cool phone  is that simple you will love it I Love Samsung products I live with Samsung products my 1st color tv was a Samsung color tv tuner that I bought when I was 16yrs old  it stood with me for 15yrs now 45yrs young  in my house all the tvs are Samsung and will not have it any other way  will not allow any other brand in my home And since Samsung smartphone has been in the market I have been a Samsung consumer And I Love my Galaxy 7 Edge I love all the features and the big sceen Plus it loads things quick This phone is awesome i love that its waterproof the fast wireless charging is great and curved sceen is great for notifications and health steps I would highly recommend this phone to anybody who loves galaxy phones versatility love it easy to use Its totally awesome with all the great features Every Samsung product I own is great This is my 3rd Samsung phone and by far the very best It is super fast in navigating the Web and it has so many extra features that previous models did not The camera takes beautiful pictures  My husband has an iPhone but I would choose the S7 over that any day I love love this phone The charging cable charges the phone super fast as well My first impression after going back to the Galaxy models is that there is great attention to usability for the owner Easy to set up and easy to customize The battery life is VERY good and pages load quickly Excellent Camera Upgraded from a s4 active and this phone beats it by miles in every category I have had many many many Samsung products and I have enjoyed them all however this one takes the cake First of all the ability to change the total theme of the phone without downloading an extra program is excellent Then the device being as intuitive as it is makes the process of just selecting an app to use simpler Finally the fact that this is probably the strongest phones I have ever had that includes the ones I had while serving in the Marines that were supposedly military grade which gives me the confidence that this probably the safest I felt with a cell phone Thank you Samsung for a simply EPIC phone Semper Fi Not as dramatic an improvement over Motorola Droid Maxx Battery drain actually worse reception similar Easier to handle Speed reasonable but not significantly faster Its a great device so far I hope it lasts sine previous products werent good at all2 years and the product would be over So far the phone is great I love all of the Samsung specific apps and I love how responsive it is I do think the battery burns quicker than my old m8 though Love it Takes great pictures and the audio on the videos is great I upgraded from a Samsung Note 4 which is an awesome phone hubby is enjoying it now I kind of wondered how much better can a phone actually get It gets a lot better Besides the fact that it is a beautiful phone I get to enjoy a screen size almost as large as the Note without so much bulk It is speedy and responsive and Marshamallow is a great upgrade Touchwiz has come a long way also The screen is bright and beautiful and the camera really performs especially in low light I cannot bring myself to submerge this phone to test the waterproofness nor will I Im just glad to know that in case of a water accident it should survive Fingerprint recognition is way better than the Note 4 Im glad because I use it when using Samsung Pay The App installed seamlessly and I have had no problem getting it to work at several different stores I have a clear case on the back of the phone to protect from scratches Problem is once you put a case on the back its very had to have one on the front This is the first time I have not had a screen protector on the glass of my phone I am very careful and so far so good I did receive the Gear VR this week mine came as a promotion with the phone and have only used it a couple of times It is very cool I watched a couple of 360 videos and you can turn all the way around in your seat and see behind yourself You actually feel like you are in the movie I will be exploring a bit more this weekend I am very glad that after sitting on the fence for a couple of months I finally decided to get this phone Its great Fastsuperior pictures works well with gear vr Buy another you bet The galaxy S7 edge has a very sleek and modern appearance It has some nice features but ithe doesnt allow you to talk on the phone and surf the Web unless you have a 4G connection I had no problem doing both on my s4 but with the s7 I have no Internet connection most of the time Im on the phone I also drop A LOT more calls since upgrading to the S7 I have been with Verizon for 10 years and this is my first time having a problem with the service 

The phone is very durable and water resistant It survived a day at the waterpark and several drops and still works and looks fine Battery life is better than my past phones and the camera takes great pictures The screen is bright and very clear even when I dont have the brightness all the way up I have had this phone for a little over 2 weeks and I dont really like it I always accidentally press button and it messes everything up Its very slow I wish I could send it back Not to mention I cant have a case and a screen protector A great design and a beautiful phone The edge feature is a breakthrough for cell phones It does take some time to get used to its full utilization Easy to hold and use Only complaint is that it is a finger print magnet I have has several Samsung Galaxy phones it this is the best so far S7 edge is the seventh addition to my Samsung collection I love everything about it I bought the S7 for my wife on her birthday and since thenIve been in love with the S7 Unfortunately my S4 stopped working 2weeks after ending its 3yrs service I got a gear classic gift on Fathers day And hopefully get a Tab to complement my gadgetsand become a Samsung ambassadorribtickling Definitely worth havingI love my S7 edge I love this phone for the camera The focus is top notch Also the video this phone takes is awesome The main problem I have had is the battery life The battery does not last I have to charge my phone at least once during the day if I dont use it often If I use it a lot throughout the day then I have to charge it at least twice But overall the performance of this phone is great Ive never had it overheat or freeze The Samsung Galaxy edge S7 is easy to use It is very fast with games and online activity I am loving it so far Sexy fast and bright Camera is always on point Ive owned many phones but the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is the best phone Ive ever had Bought the S7 to replace a dying S3 Love it I researched for a long time before upgrading my Galaxy S5 I didnt like anything about the S6 When the S7 came out I waited and researched I love that the ability to add more storage was back much better camera and much better speed I especially loved that so many of those preinstalled apps are in folders not taking up space I would recommend this any tme I love my new phone Features are a lot better Just wished battery lasted longer and that didnt drop calls in dead spots I like this phone I bought it because I wanted a high performance phone and this phone is it I absolutely love my Samsung 7edge Its sleek look is awesome  its new features are amazing My Samsung 3 had seen better days but I hated to change phones anyway I have been pleasantly surprised at how easy it has been for me to get used to it This product is very sleek to touch its beautiful lightweight and definitely something I would buy again
 It has great features the camera is topnotch and for a mum of a growing toddler the water and shatter proof feature is number one Thumbsup Samsung This phone looks and feels great The edge feature maximizes the screen space while still keeping the design sleek Love everything about this phone if I had one complaint it would be about the design and how the ear phone jack is on the bottom instead of the usual top This is the only gripe other than that I would give this phone a solid 48 gotta love samsung the phones keep getting better and better Enjoying phone and still finding new thing it can do Battery life is a lot better then expected The only thing is find a case I like because of curved screen Using the unicorn beetle The only con is I wished they would have two speakers instead of the one Really enjoy this phone  It was easy to transfer my information from my 4 to the 7 This phone is amazing I only own Samsung products from my phones to accessories for my phones Samsung watches and my Samsung Smart TV Samsung is innovative and always ahead of the market in every product they make Very sleek design and wonderful features Thanks Samsung 

Teresa I HAVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH IT IS A SUPERIOR UPGRADE FROM THE S4 IN Upgraded from the s4  S7 has much better features and battery last longer Camera is very fast and very clear I wish I could still use Samsung link This phone is good for help with exercise videos everyday life The camera is fanominal The low light feature is just insanely good and useful The edge feature allows me to quickly and quietly check my emails even in class The water resistance has already saved my phone plenty of times from being garbage and has gotten me some really cool pictures I love this phone No complaints Still discovering things So far so good I bought this phone a few days ago I dont like it Its very difficult to figure out how to use  All the keys are too small for my fingers and the users manual is so small I cant read it without a magnifying glass Also the picture of the keys in the manual doesnt match my phone Havent yet figured out how to text my contacts without having to retype their phone numbers  Have yet to fins anything I like about Wish I hadnt bought it finally got rid of my S4 What was I waiting for Phone is great This my third samsung phone in this series The S7 is lighter and faster I only wish there was a bigger batyery option Otherwise It is a great phone I really enjoy this phone Its fast diverse and durable lol Truly a work of art Only thing that makes me cringe is that it is prone to slip anywhere when not in a case Besides that it is a true masterpiece of technology 1010 I absolutely love my phone The design is amazing the features are awesome I really love the edge technology and the option to have multiple screens and do different things The only negative comment I have is that the phone actually factory reset itself I called Verizon they advised its a known issue I love how it also has the flashlight built in and Flash in the front Its a little weird to have the speaker on the bottom and the headset Jack on the bottom as well as the SIM and memory card on the top instead of inside the phone but overall its a good phone and I really like it I really also love the option to change the theme of the phone Up until now I have had every phone in the Note with ATT I am now a Verizon man and I am very happy But most of all I am a Samsung person for life in fact I now have 11 products that are from the Samsung family I had the s4 for about 3 to 4 years and loved it I broke the glass and touch pad so I got the s7 I love the s7 even more The stuff the s7 can do and the look of it is wonderful I use it with the VR goggles and it is something you must see for your self to appreciate it They are tough phones and knowing the s7 is water resistant up to 5 feet of water is a comfort I must also mention the camera quality very good who needs a separate camera when you have this nice of one built into the phone I had an IPhone before the s4 and found it liked the s4 better and now the s7 is awesome I love my new s7 edgethe picture quality is the best out there when taking pictures the camera is awesome even at night its super fast and I love the fact that it has extended memory for your SD card 1 out of 10 I give it a 12  Thank you Samsung for a great phone Kinda heavy a little bigger then my Samsung Galaxy alpha I cant even find the words to even described how I feel about this phone in fact I am thinking of getting my mother and similar phone but different color for her birthday I was happy to see the return of the additional storage feature and the water resistant feature I have been using the phone for a week now and i really like it compared to the droid turbo i had  Samsung pay is a cool feature as I have been able to use it more then android pay  This phone seems to work better with my Gear s2 3g as well  So far no issues  Battery was ok the first few days but it is better now This phone is great and easy to use only had it a week and love itlight weight makes it easy to carry and the tabs on the edge are a plus I am so happy I chose the 7 edge This phone works well in my less flexible older hands Response is lively as you move through the screens and apps I found the movement of stuff from my old phone to be easy and fast I like it This phone has the best battery life I work 12 hours days and use the phone a lot The battery has no problem keeping up with me I love the the smoothness of the phone along with the fact that it was easy to transition from my old phone to this one Love the design Eady to use and long battery life I also love that it charges really quick Had it for two weeks A few features such as playing music Im a little upset with not the same as the 6s But overall pleased with the phone My parents bought this phone for me I love the features The camera takes great photos and videos I have a special cover for it so it can take pictures under water My parents bought the Samsung which was more expensive than the iPhone6 because the Samsung screen is thicker than the iPhone and the Samsung is water resistant and the iPhone is not I am enjoying my new phone and its features Its by far the best phone Ive ever owned I own an ipod 5g Now that I have the s7 I barely use my ipod I love my phone Im so grateful I went back to android and the s7 is the best of the androids and Ive ever had The gear links the memory space sleek design easy to customize Hands down love it Makes me wonder why I ever went back to iPhone Best Samsung phone I have owned yet Love the Edge features and being able to see all my messages on the side without logging in love it I just started with this new phone S7 and it is easier than my old S6 just fantastic I really like this phone its a good upgrade and I think you should get it it works good its features are good and everything The best phone I have seen Great working system great camera great battery life and elegant looking phone Wonderful phone for an upgrade Vastly superior than any other phone I had before Design is wonderful Only downside is the 2nd glass screen protector I purchased is making the phone sluggish to response time I recommend just to get a protective case and not a 2nd glass screen protector 55 Good speed screen resolution and easy to use  Wish battery lasted a little longer but who doesnt regardless of phone  Love the quick recharge time though  Goes from low battery to full charge in about an hour or so The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a Great Phone except for one thing Memory management and having the ability to access that memory for applications is not there Documents photos and music are all that can be placed on added SD cards When I speak of memory I am referring to added above the 32 GB of system memory For me the space is used for applications is far higher than what I use for documents music and photos That is the only reason I dropped one star from the rating

The phone is beautiful and solidly built The screen is high resolution and clear I do stream movies regularly and they are a joy to watch Actually I tend to use my phones more as a tablet than the phone

I have had several the S3 the S6 Edge and now the S7 Edge With the exception of memory management they have all been great devices 

The added benefit of the new phones are the Oculus Gear With the new tech we are seeing and Virtual Reality being more than science fiction the S7 gives us a tool to enjoy what VR offers The galaxy S7 is a good phone reliable and the only thingi really dislike is the fact that screen protector is not wide enoughit annoying to see the sides of the protectorit forms a prizm as you move the screen it rotates like a barbers pole it annoying at times it clearly has to be full14 inch wider the other thing is the buttons on the side are to small and if you are in a rush you will push the wrong button if you can find itover all its a very good phone Ive always used a blackberry style keyboard phone up til now The Galaxy S7 was so easy to use and the transition made me say why didnt I switch earlier Best phone I have ever owned Does everything I want it to do and much more S7 has several great features such as Samsung pay Battery life is good when running WiFi and blue tooth features Works great with Samsung Gear features The s7 works great has a great camera and great sound for a phone The only down fall is the screen is curved so finding a glass protector that fits is difficult The picture on the Galaxy S7 Edge is so clear and the sound is amazing The overall of this phone is great sleek texture good battery life and alot of apps to use  I do love my new smart phone but the transition from a flip phone is a steep learning curve Some things which should be obvious seem to me hard to find like how to turn off all noise temporarily Notifications phone etc Also buying just the basic accessories added up to quite a bit I bought a case screen protector and wireless charger so far works really great and has few extra new feature s i love I have recommended the s7 to a couple worker she now has a s7 and loves it I enjoy my s7 good featurespictures awesome Loving my new galaxy s7 in gold Display is clear and picture quality is great I have had several other phones before this one I think this one out preforms all the other brands that I had Easy to use good graphics and great features I am excited and pleased I went from the Samsung 4 my husbands hand me down to the S7 after my 4 died completely Fortunately the cloud backup restored most of the features to the new phone and I just needed to add my apps giving me an opportunity to pare the number down I am truly enjoying the camera on the 7 It takes fantastic pictures that I can really be proud of I like the fact that the phone is water resistant and not easily damaged when dropped The phone has so many wonderfu l features that I am still discovering Ive teamed it up with the Samsung wireless charger and love how quickly it charges and how long the battery lasts Coming in as a long term Note 3  4 user it took some time to get used to the S7s smaller screen but Im growing attached I wasnt sure Id like the Gold option but it is quite a much more attractive phone in person Display is awesome and the processor speed blows the Note 4 away

Its difficult to rate it much higher than average because features are pretty much standard across the Android platform I do love the ability to select multiple fingerprints instead of just one so I can operate onehanded with either hand 

The biggest downside to this particular phone is the inability to obtain a quality glass screen protector because the screen edges are curved too much for a protector to lay completely flat which makes it a great place to gather dustdirt particles Also too easy for the protector to peel off For the couple out there that do lay flat they are inset about 18 on both sides to avoid the curve You can still see the screen fine but its annoying and unattractive 

Overall Id recommend this phone but get a good case that protects the screen too And dont submerge it even though they tout it being water resistant with fancy commercials IF it gets wet inside youre on the hook for any damage This new phone that I got is awesome The battery lasts much longer than my old phone It is easy to use and was so easy to transfer files from old phone So simple even I could do it This phone is very good so far It does everything that I can do on my iPad and more since my iPad doesnt have the calling feature This phone takes very clear and sharp pics too Screen resolution is terrific Rapid and wireless charging are great features I switched from the S6 so Im not seeing anything drastically different than it is But I was happy with the S6 so that means Im happy with the S7
The best part to me is the fact that it has water resistance again I never thought that I would use the edge display I got the phone because of the bigger battery and screen but I use the edge a lot I just wish there was more I can do with it Samsung Galaxy 7 edge is the best phone I ever had samsung made phone when the 7 edge came out thinks samsung I am totally satisfied with my new Galaxy 7 phone It is easy and smooth to use Upgraded from the S4 and the transition was seamless Most everything is similar but just more of it I use it with the new S2 gear watch It is actually fun to use I would recommend it highly to anyone that is considering a new phone Only upsides no downsides detected Having a blast with my phone now At first was not sure I would learn the new format but once I got going I am all over the place and it pops up ideas and feature suggestions that are useful Great upgrade from the S6 Battery life is amazing The camera takes amazing pictures It allows you to use RAW files to edit later as well This Samsung Galaxy 7 phone is very light weight and great design The only negative is battery life I have to charge it at least twice a day because it doesnt hold a charge for even 24hrs Very disappointed with the battery life Ive read and tried everything suggested I wouldnt mind needing to charge it once a day but not several times a day with normal usage isnt acceptable The setting is on power save mode It is an ok phone not worth the money asked for it But no phone is I upgraded to a Galaxy S7 after using an HTC Droid Incredible for 55 years I have had the new phone for about three weeks It does what I need it to I can make calls surf the web respond to emails take decent pictures etc I really like that the phone can be unlocked via fingerprint as it makes unlocking the phone incredibly fast Also the fact that it is waterproof is really nice

There are only two things that I would change about the phone if possible 1 size this is the first phone Ive had that is this large 5 screenI would prefer a slightly smaller phone 5 screen but I am adjusting to one of this size 2 nonremoveable battery all of my previous phones had removeable batterieswhile the sealed battery is doing fine for now I am unsure of its longterm performance I have always been an iphone user but switched to a galaxy s7 edge Its easy to learn to use and has unique features I loved the galaxy s5 it was a beast of a phone and met all the requirements I needed from a mobile device Great camera with good dynamic range good resolution screen fast processor sufficient RAM expandable memory durable construction The s7 was an easy choice to upgrade from the s5 It meets and surpasses all specs from the s5 galaxy 

Im very happy with the performance out of the s7 Their simplistic design not only makes these look slick but these phones are also easy to handle I really dont want to put a case on the phone because of their design but I have to do that to protect the device
The most important thing I like with the phone is the number of features it provides over the iPhone Even though I may be using only few of these features that are available on the phone but its always exiting to play with these additional features
I recently started using Samsung Pay Its awesome My wallet is trimming down with no credit cards or membership cards to carry
Gadgets like Gear VR  Watch are perfect fit with the phone and its a whole lot of story to talk about these
These are only just few I wanted to mention but there are a lot more talk about this phone may be for a later time 
I love this Samsung phone Love the feel of the phone The options are great and app downloads are quick and easy Samsung Galaxy S7 has an amazing design an awesome camera a great gaming app that can record my phone games long battery life extra microSD storage slot wireless charging and is waterresistant This phone has no competition I love that this phone is waterproof that everything loads quickly and the camera is awesome plus I love that it came with 32 gb plus you can add a SD card Everything about the phone is good I really like the design of the gold model and how its shiny The only two features of the phone that have to be improved are the camera and fingerprint reader Comapred to the LG G5 the S7 edge camera is lacking Some photos I take are too sharp or bright whereas the G5 would capture the true colors and wont over sharpen images The fingerprint reader could be faster and improved Sometimes is says my finger doesnt match or nothing would happen at all making it so I have to put my finger on the button again Other than that the phone is nice to have and Im happy with it I had the first Samsung 4G phone the charge and hated everything about it Switched to LG  HTC with no problems and very happy After my M8 wore out I was waiting on HTC 10 and decided to try out a S7 Wow I was impressed on every level performance style features etc  The only thing I can find that is not perfect the expandable SD wont work as internal memory like stock marshmallow Truly cant find any other issues Well done Samsung This is the greatest phone Ive ever used theres nothing this phone cant do its the best ease of access Ive seen Absolutely love it It is a great phone It is slippery but can be fixed with a case The speakers are not the best One time I thought they didnt work but then I realized I had my finger over it but that is due to the water resistance of the phonespeakers Overall I really like it and enjoy using it I enjoy the size of the phone and the features for media The sound and picture is great And the battery life is great Waiting for this phone has been worth it Great price when bought refurbished Although the Google voice has inconsistent volume and I cant seem to find a fix for it I am really glad that Samsung put an expansion slot back in this phone I take a lot of pictures  video so I use a lot of memory I also really like the tab home button twice to get to camera feature much faster camera access Good product This is a great size to read and send texts and emails Very quick and responsive to requests Easy to use and pics are clear and easy to work with Sound is clear and very pleasing i dont know what to other then i wish i had a Micro SD Card I was amazed at the wonderful improvements of the S7 over the S4 I previously owned The one thing I was pleased to see was the SD Card slot which was as I understand not on the S5 and S6 versions The display sound and camera on the S7 are impressive and the fact the the phone is water resistant was another bonus I cannot say enough about the S7 I would highly recommend it for anyone All 5 stars
I love the performance design and all the features it has to offer Would highly recommend this smartphone to all of my friends The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is one of Samsungs latest and best devices ever made The quality of the device is solid and the performance is quite stellar I havent had any issues when playing games or during every day tasks The battery life is much improved over last years model and it never fails to last me the entire day The camera quality is absolutely amazing as well If youre on the fence about your next smart phone purchase look no further than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge This Samsung S7 is fun to use fast and very easy to use I love this phone it has so many useful features Good battery life and easy access to to all apps and features After having so much trouble out of my old S4 this phone is a welcome relief Ive had no problems with my S7 so far and I am very well pleased I would recommend the S7 to all my family and friends Great phone this is a good phone my battery does not last long and i do not like that you can not change the battery with a new one that was one of my biggest reason for choosing Samsung Galaxy over all other smart phones this is still a good phone I loved the s5 I love the s7 even more I bought one for myself and my wife we absolutely love it We havent tried calling while the phones in a fish tank though Has a amazing display great battery life and fast This phone has been a great upgrade from my previous Galaxy S6 A major improvement from the Galaxy s6 is the battery life My Galaxy S6 would die very fast but the S7 lasts all day A couple other improvements are that it is easier to hold in one hand and its water proof I dont care too much for the slightly curved screen It makes it hard to find a good glass screen protector Other than that the galaxy s 7 has been the best android phone that I have ever used hands down I feel that samsung combined the best of the galaxy s5 and the galaxy s6 into one phone I have been an Android user for the past 5 years My previous phone the S5 was another step up in my line of Android phones more specifically in Samsung The S7 is a great phone so far for my job as well as personal life I love the size Slightly smaller than the S5 which is a great fit for my hands With the software and GUI side of the S7 its exactly like the S5 with improved features that helps me achieve the same results The only thing that I would change would be some hardware inserts that I miss from the S5 like the IR blast doubling as a remote control Aside from that I love this phone I love that Samsung brought back the removable SD card it makes life much easier to switch phones if necessary I would highly recommend this phone It is so awesome I love it so much The pictures it takes are so much better than the Samsung Galaxy S5 The best brand on the market today
Samsung stands alone in every category I still havent played with the phone enough to say whether or not its the best phone that I have ever had but it works well has a clear picture and fairly easy to use I absolutely love this phone and all of its features i think that this is the best phone samsung has put out in a long time The device is great and easy to use No real problems I love this phoneand all Samsung productsI have pretty much all the Samsung productsthank you Hands down my favorite phone and the best camera ever Fast and works well with the gadgets I bought for it Comparing with oder Galaxy this is the best is faster good future and applications the only is the battery need recharge more time but the rest is perfect Love this phone plenty of features that are user friendly This phone is fantastic I could not have been happier with this My wife and I have had Samsung products for the past 6 years and we would never change I have had the original galaxy phone up to this one and the whole Note series and this is by far the best one I was so glad that they brought expandable memory back as well This phone fits my life my familys life and our lifestyle All of our Samsung products do We cant wait to add new items to our Samsung ecosystem I recently purchased this phone as a replacement for my Galaxy s5 and I dont regret it the least bit This phones features present an easy way to complete tasks during the day and make entertainment even better The curved edge sides present the phone as if the super AMOLED display were poping right off the glass Its build is so much better than Samsungs original plastic builds where this phone is completely metal and glass that gives an expensive and premium feel The improved camera is also a huge plus especially for someone like me who uses their phone camera on a daily basis this dual pixel 12 mega pixel 17 aperture lens camera is the best you will get anywhere Over all I absolutely without a doubt love the Galaxy S7 Edge and Im glad to be apart of the Samsung Galaxy family Much better preforming than my old S4 Better battery and apps work faster Best phone I have ever used Phone seems to be snappy and quick while I do multitasking and spend most of my day doing multiple things This phone is by far the best phone I have owned Great performance greatt design great features and best of all great battery life This phone is fast makes great calls and crisp photosvideos But the edge feature is not worth it and annoying at times and the phone cracks easily The phones is fast good and waterproof but what I found to be annoying was that if Im doing anything and I try to hold the phone I usually touch the sides and it messes everything up Best phone have used better than iPhone and probably any other android from its water proofing and screen quality best screen Ive seen in smartphones to the battery life last me day and half and the edge features This is my 4th Samsung phone and it is by far the best Really love all the features and the speed and the external charging is fantastic I upgraded from an S5 and I really like the wireless charging I had to learn the symbol keyboard because its different from the earlier models Its actually a better layout once I learned it Over the 2 weeks of using my phone I have loved everything about the phone The most enjoying thing is the camera and recorder on the phone are much better then the camera on the sony phone that I recently had due to how fast the phone adapts to the environment to take a picture Second most enjoying thing is the quick charge on the phone I went from a 4 hour charge phone down to 1 and a half hour charge which saves so much time The settings are also easy to navigate through Another favorite feature is the Ultra battery saver mode It still allows you to use data internet and facebook even while the phone saves more battery The fingerprint reader is very accurate for the unlocking button which I enjoy using The phone is very popular so there are multiple cases and accessories released to the phone The only con of this product is the curved screen on the sides so it leaves for error with screen protectors but is not a big deal as long as you get the proper tempered glass for the screen The only thing I have found wrong with the S7 compared to my note 3 is that the S7 doesnt have an IR reader in it I used the note 3 with my TV all the time and cant do that with the S7 This is an absolutely incredible phone Its incredibly fast doesnt lag or freeze has a lot of internal memory and overall it works really really well The only two bad things are that battery life is a little on the short side but that can be fixed with an extended battery case It also gets a little too hot at times when using the VR specially This is probably due to the need to use more CPU power which kind of makes sense Over all Im so glad I bought this phone and definitely definitely recommend getting it It will absolutely blow your mind I love to utilize the cameras that come on the Galaxy phones but when I couldnt increase my storage physically my S6 began to seem mediocre I love that I can now expand up to 200g and the phone id water resistant It really is the best phone ever and Ive had a few but the phone app doesnt show how many total missed calls and voice messages I have If the iPhone can do it why cant the Samsung Seems like a nobrainer to me I like the features of the camera Its so much easier for me to post pics quickly Just wish the battery lasted a little longer Got the phone yesterday so far I love it I have always been a fan of the Samsung line this phone just has great features with a great product line I bought the phone just before I left for vacation no trouble going to a different location it worked just like I was home I got this phone about two weeks ago and Im very glad that I did It was easy to transition from my old phone to this one The screen is very clear and the camera takes great pictures I love the fingerprint screen lock option This is a great phone I love the feeling of it The way I slide thru the phone is awesome And the screen is amazing the 4k is a great addition to the Galaxy the edge bar is so usefully I can maneuver thru my stuff so easliy Very happy about this upgrade only issue I am having is that the battery life on this phone is not great it dies by the evening everyday my old phone would be good for 2 days or more and this one lasts maybe 12 hours Good Camera Size Features
Bad Glitchy Freezes Slow at times Games lag and drop frames

I am getting decent battery life The device itself is nice and premium feeling The software will freeze coming out of the lock screen or freeze at the lock screen Sometimes it will lag just going in and out of the app drawer or even swiping through screens Not overly thrilled about this purchase This is the best phone Ive ever owned I havent owned a Samsung phone since before smart phones were around This phone has everything I need and more It has ample on board memory to store all of my movies documents music and pictures And in the event the on board memory isnt enough I can expand the memory with a MicroSD card Still learning some of the functions It is an expensive phone but thats understandable for what you get It has a very sturdy feeling metal body and a very powerful processor I can switch between multiple apps with no lag Videos bugger in seconds The 4k video camera is crystal clear even in low light That goes for the 12 megapixel camera too The only drawbacks Ive noticed with the phone are that the shiny body is a fingerprint magnet but it wipes off very easily I also would prefer for the mini USB port and headphone jack to be on top of the phone instead of on the bottom but hey those being my only two complaints this baby is worth every penny

Not that this is a review for the gear vr but I purchased that as well and the two products work very well together I saw a lot of reviews that stated that the users wished the gear vr had its own battery however it does have a charging port on the side that significantly reduces the amount of battery drained from the phone Now it just needs more apps

Hope this review is helpful would like a short booklet showing the features and how to use them love the size of this phone but my edge 6 worked better for some reason and ti this day the s5 has been the best I got my galaxy s7 for mother day I love it it would take nothing for and before I got the s7 I had galaxy s4 I love the fill of it I love the galaxy s7 is light and have my galaxy well protected with the right galaxy grear I love the camera and its features The battery drains quickly which I wasnt expecting from a new phone I am glad that I can add such a large storage card It seems to move slowly which is disappointing This phone is great a little addicted to changing themes It works fast charges fast and last night all day The camera is clear  just all around great phone I went from the galaxy 4 to the galaxy 7s I love it easy to usefantastic camera nice size thin case 
Very happy with it The was excellent in everyway I love this phone First upgrade Ive had since 2012  Easy to use and I learn new things about the phone dailynow I see what all the hype is about To Very good phone I love it No complaints would highly recommend to a friend At 3 weeks of owning the cell There are a few things I will have to get used to but I do like the upgrade So far only down side if syncing music on your phone from your computer and not have to stream it off Verizon cloud  that will over the amount of time I listen to my music eat data If it was the same syncing as the s5 I would be completely head over heals for this cell phone up grade This its the best phone in the market
Check outthis product has great features Im in love with this camera It takes great selfies and the wide selfies Its wonderful for taking group selfies I love this phone It is definitely way better than my last phone which was the s5 The picture quality is beyond great the battery life is amazing its waterproof and the charging time is unbelievable I like the phones features I like that it is waterproof But the battery life is horrible for me And I mostly use my phone for calling and texting I use very little data around 1 gig per mounth I really love this phone Its easy to use and has some great features The camera is great Very clear pictures Overall its a phone that I would recommend to my friends Very easy to handle Charges very quick Love it Great phome great features amazing product
 Would recommend to anyone Only had this phone a day now so far its a great phone I dont care for the speaker as far as when Im on the phone it makes the other persons voice sound weird This productime is easy to use I love it and all Samsung products I absolutely love Samsung products My family plan has 7 devices and they are all Samsung We even have Samsung Smart TVs After looking through all of the phones to get I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge because of my prior ownership of other Samsung phones tvs and tablets In my opinion there is no better phone out there than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge This phone far outweighs ALL other phones which many of my friends have and they are not satisfied with their other EXTREMELY expensive phones and have told me that they would rather have my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I hope all will read this review and go ahead and get the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It is absolutely worth every penny This phone has a really nice design and great features The ebiggest downfall I found is that the battery life isnt great After moderate use the battery only lasts about 8 hours Dont like the idea of having to charge the phone in the middle of the day Nice phone but wish it lasted longer I bough  this phone 2 week ago  I am learning  how tu use it It hits most of the marks Fast good looking great screen waterproof
However IMHO no electronic device can possibly have a builtin non replaceable battery unless said battery can easily last you at least 23 days
This battery is surely better than any Galaxy phone had before and it should last you a day However for some heavy users it will not on some days
Not to mention the FACT that all of these batteries have an expiration date and will most certainly die
Having said that just about in everything else this phone excels It is by far the best phone Ive hadthe only thing I would change is making the back out of plastic not glass This is the reason I didnt like IPhone feels sexy and its huge in size i like it I like itand it works great but I miss my bigger screen phone But it was a good value buy and it has preformed very well The edge S7 Is probably the best phone I ever owned The Camera is better than the S5 as far as long zoom picture quality goes If i was always on my phone before NOW i love being on it Gave up an I phone for this phone and its much easier to use Works great  Husband loves it When my husband and I call each other it sounds like were talking through tin cans  The messaging system is annoying Ive owned the Galaxy S3 S5  and now the S7 I was glad that they brought back the SD card slot That was going to be a deal breaker for me Since it wasnt in the S6 I was wondering what other phone I was going to get 

The battery life is as good as can be expected I really enjoyed having a removable battery But that wasnt a deal breaker The waterproofing is definitely a perk I would say that I do like the always on display That makes it nice not to have to turn your phone on so much to see the time Because I use my phone as a watch 

Also the camera is wonderful Its probably the best feature that it has

I think all in all I really am glad I got a S7 Really fast nice looking phone This phone has all the best features you will never need like water resistance but kept freezing and lack lack of responsiveness made me return this for the note 5 EXCELLENT product im start with the note 2 an now S7 gear 2 gear 2s I love the phone Fast and effective for business The only reason for the 4s are the slick feel of the phone Slippery Without a case you have a constant fear of dropping the phone The back could have been made from a different material Full price is a bit high for a unit that will probably last less than a two year contract If you are a shoulder talker this phone will not work for you right out of the box Thats right the Future in your handThis phone is so advanced I cant tell you all its great features because I learn more and more each day This is by far the BEST phone I have had in my hands ever Sleek yet ruggedWater resistant so no worries about getting it wet Its just a beautiful piece of art waiting for you to jump into the future Great product Love the photo options and the quality music Great all around cell phone Love all the bells n whistles It was an easy transition from my old phone and the pictures are fabulous  Very easy to get photos and contacts from old phone moved over  Clarity is great The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has a great and futuristic design The features are phenomenal and make life a lot easier for the user The Gold platinum color is fantastic I have had the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for a little over three weeks I HIGHLY recommend getting a case that provides more grip than the bare phone does The bare phone is extremely slick and can slip out of your hand and pockets very easily Mine has and the screen has already cracked in numerous places even though the phone hasnt fallen great distances

Note I havent had a phone case in close to 4 years and havent had an issue with broken screens Two weeks with this phone and it was already cracked Hasnt slipped or anything since I got the case

Aside from the slick nature of the phones design I really like the phone and the design Much quicker than the S5 Galaxy that I had is lighter and sleeker Recommend the phone just make sure you get a case and a screen protector if available I love the feel of the keyboard and other features It is easier and faster to use all my favorite apps This phone is more than I expected it to be I am able to use the phone with ease This phone has a great amount of features I had forgotten just how much I enjoy a Samsung phone and the access to all the wonderful android apps etc The phone is easy to hold and I like the edge to edge features It is responsive and enjoyable to use I love everything about this phone Design size features and the edge screens are perfect Samsung is by far on top of their game I previously had a Galaxy Note 4 and the transition was easy Additional functionality makes it easy to use I have my S7 less than a month so I havent found all the features yet but what I have seen I like I like the water resistance but havent tested it and really hope I never do I like that I can have the always on screen but then when it goes in a pocket or purse it shuts that off thus saving the battery The quick charger that it comes with is great with it the phone goes from almost dead to fully charged in no time I moved to this from a Samsung 4 mini so the getting used to the larger size is interesting  at times I love it other times I hate it It is lighter than I thought the larger phone would be which is great This was a very good upgrade During everyday use I discover some other feature or function that makes using the phone that much more nifty and convenient like recognizing key words in my texts and asking if I would like to add an event mentioned into my calander Overall Im pleased to have spent the little extra for this fantastic phone and even happier that I got insurance for it just in case This phone is fast easy to use nicely equipped and is a top notch device Hands down best phone Ive ever had Pictures amazing Speed I give a 10 out of 110 Easy access to apps Edge features very cool Would recommend phone to anyone As a long time android and Samsung user I have to say that as far as performance and fluidity of the phone this is quite a few steps above anything on the current market I currently have a note 5 as well but the expandable memory on the s7 is a huge plus as I tend to be fIll up 32 gbs with my kids photosvideos  games etc I have had every Samsung phone model and this is by far the best one It processes faster has a wifi better connection longer battery life and more storage I have been a huge fan of the Note and Galaxy S series of phones This is one of the best My new Galaxy S7 is easy to use I am very happy with this phone I got this as an early upgrade from my S5 and wow It is a very nice upgrade The camera is greatly improved The phone overall is definitely speedier Love it so far nice phone battery life is great Samsung done it again took something made it bigger but smaller So far so good Better than My 5s Ive only had the phone a short time but I have had no problems All contacts pictures etc transferred over without any issues I enjoy the size of the phone the camera fits my needs and the overall performance is great If there is any negative it would be that the battery life is a little short for a new product I upgraded from an LG and regret it  The Galaxy S7 is less than impressive The screen is smaller than my Note 4 but it is a trade off I am happy to give for the fast processing better signal and better battery life This is by far the best phone I have ever owned I used to be a big time Apple user but recent changes to the company and dealing with Apples annoying limitations inspired me to look elsewhere I check out the S7 Edge before I went to the store and was impressed by a number of the features including the design This phone beats every Apple phone in every category Its bigger faster better picture better sound quality and nonrestrictive What I mean by this is you can actually upgrade a part if something breaks or increase the memory which is huge Running our of memory is usually the first thing that happens with me because of all my apps and business contacts so the fact that I can put another 64 gigs of memory in on top of the 32 gigs I already have blows the 16 gig iPhone out of the water with that feature alone The 4K camera is stellar It does take a little learning but its pretty easy I would recommend this phone to anyone who uses their phones extensively and require a lot of memory and speed Its a great phone for business needs Samsung has the best products period the s7 is the best phone I have ever purchased Great phone upgrade from my S5 that I loved Everything runs amazingly fast It has a crisp user interface TouchWiz is less annoying in fact better than native Google options at this point Samsung even has me enjoying there Web browser over chrome or Firefox I have 2 issues however with the build of the phone physically The speaker is in an annoying spot and easily muffled by how I naturally hold my phone in landscape as well as portrait 1 other issue is the screen glass has a slight bevel to it In itself that is fine but when trying to find a screen protector solution it is HORRIBLE Ive tried a few options and have yet to find a protector that can cover the entire exposed glass edge to edge and not lose sensitivity Hopefully i will find a good fit soon With my s5 having a flat screen it was simple and worked PERFECT Aside from those things the phone is amazing and would still purchase it against the devices available today Overall very very pleased Ive had this phone for almost a month I upgraded from my Note 4 So far it does not disappoint The sleek slim design makes it comfortable to hold The screen brightness adjusts to your current environment which makes it easy on your eyes The speaker clarity is amazing I was at a car show talking to one of the car owners We pulled up a video on my phone and we could hear everything easily even with the surrounding noise The battery life is second to none I can go all day with hardly a battery drain That makes it worth it right there In this day and age where we are all connected to our phones for one reason or another Samsung makes staying connected easy and fun Thank you again Samsung for another fantastic product Ive had an iPhone ever since the 3 came out and switching to this phone has been a beautiful change The 6s is amazing but the Samsung suits me a lot better Its like it was built for adventurous entrepreneurs who still have fashion sense Maybe thats why I have itor maybe because Lil Wayne advertised it Nobody will ever know Special you can watch vidio on it  you can download movies  you can make vidio call  you can make speak sms  self camera WiFi  musics and manymore Love the phone and the great features it has picture taking is fantastic The phone is great No problems with it in the 4 months Ive had it Bought it for a fathers day gift and got a second one as well everyone loves the phone Ease of use and just learnng what all it can do is fun and exciting I have stuck with galaxy phones since I had the S4 and loved it but my favorite feature was the tv remote I had an S6 and loved it but my husband needed a knew phone so we got the buy one get one free deal and I sold my s6 thinking I was getting a better phone The sales person said it was the same only way better I got home and tried to find the remote only to find out it was gone I am so disappointed I will never have another galaxy unless they bring it back Of course I am now stuck with this one for 2 years Dropped phone 1st day Screen is fine but the back shattered This is probably the best phone ive ever owned Fast smart and nice to look at Simply awesome I went from the S5 to S7 and the transition was smooth  There are some neat new features that make some tasks easier The phone app has a better layout and I like that I can see the date and time and notifications with my phone off  Its lighter than my old phone and apps are easier to manage  I am disappointed in that some things seem to load slowly and sometimes not at all vidoes This device  Samsung Galaxy G7 is like having a small portable laptop with a phone attached to it Looks great easy to use I like match needed more memory and speed I have a love hate relationship with cell phones well really I mostly hate them This is the first cell phone Im actually enjoying using It is fast the battery lasts the interface is just like my Samsung tablet so it makes sense to me Best phone Ive ever had Always had good luck with Samsung products S7 is a great phone  Much better than the S5 I had  A bit touchy on the screen and slippery to hold but super video and pics  Very easy to use Very happy I picked this phone Before having my s7 edge I had the s6 edge I really like all the upgrades they did on it That front flash is awesome And the water proofNess is even better because I have two small kids Ive had this phone for nearly a month and it is safe to say that it is the best overall phone on the market today The camera is always consistent the edge features are useful especially for switching applications and the ability to theme with themes and good lock complete the awesome experience I have had this device now for a lil over a month and just absolutely love this device The camera quality is great and it has so many features built in to it that other companys try to brag about like live photos This device is my goto device even over my computer for the speed and smooth operations Will be a permanent samsung loyalist if the company continues to make these great devices better Glad I was able to purchase a new phone Couldnt be happier I really like samsung phonesand this is the best one I have had to date Faster than my S5 Additional storage Much better camera My wife gets a new one soon I hate the phone and dread paying BIG  for the next 2 years This phone has everything you could want in a phone Fast performance with great battery life Im comfotable taking this phone anywhere with me because i know it is build to last I bought this phone two weeks ago and it is terrible  too big  too sensitivetoo many changes I am so pleased with the easy to use features on my new Samsung Galaxy S7 I also like the fact that it charges quickly Plus so many apps to choose  I am truly enjoying this experience I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I am so happy with it I upgraded from the S6 edge for a few reasons that were improved with the S7 Better battery life not sharp to hold in the hand SD card support dual pixel technology for low light pictures did I mention SD card support Thankfully Samsung listened to their customers about the battery life and SD support This phone is EXCELLENT Its fast its reliable great battery life really what more could you ask for It feels great in the hand and in the platinum color looks great in the hand as well The screen is absolutely amazing and crisp the fingerprint scanner is quick to respond and accurate Samsung pay is also a great feature We use the S health app to track our steps the heart rate monitor for exercising and workouts The one thing we REALLY miss is the IR tuner We havent tried the water resistance in them of course not theyre too nice of a phone to dunk in water but I trust they theyd do what they claim Ive always had the Galaxy series phones since the S2 and they have never disappointed us until the S6s poor battery life and lack of SD support Thanks for listening to your customers Samsung Thats why youve been our favorite Got this phone for my wife and have messed around with it as I got the S7 edge instead I must say the S7 is much easier to hold in the hand charges fast and performs excellent Its a very powerful phone with no lagging for us Weve stuck with the galaxy series phones since the S2 They havent let us down yet Thanks Samsung for a superior product I have not had the phone very long So far I like it Still learning get this GSM with it Love the pictures it takes Extremely satisfied We both love our new phones Product is fairly easy to use I have had the phone about a week now So far all is good still learning the new features Much of it is truly good Still i am alittle concerned with battery life I am going to give it a couple more full charges to see if it improves Not happy with this phone  It drops calls all the time  Lose service  Not happy Switched from S4 and there is a huge difference This phone is awesome This phone is great I love the shortcuts that go along with the edge menu Ive owned several Galaxy cell phones Galaxy tablets and phones and tablets by other manufacturers but this one surpassed them all in performance and responsiveness Got 1 week ago and love it Love it still figuring it out though I just upgrade from a S4 to S7 Transition was was easy A lot of features were easy to use Over all I am satisfied with the new S7 My new Samsung Galaxy 7 came in the same size packaged like my 5 with a whole new processor better camera higher speed this phone ultimately is like a miniature computer the ease of access to all the apps in applications is super easy ultimately the phone has pleased me all around Thank you Samsung Customer service was excellent I had just dropped in to see the latest version of my phone Good physical but trouble trying to get some apps to work as easy as before I bought this a week ago and I like it The features I find most interesting about this phone are

1 The emergency 4person voice and picture message feature
2 The level of customization in display settings
3 The different hardware such as fingerprint scanning cameras sensors etc Loved my s3 s4 s5 s6 and now my s7 Works as described I definitely recommend I will always by galany phones Its the perfect size I upgraded from an S3 to the S7 and a lot of changes have been made so Im still getting familiar with the S7  For the most part I think its a much better phone  Its shortcomings to this point may just be my lack of familiarity  The battery life is much better Love my phone Got it a little over a week ago and I have no complaints Fantastic phone Absolutely love it The phone is powerful and sleek the microSD slot is back and I love the fingerprint security and fast charging most I wish Samsungs Smartswitch would have transferred more actual settings and passwordsnot just the apps themselvesbut at least it gets you halfway there It takes a few hours to customize everything to your liking but it rocks once its all set up Upgraded from perfectly fine phone to get advanced calling and Wifi calling waterproofing and design sold me above the others Size is not the huge phablet that most seem to be going to and screen is great
Only downside do far is the lowest part of the screen is a little iffy when selecting things pain as the keyboard lives their Bought 2 the same day one for me and my fiancé hers has been nothing but trouble getting set up the newest update is buggy and at times inconsistent  With the curved screen the new glass coverings do not sit well and the edge of the screen does not respond well and you cannot change the touch sensitivity which needs done with the glass protectors Love my  new phone especially the camera I like the phone and was easy to transition I am still exploring but overall a great pick for me product has a unique design and bright display light weight awesome for business along with other galaxy products In comparison to just a few years back the S7 feels more refined and operates like it should phone is very much like my other phone has better camra but not that much better I should have kept my other phone so much alike updated because I thought batery life would be better and it is worseNot at all happy about thatSometimes people can not hear me when we talk Just got the S7 upgraded from S4  Takes great pictures great phone quality Just need to get used to the new camera features Im very happy with my new phone I got this earlier this month so giving a complete review isnt something I can do right now  It is much quickerresponsive than my last phones I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 for two and a half years and loved it When I needed to upgrade I chose the Galaxy S7 because things can only be improved right Im looking forward to using this phone This is my review what a great product the overall performance is top notch I am a fan of Samsung so I knew I was getting a great product but I am so surprised at the speed and battery life that this phone have Treat yourself to a all in one betterment cell phone Even though its android a lot of the system workings are not the same  I cant even save a text  The processor is much slower watching video is painstaking  It catalogs newest photos to the bottom of the page for some reasonand so on and so on  I want my note back Bought the phone to replace a dying Galaxy S5 The S7 is more powerful and less likely to meet the same tragic fate due to operator error The only draw back to this phone is you get a high level case for it you can find for the Samsung S7 other wise it is awesome much faster than anything else I cant put my personal pics on individual backgrounds like I could with my LG 4 LTE but most other options are compatible Also wishing someone would come up with better sounds for ring tones and alarms Great phone thus far The Samsung Galaxy S7 has impressed me with its performance and the quality and feature of the camera Would recommend to friends and family Less than 2 weeks old  Im sold Coworkers in awe of how versatile  attractive it is Able to navigate with minimal instruction Exceeds my expectations Fast charging on the go I had a window phones for about 4 years Prior to that I had an android Back to the android No complaints Im glad I made the purchase Its easy to use I needed to upgrade and wasnt sure which phone I was going to choose  I am so glad I stuck with the Samsung  I had a S4mini before and didnt want to go to one of the huge phones the Galaxy S7 is a perfect fit for me  Very easy to use and get accustomed to the new features The Samsung Edge S7 is undoubtedly the top smartphone in the world My previous smartphone was a Note 5 and I loved it My wife had an Iphone6s We both switched providers and UPGRADED to the Edge S7we made the right choice This phone is near perfect 
Thanks Samsung I bought the phone about 2 weeks ago and Im getting used to it The battery diminishes pretty quickly which I thought it was better It does take decent photos  My calendar did not transfer from my old phone so that has been a challenge to recreate on my new phone 100 better than what I had before I love this phone It has so many different uses for my personal and business life Easy to use and I always find a new way to do things and the ease of doing different tasks Using voice command makes it faster for me to find contacts websites restaurants directons Love the use of fingerprinting or security coding Samsung has thought of everything to protect my phone and my personal information Just Love how easy it is to manage from websites and the pictures are amazing No pictures at this time Worlds best phone is the way to describe this smartphone It has everything one could ever need Camera is just unbelieveable I recommend this over any other phone 1010 Very nice phone big upgrade from the older models such as the s5 This phone has the 55 inch screen like the 6S but it also has the edge features and also waterproof for 30 minutes at 5 feet No problems so far is light and responsive Bright LED screen with gorilla glass 2 I love everything about it and I will be a good time with my phone I absolutely love this phone right now Ive not even touched 90 of what this phone can do Any games I download after there already downloaded I have to download files once Ive opened the games never had to do that with any other phone my big handsfingers touch edges inadvertently causing to sometimes run other apps that Im not looking to run 

Either I have to hold the phone with an open palm or set down on a surface Ive had this S7 for almost a month now and really regret my upgrade The screens nice and the body is easy to hold otherwise nothing is quite right Not horrible just nothing is particularly intuitive and many of the features get in my way and I spend half my time fixing commands that I didnt intend It gets frustrating  after a while and just hasnt gotten any better I have multiple Samsung devices and this is by far my favorite I upgraded reluctantly from an S5 which never once had a problem and was quick Well this S7 just blows it away I was skeptical of the battery but honestly it has never once died and the quick charging makes up for not having a replaceable battery All in all a great purchase This product is nice and simple to set up and use I enjoy how things it is as well Cant wait to learn more about this device I love this product I like the camera especially Great feautures with it zoom and focus is brilliant Still learning more about it but what i have used for features is fasinating I also love the S Health app on the phone Tracks your steps workouts and food you eat I also love how the phone has the ability to use fingerprint security it comes in handy instead of having to type passcode The only down fall to the phone it self is if you dont have a case on it the chances of a crack in the phone is extremely high They arent so durable with physical damage I was very excited about getting this phone and wow what a disappointment My last smart phone was hands down better Battery life is poor and it has less features Do your homework before you but this Great design look feel features and hardware
I like that SD is back and water resistant Only had the phone a weekHappy the features are almost the same I intended to keep my Samsung Galaxy S111 as long as it worked Unfortunately the battery stopped holding a charge for very long so I replaced it with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Big difference
My new phone has so may new features I like being able to keep track of my heart rate while exercising and keeping track of how many steps I take each day
I am able to keep track of my calorie intake and how many calories I burn This will be a big help to me in my weight loss attempt
The visual voicemail is a nice feature and I like the always on feature so I can always see the time 
My phone also has a very good camera
Another good feature is that it is water resistant
Actually after seeing and using the new features I am happy I had to get a new phone
I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 I bought the phone 2 weeks ago and in general its nice but too many new bells and whistles We are currently having issues with Bluetooth with my wifes hearing aid Streamer and the car Blue tooth we had a Samsung S3 before and never really had any issues I really enjoy the new S7 Its a nice design and out of the box it runs extremely well I upgraded from the S5 and so far the S7 is a great phone I would recommend this phone The S7 is the best phone Ive ever had I highly recommendrecommend Always a top notch product have had nothing but galaxiws since they have been out Just got it and am still learning how to use it Best galaxy phone yet I have owned a lot of Samsung products and they have all been excellent I have been an android user for about 5 years I traded in my almost 2 year old fading Note 4 for this phone and so far it has been a great upgrade It is noticeably smoother and faster The screen size is arguably perfect and for your average adult and it has a very premium feel without seeming too delicate Coming from a noncurved smartphone the edges do require some getting used to although they are pretty cool and more useful than I had previously thought The size and the curve definitely suggests that this phone is for the more tech savvy user although Samsung does a good job of making it accessible to the masses 

Very easy phone to pick up if youre not used to or are scared of making the switch to Android Ive had the S7 for a couple weeks now Ive always been a Samsung fan but I love the S7 Would recommend it to anyone who uses droids I have had no problems and it is so much better than my S5 I have tried to keep the S7 working like my S4 but I am glad for the extra storage because that was my biggest problem with the S4 Had it a couple weeks and love it Got the new s7 I had the s4 and I love it Great battery life Super fast and great camera It has great storage for all my apps and is so easy to use I love my new phone The galaxy products are so good I just updated from a 4year old phone which was out of memory This is much faster and works well I just wish it was smaller and used less battery power One thing I dont like about this phone is the battery Itll lose battery life if Im not using it I like how I can personalize pretty much anything on here I also wish that it had its own music player Theres plenty to choose from I just wish I knew if there was an official one After googling it it doesnt seem there is an official and you can download any one you want I got my old phone wetand I had a upgrade dueReally like this new phone much better 1st android phone superbly impressed seems I waited to long to switch from apple platform Amazing Everything about this device works great Super fast and reliable Finally a truly beautiful Samsung device Great camera and i love my gear 360 camera and vr headset

I wish it had a purer android experience though The best device Ive purchased up to now Ive always been an android user and wouldnt change it for anything else I miss the IR for controlling my TV other than that really nice phone Great phone Havent tried out the water proof feature yet I wish I could get better service  I miss calls and texts Great phone fantastic coverage I recently switched from an iPhone and have had iPhones ever since their debut and this is completely different Pretty difficult to learn but the screen is noticeably nicer and clearer than an iPhone Ive only had it a couple of weeks and havent had time to really dig into all of the features so Im hoping once I do Ill feel better about the switch Wont hold a charge thats why I got rid of the last one Happy i upgraded Galaxy S7 phone has everything you needwantissue is in deciding what to use and what to block or inactivate
Speed of phone opns is excellent I didnt want to spend this much  but so glad I did I loved my Galaxy S4 but traded up to the S7 and wonder why I waited so long Every day Im finding something new to love about my phone discovering new features and how they work and Im honestly at the point where Im wondering how I got by without it This phone is lightweight user friendly takes amazing pictures and has great sound Definitely take a look I think youll be happy you did This is a work phone and I upgraded from an S5 

I dont see a bunch different from the S5 Battery life is better screen is clear Camera is a lot better but over all its pretty much the same phone as my old S5

I am glad I got it but was expecting more from a 2 phone version jump 

Over all it is very nice and worth picking up if your current phone is giving you issues i bought the last week because I thought i lost my old phone but I was going to up grade this week any way I bought the next Galaxy and it seems very similarge to the last The one improvement Ive noticed is the battery It will last all day plus have a good amount left I like pretty much everything about this phone except for SVoice which is Samsungs version of Motorolas Moto Voice and OK Google Half the time it wont recognize my voice and even when it does the info isnt very useful I switched to OK Google after a few frustrating days Moto Voice is excellent and something I really miss about my Droid

Multiple emoji sets Samsung Verizon make it impossible to choose emojis in text messages because theyre always different In Verizons messaging app the keyboard shows one emoji but what gets put in the text message looks completely different Drain too fast the battery I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Its amazing Try it Very dependable user friendly Im in construction it is very durable Just bought phone Appears to be what I wanted Great phone just have to get used to the smaller screen especially when watching Netflix or Hulu on it but convenient that I can put in my pocket without a huge bulge Absolutely love this phone I have not found anything about it that I dont like Im so happy and love my phone Easy to use Great battery life The galaxy s7 has been everything I could hope it would be and more Never any delays waiting on it to process anything Having multiple windows open at once has come in handy many times Only down side is that the soft keys are in a location where they are inadvertently touched rather often I upgraded from an S3 to the new S7 this phone is AMAZING
The picture quality the sound quality cant be met with any other phone
The low light camera is amazing Great functionality I do not have any type of issue with the battery time I can be on the phone most of the day using video and sound functions and the battery easily lasts with room to spare good screen  price way too much  poor reception  Side by side with my old S3 and the older technology gets 4 bars and new phone gets 1 There arent enough great things to say about this phone but its by far the fastest most innovative and prettiest headset to date The only drawbacks from what Ive seen comes to texting and the phone runs a little warm during moderate use Typing near the edges of the screen can be difficult when registering certain characters too I recommend turning off the Edge Screen functions or activating the SingleHand option to remedy this to some degree but it by no means disparaging a great phone packed with useful features Got this a couple of week ago and am happy with the move I was worried this would be a hard move after having an IPhone for 5 years but it wasnt bad at all The day my wife and I purchased the phones  we tried out video meaning we can see each other on the phone as we speak  the S7 is amazing phone I had the S4 and my wife had the S4 mini and let me tell you much better the camera take awesome pictures the only thing I dont like is when they installed the glass part to put over the glass itself  to protect the screen is too short does not cover the sides too well Thank you So much more than I expected  
I couldnt be more pleased Upgraded my phone to the S7 So far its everything Ive expected Features are great and theres more memory so Im already on the plus side Great phone Easy to use and very clear screen and pictures  The camera works great  Much better phone that my previous Motorola  I did buy a cover since the phone is very slick  I didnt want to risk breaking since it is very expensive  However the gorilla glass is supposed to protect it  you cant be too careful with a  phone So far so good Phone is great size Easier to use than the s4 was Still getting use to it So happy I upgraded from an S3 Im pretty stoked about the Galaxy S7 so far The screen and images are bright and crisp Its very user friendly and Samsungs products just keep getting better Ive been a Samsung phone customer for awhile I may branch off to their other products Takes amazing pictures and Im very pleased with how much faster the phone is overall I like the fingerprint reader and the fact that its water resistant  Other than those features and faster processor it hasnt added much value over my previous phone  I miss a few features from my previous phone but Im finding apps to compensate

If youre looking for a solid flagship phone this is it Ive had the last few versions of the Galaxy and this one takes the cake I love its style and ease of use My wife has the iPhone 6 Plus and is totally jealous of the edge Samsung keeps getting better Ive had every Samsung Galaxy phone since the beginning and ill keep on getting them not to include their watches tooall Samsung products are awesomes7 the best phone yet especially paired with the gear s2 Just purchased but so far very user friendly and easy to navigate I just recently purchased this phone and cant give a longevity review but I can say this phone far exceeded any expectations I had before I purchased it It has been an easy transition from my previous phone I was able to get the gold color With the wall paper available on the phone itself it makes for a nice appearance Am pleased with the battery performance texting callingYouTube The battery really does charge fast as advertised The screen and audio are also very well put together I am very glad I made this investment  Ive had iphones I have had lgs and nothing compares to the Galaxy s7 it is the very best by far  I just returned from New Zealand and Australia receiving the phone as a delayed Christmas gift two days before the trip and it took wonderful photos The low light feature is amazing and even took photos in a long tunnel in New Zealand
I have lots to learn about the Galaxy S7 but so far I am very impressed

My previous phone was a Samsung Note 2 many improvements

The additional storage is an added bonus I bought this phone last week and I love it I upgraded to s7 after my previous one gave I wished there was a manual that came with it cuz still struggling with going around it Worst phone ever wish I wouldve kept my other phone Love the new S7 so many cool features3d pictures and so many other cool things Im happy overall with the s7 the 1 issue I have is not being able to use voice dialing while the phone is locked without unlocking it first The Samsung pay app is great works way better and in way more places the apple pay Ive had it freeze up once but got it back  My fingerprint ID didnt work well so I removed it  the protective cover on the front doesnt cover the whole screen like my 4S did  Id like it to cover all so stuff doesnt get in between Great phone thus far I think I made a good choice with giving the galaxy 7 a try Havent had any problems with the phone Love this phone Love the new cloud feature however it does fill up fast Only reason for a 4  star review was the battery life isnt what I thought that would be I bought this a week ago  Get phone but Im getting pop up ads Good stuff on this phone I have had this phone a week now and Im loving it I had the Galaxy S6 and thought i had the Best Now I know I have the Best Easy to use and Smart I Love it So glad I was able to get this new phone so quickly Its almost the same but I can see the difference and its Great Longer battery life than S6  I like the always on time and date display Love this phone and its features My first Smart Phone  Easier than I expected to operate  Still have much to learn great up grade from the 5s  Doing things I never did with a phone the 7s makes it so easy The only think that I dont know if I like is the Alarm clock It doesnt shut off after a minute and go to snoozeit stays on the whole time Wish there was a way to change that setting Other than that its a  GREAT PHONE Liked it from the start Had a Galaxy S2 for six years I finally had to upgrade because the phone was running out of memory Purchased the Galaxy S7 and happy with it so far My only concern is the battery isnt removable and when it goes how much it will cost to replace The Galaxy S2 battery was easy to replace Rocky start at first with this purchase  Could not use it for the first week or so but now I am very pleased to keep it  Its faster  no down time send and receive messages faster clearer screen better apps that work better  All around better phone So happy that I got the s7 This is probably the number 1 most useful phone besides the edge I have always enjoyed any samsung products that I have owned They are reliable and easy to work with Have had this phone for a week the charge on the battery may last 6 hours if you dont use it much more than half the time when I get a call I cant here the person on the other end or they cant here me I bought this a few weeks ago and immediately more happy with it than any of my previous smart phones which were all apple products I absolutely LOVE the Galaxy S7 edge The new features and design is amazing I bought these phones and tablets about 2 weeks ago  My s7 is glitch ingredients a bit the speaker makes music and callers sound different  My daughters tablet wouldnt charge past 1 I like the size  design of the phone performance is excellent only issue is battery life requires close monitoring of use of phone I had a galaxie s3 prior to this s7  that phone worked better I get no signal at work my side shop  my cabin in poconos My friends tmobile phone works great Best phone Ive had yet Very happy with my purchase This is a great phone  I love the wireless charging  The battery life is really nice  It gets me through a full day and more  Highly recommended It is much better than the LG I had before Better battery life and speed  Easier to handle in my small hands I was ready for a new phone and the timing was perfect It really feels like I can do a lot more The galaxy S7 is a vast improvement from the S4  The camera takes awesome pictures the battery lasts twice as long and the display is bright and crisp  I love that it is water resistant I switched to this phone a little under a month ago I love it Its battery lasts me all day even when it says its about to die Its super fast and has run very smooth the entire time The camera is fantastic It works as well as my actual camera Sky pictures even turn out great I can hear people easily during phone calls and they can hear me There are a ton of great features I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone in the market for a new one  This is a big step from the previous Samsung Galaxy it has a lot of new features and very slick design I love it I have only had this product two days so I dont have a lot to say about it Its been running smoothly and I havent run into any glitches yet I am still learning the features on the phone but like what I see so far I finally broke down and switched from the iphone and I am in love with this Samsung I didnt even realize all the features when I got it I use the health app all the time to track my steps the coach to do little workouts Im a busy lady those little workouts are awesome The only downside is the price That was crazy expensive for a phone Is it proportionally better than the others Yes Are they all ridiculously overpriced Yes Easy to use great photo and video crisp and easy to read everything on it This phone has not only impressed me but all of my friends And with all of the Samsung gear you can hook up to the options are endless excellent performance way better than iPhone 6S and other phones Only had this for 3 weeks  but what an impressive phone  coming from an s6 and Im  still impressed  The one phone that finally has it all  water proof  SD card 4gb
Ram and the camera man  the camera is unbelievable Well done Samsung I have no interest in the fruit phones in the least anymore These android phones are freedom I like the design and storage capacity I just wish there was a smaller version of this particular phone Works well for all my applications but it can get annoying carrying with me while performing some of my out door tasks

Definitely would still get another one My wife has an IPHONE and its amazing how much better this is than that product Samsung and Droid have come a long way

Samsung user for life Easy to navigate Easy to read text and looks great The thing i like most about this phone is the camera quality I dropped my phone in the case it popped out and the screen cracked I would never buy the edge again Amazing phone when you can hold it and not push extra buttons Best phone out there in my opinion It seems like Samsung is setting us up to fail by making this phone Its way too thin and slick Theres nothing to hold on to so of course youre going to drop it If you simply have to have this phone cant live without it make sure and get a case for it immediately and make it a strong one because this phone is made out of glass front and back So the first time you drop it without the case it shatters the whole phone not just the glass screen but the back of it also Even if it does still work there goes your waterproof I would recommend getting a different phone Far better controlling changing from one task to another than my S4 and split screen is far easier whether doing it on a regular or edge version This is my first samsung smartphone and my experience has been great I get long on screen hoursbattery life the screen is very clear vibrant and I can see it very well out on the sunlight I can use samsung pay it charges quickly holds a good signal 

 The edge feature is nice to have for quick access to news contacts and some apps while multitasking and it can display a clock on the edge during the night for a quick view of what the time is 

 This phone is also very smooth I havent had any lag or performance issues Imo this is one of the best phones you could buy right now and I dont regret it at all I bought this phone a few weeks ago now I still wonder why I didnt take it back and get a Motorola droid TURBO   I used to really like Samsung but after 4 years with Motorola phones lastly the Maxx and turbo models which I still have and use in my work  I find my Motorola is easier to use probably because Im used to it Then also the battery life in my Motorola is longer it charges faster and is not so slippery to hold on to and gets better service  Id say the Motorola turbo is more of a working mans phone than the Galaxy s7 Very glad I bought this Phone transition was smooth and the features of the S7 are very satisfactory Brighter screen and new generation camera are plusses being able to read screen outdoors is great I purchased this after being disgusted with my long time association with another company This 
product is awesome I love it It is fun exciting enjoyable and I am always surprised at the versatility
of this superb device I highly recommend this to new users and experienced users You will be most happy you made the choice So far I have only had a few issues I like the sleek design I like the themes feature but it can really make things hard to find or unrecognizable

Water resistant feature was issue when I was in shallow ocean because the phone would act like I pushed buttons everytime water touched the screen maybe I can change the sensitivity of touch settings Not sure I had trouble charging it even after I was sure that it had dried out I even tried blow dryer still wouldnt work said moisture in the charging port Eventually I soaked the phone again and washed out the charger port with fresh water I dried it out once again with hairdryer on mid setting The phone finally started charging again but it has been acting slow on some buttons now Hum Didnt get phone even under 1 foot of water 

The VR aspects are amazing and I bought this phone after playing on my friends S7 edge with Oculus Rift The edge is hard to get cases for and it is a little too responsive on the edge I have hard time not clicking wrong things 

I am not fond of the button functions on this S7 I would like to know if those can be reassigned or customized The home button and the button left of it kind of lagging now and their function isnt what Im used to

The photos are outstanding and I must say that hands down this is why I buy Samsung I want 3 more features though even more control over shutter speeds Samsung pro version attachments to make my photography zooms clearer even more mega pixel power and more professional features I want to replace all my other cameras or at least most

The selfie wave to take photos is awesome The 3d spinning around objects is phenomenal I love the new levels this provides to an artistic mind The Samsung S7 Edge is everything a phone should be The ease of use is outstanding Menus are simple to navigate and the whole user interface is a joy to work with I like it  a lot  to got 2 This is my second Samsung phone but my husband and I also have two Samsung tablets a Samsung TV and a Samsung desktop computer You might say we like Samsung The big reason why we have chosen all of these items is because we can share everything between each and every one This makes things so much easier as we dont have to learn a different application for all of our products I really like the camera on my new S7 Its even better than what I was used to on my previous Samsung phone My only minor dislike is in the design  mainly where the onoffvolume controls are located I am a small person with small hands and its a bit difficult to operate without bumping the wrong button But I still love it First off I upgraded from an S4 I was expecting major improvements but the only thing that is better is the camera The battery life is a joke Not even doing anything and it goes low fast The antenna is also not as good as I have way more complaints about this phone than my S4 I appreciate having the new selfie option 2 just touch the heart monitor We also like the double click on the home key and it goes right to the camera settings that is a great feature for catching the grandchildren in the act
We do miss the hover feature that was available on the Galaxy S5 it is missing on the Galaxy S7 Ive just purchased my 3rd galaxy phone I have been using these phones for the last 5 years and really like the operating system I have passed my last 2 phones on to my childrenand theyre all still in use
Today the transfer of info from my old phone to my new one was amazingly easy

I highly recommend the Galaxy line Replaced  my old Motorola RazorMaxx with the S7 Have a Samsung tablet so the transition was easy  Its a little bigger but so thin that you dont notice Discharges faster but running a lot more apps Overall a great phone Pros are the design appearance and performance Cons are the camera and ironically for me because I have big hands that wrap around and makes contact with the edges Or holding in my palm with my fingers open which makes dropping a concern Ultimately I purchased a covertakes away from the clean appearance I would still recommend this phone Everything on this device is fast Keep in mind that this is a handheld computer that happens to have a very cool phone included in it Incredible photos even in low light and at night Awesome video for recording or streaming while on a call This is a device anyone should be very pleased to own Love the galaxys this one is even better Only one thing I would change is the battery overheating which hasnt happened on this one but it has my Gold S7 would definitely recommend this phone to anyone LIKE THAT THE MEMORY IS EXPANDABLE AND THE COLOR OD THE SCREENAND EASY OF TAKING SCREEN SHOTS AND WIRELESS CHARGING what can I say that would be different from anyone else Nothing that I can think of comes to mind Great style great function and water resistant to boot I dont know how they can improve on this phone but I am sure Samsung will will find a way to get more of my money All I can say is that it is well worth it I bought this Galxy7S about  month ago and Im still getting to know it I had an iPhone and they sure are different but I like a lot of the features on the 7S but I miss a few from my old phone But I am happy with the Galaxy 7S Not durable like hTC M9 that was fell off my truck and been run over traffic cars glass was scattered but it work flawless About year and half ago I ended up getting a Galaxy Tab3 for my birthday present I started falling in love with it LoL The sound and the great picture it had but I really like the interface and the way the SD card works and the drop down quick settings So now Ive had my Galaxy S7 edge for about 4weeks and this phone is so amazing I havent found 1 thing that I would have changed if I were to build a phone from scratch And Im a picky person with anything electronic Its a super sweet phone Im enjoying my graded Galaxy S7 phone the features are great I like the smaller size it is easier for me to manage Never fun going to a smaller screen but anything can be zoomed in so the trade off was worth it Samsung is an easy system to get used to I am antiApple so the iPhone was not an option The S7 has been a great daily driver The display is amazing and it has great battery life I just got it 2 weeks ago and love my phone and versions service I couldnt be happier Itd just awesome and smooth Ive had it for a month and ive hade no problems and excellent service fast and now with memory upgradable Love the phone I miss the screen size stylus and brightness of Note 3   The Samsung to Samsung transfer did not work as indicated everything did not transfer I love my new phone its great I recommend to all 2 get one Overall I like this phone changes I would make removable battery  larger screen and longer battery life especially since I cant change to another one I bought this a week ago after my son broke my S5 and glad I did Takes amazing photos Battery lasts way longer than my S5 The phone came with the extra accessory of an external charger yay  
I also submitted the form to receive the free VR Gear 68 weeks before delivery
Really fast access to Google and the Camera for frontrear view shots a plus

Only complaints are  
1 My email inbox no longer shows ALL items ie some emails that are new but dated last month and some that are old but I kept for reference
2 I dont use my phone a lot but still have to charge the battery every 1 to 112 days Only gave the performance 4 stars because that might be and issue for heavyusers who would have to charge more often I was reluctant to switch from iPhone to Samsung but I am so glad I did It was easy to learn the system and the screen is so much bigger and easier to read The camera is the best Im still learning some of the fine points of the phone but it is fun and a great adventure The special characters location changed with this keyboards layout and I cant choose a keyboard layout that fixes this issue But the tablet I bought at the same time has the original layout Just a pain Got it a week ago love it Upgraded phone love the features S7 EDGE is an amazing phone i like the design and features
Unfortunately it god few dead pixels and after a week there was a pink across the edge

and then i got replacement a used phone which is really not a good sign i handle my phone with extra care so it was in great condition the one which i get look just good scratch in camera and charging port looks bad

Option to sych with keyless entry cars so phone can be used as Key with a passcode I want to love this phone but still havent felt it It has some new features that are pretty cool especially the waterproof protection The screen is cool but I still cant find a case that gives decent peace of mind and allows you to use all the edge features I love the Samsung apps and features over my last phone the LG G4 However I loved my previous Galaxy S4 and miss several things now missing on the Edge Why no HDMI out I am hoping this phone grows on me so I feel the love but for now I only like it This phone is the best Ive had It out performs any phone I had in the last 7 years Everything is so easy to use and the operation is so natural Doesnt run add smooth as my old S4 Likes to look up trying to get in it sometimes I purchased the S7 a few weeks ago and just love it Its fast and has an awesome battery life It comes with a lighting charger for really quick charge I love the sleek design and great camera Picture quality is outstanding I also enjoy all the reminder features my other phone didn t offer I am now on time and up to date It is light weight and with my new case it is easy to find d in my purse changed from another service provider and am getting great customer support It was so easy to upgrade from an S4 and the new features and OS make me feel like a kid in a candy store The longer battery life and rapid charging are must haves for any busy lifestyle Without a doubt this has to be one of the best if not solely the best Samsung Pay works fantastic great sound fantastic features Very powerful  takes a little getting used to Glad I bought this Very easy to usefriendly apps Okay I like it the phone is just what I need for work and hoemail Great phone  beautiful design long battery life always performing at the highest level highly recommend Very durable and lightweight Many different options to really customize and make it your own Love the color almost like a gold silver color Great product from a great company Samsung is the best brand phone you can get The S7 is very fast and can handle many things open at once with its efficient processor Just what I was looking for when I was shopping for a phone Great product I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 about a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it and its features  Everything is where it should be  Unlike most other phones Samsung has maintained the physical button  Which is something I like  The screen size is great and extremely clear  

I only have one issue  The audio has a slight buzz but hopefully this will be corrected by the warranty Bought the S7 about 10 days ago upgrade from S5 Love it Well so far it is an excellent device Charger works very quickly Screen looks and feels great Finger print was not to bad to setup Battery life has really done its job so far Still getting to know all its features and truly customize it for myself The only thing that I have encountered negative is 10 gigs of the 32 gig storage is used already That is crazy Other than that we will see 

Ps I will write another review Enjoying all my phones  features Ive had the s3 s5 and now the s7 and the s7 is by far the best Great phone easy to use features like the great quality pictures it takes great sound quality etc great phone I love this phone is recommend this phone to everyone friends family I got my computer worker to switch from iPhone 6 to this phone My boyfriend also has the note 4 hes upgrade is coming he is also going to get this phone
I recommend this phone to everyone  Similar enough to the older version to avoid a complete learning curve nightmare as trying to get used to new phone Now I see what all the hype is about No hype All true Good transition from s4 just took some time to find things I used a lot but they were there just had to search menus I do love this phone everything about its features But the hardware is the breakerand thats literal Ive broken 2 in 2 weeks I thought this was a more durable screen but I was horribly wrong Only disappointmentbut its a big one 
Its no Note The overall glass is a little frustrating bc it forces me to cover it with a case and hide the sleek design I also HATE all the required Samsung and Verizon apps that I cant erase The texting app isnt as good as Swype which I used on my galaxy s4 I really like all the updates to the functionality of the apps Such as the way you can minimize screens and rearrange them The widgets that are offered are cheap and not worth using unlike the ones that came with my s4 The battery lasts 2 days without a charge and I cant complain about the rapid charge when the phone is turned off I get a full charge 10 to 100 in less than 2 hours Had it less than a month Takes great photos Amazing phone beyond my expectations truly the best phone This phone is easy to use I love the fingerprint unlock feature Now my teens cant sneak off with my phone I love this phone Its Awesome I would totally recommend it to a friend I am really looking forward to purchasing more Samsung Gear such as the Samsung Gear S2 the Samsung Gear VR etc Thank you Samsung SO much for this Plus its WATERPROOF This phone is easier to work than iPhone  Battery life is longer and charges faster Apps are great I wouldnt trade for nothing Samsung is the best Samsung has listened to the consumers Great phone Best Samsung yet Only thing I miss is the IR blaster but I can cope without it Awesome phone its just there are a few things I dont like about it like how you cant delete apps by holding onto the app icon I love my new phone I only have one issue and that is the wifi option I have used a lot of my data because the wifi doesnt automatically connect  I have much to learn Had trouble with two Motorola phones do not have any trouble with this phone Total garbage
Worst phone ever
Battery has to charge 2 times a day Note I do not play games or use many apps
The back of the phone has a glass cover GLASS not metal FRAGILE
This broke on day number 4 of owning it from a very small drop to my desk
I purchased a expensive screen protector from the brick and mortar store that sells this had it installed it is not the right size makes it look terrible
I can not return it from the crack in the glass or I would have been back
STAY AWAY I use my Samsung for my part time job as a lyft driver the screen is large and clear enough to see
operations without any problems Listening to music and playing games are easy to accomplish with the operating systems that it is equipped with Altogether it is great product Thank You I love the design and features of the phone The clock feature when the phone is off saves battery by alot The edge screen is an easy and faster way to get to another page I love the split screen You can have two qpps open at once The body design is my favorite Its unigue and gives the phone a good look Lighting quick with great features and a relatively simple operating system I dont have the edge but my partner does and the tactile features on it seems terrible in comparison A great phone overall much better than the iPhone 4s I was using My phone gets really hot sometimes I like most of the features except when my phones to hot to use Sometimes I cant even use it to talk on I just switched from another smart phone that was a bit less than user friendly Love the ease I can navigate Upgraded from s5 S5 was great this one is faster with better cameraawesome The phone and apps are awesome  Love the camera capabilities and the S Health app is great  Just make sure that Verizon ensures that your new Galaxy S7 can also function on the 1X towers  4GLTE coverage has been spotty at best even in metro Charleston Great product works well and Id suggest anybody looking for a new phone to try the S7 it even has expandable memory This is my first phone in a real long time  I usually use my Note or laptop  Still getting used to everything it can do Ive only had it for a week but Im loving it so far The battery is lasting longer than expected The camera has excellent resolution I bought my phone 3 weeks ago and I love it so much that idk why I didnt sooner Its ok nothing different to me than the s5 I who This Samsung is amazing Everything about it is perfect its easy to use and very intuitive If deciding between the s7 or the edge Treat yourself to the edge No con plants Getting a bigger screen is just one of the many advantages The edge panel makes the quick use and function on apps messaging and call ingredients so much better Having the power to swipe the edge of your phone to bring up contacts to call message or video call is amazing Plus has edge pages to swipe through allowing you to add app shortcuts to less clutter your home screen Ad the weather alarm and even sports Edge is speed and reaction to the key bored and screen is amazing Dont think could get any more efficient Maybe be a little extra buck but worth every penny Great features comfortable and powerful design Love this phone I purchased my new Galaxy S7 2 weeks ago over the Iphone 7 I knew that no matter which phone I got Id be getting the best of the best out today Through further use of the phone Ive found that the Galaxy S7 is THE best phone out right now Beware I have had nothing but one problem after another The phone randomly restarts throughout the day oh wait this is just the beginning then it started getting extremely hot oh wait I had to turn off fast charging so the phone didnt melt down Now the speaker has completely stopped working did a factory reset and 12 other things I havent dropped this phone nor have I gotten it wet For the price of this device I shouldnt have to fill out a warranty claim to get it fixed it should work out of the box Samsung has won me overI love my new phone It is the masterpiece of all cell phones currently available  This is hands down the best Samsung galaxy device that i have owned This is an amazing phone The operating system is very fastswitching between apps and running multiple programs simultaneously is no problem The screen is beautiful and the edge functionality is way more useful than I had originally expected Call quality is crystal clear so much so that Ive had people on the other end of the line comment on how clean I sound on their end Battery life is great even with heavy usage Would definitely recommend to anyone Adjusting to new phone was easier than anticipated I thought I liked iPhones more but after getting familiar with the galaxy s7 Id say this is the phone to go with It has better features in my opinion This is an Android which is Google  I have had my problems with Android and my last phone was a Galaxie S 5  I am already having some of the same problems with this new S7  My S 5 had some real problems not sure whether it was the electronics or the software no one could seem to tell me  This one is much better but a few of the little issues are still there I traded in my Galaxy S3 because it was heavy and cumbersome with an extended battery I am delightfully surprised by my new Galaxy S7 Light bright efficient great sound great WiFi and all the other good adjectives Had phone two weeks and now sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesnt when I am getting a call or message I dont know if I would recommend it yet I just got this phone a week ago and have been discovering all sorts of things to do with it that I wasnt able to do with my other phone Awesome phone so far Love the new features I went from s5 to s7 Love it Awesome phone in all things Went from an S5 to the S7  Easy transition and with much better battery life  Am very pleased Dont like that Alarm names are limited to 20 characters  My old S3 allowed many more characters for Alarm names  Also miss the functionality of the button to the left of the Main button I switched from a different brand of phone and was very happy the transition wasnt hard at all Im very happy with my decision My previous phone was the Galaxy S5 and although the phone worked great I started to lose interest fast My fiance has the iPhone S6 Edge and that thing is great However I decided to trust Samsung and give the 7 a try and it is amazing The feel in my hands and the look of the phone is unmatched I really love the features that come with it such as the manipulation of the camera the always on mode etc I would definitely recommend this phone Bought it a week ago Very pleased I started with a conpetetors phone and I liked the phone When I went to get a new phone my eyes were getting bad and I couldnt see as well the display on that phone was tiny for my eyes so I decided to get a Samsung 3 Brand new and I loved it I loved it so much that when the first Samsung 3 quit working after about 4 or 5 years I purchased a new Samsung 3 from the internet That one didnt last as long I still used the phone for about 2 years but I still love the phone I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 80 I have had that for 3 years and it is used non stop I had bought a Windows phone for my husband and he used it for 3 years and hated that phone hated it So I told him this year I would get him a new phone I opted to get him The New Samsung Galaxy 7 and at the very last moment of purchasing his phone I decided to get one for me as well We have had these phones since April my husband keeps ranting at how much he likes this phone He isnt much of the person to use his phone much but what he does do on his phone is perfect fit for him And as for how much I like my phoneI love it I had had my new phone for about a month when I went to get a pedicure My first one ever and my Samsung Galaxy 7 fell into the warm water that my feet were soaking inOh my gosh to my surpriseMy phone was perfectly fine after drying it off and checking everything out and that has been about a month ago that that happened and I still am having absolutely no problems with my phone Top performance take all concerns of the S6 address them and produce the revised product and you have the S7 longer battery life expandable storage water resistance better than iPhone camera fantastic display and wireless charging More than enough to keep you studying ways to utilize all of its capabilities I really like this new design of the phone Its ergonomic in the hand The buttons are in the right places Very slick smooth design and not crowded with a lot of nonessential apps at all Love the wireless charging feature Battery is not what I expected but does have 2 levels of saving battery power The battery got better with the 3rd update Pretty much everything I would want in in a smart phone I love this phone  It took a little time to learn it and to customize it but I love it  Pictures are so vivid and it is so fast  Glad I got it I had this phone less than 2 weeks with a case with a glass screen protector on it verizon had NO lifeproof cases  the screen now has several dents in it cracks the quality of the construction is horrible  Its only 2 months old  I cant imagine that its going to last 2 years  its fragile I bought it so that it could withstand water and to replace the note 4 that got water logged but given how much it does not handle dry land i have no hopes that it will withstand water as it claims  

basically if you dont take it outside keep the phone inside of a bubble dont press to hard on it never drop it dont touch the screen with anything or use it too much then its a fine phone  Other than that  buy something more durable  if you actually want to use it  have it last for 2 years

VERY DISAPPOINTED in this purchase I love the Edge The pros Good battery life ease of use great camera aesthetically pleasing

The cons videos pixelate when sent via SMS the edge notifications when the phone is locked is a bit volatile some times it works other times not the google voice function to make calls from a locked screen is random sometimes it works most times it doesnt and constantly having to retrain google to my voice is annoying

Overall the phone is a good buy and I recommend  I recently upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S6 I was going to wait until the newer models came out but Im glad I upgraded Significant step up from the S6 Camera quality is outstanding speed and performance is a step up and so is the color quality I am extremely happy that I chose to upgrade I have no cons that I can speak of about this phone for now I got this phone almost two weeks ago and I love it Samsung is the best Has all the best products Wouldnt dare to use any other brand Overall i prefer my s4 over this one Overall sound quality is worse I had the S5 before and it was a very easy transition It functions about the same with some fun extra features This product is working great and would recommend My Samsung 7 is fast and easy to use Love it It a computer in the palm of my hand This is by far the best phone that I have ever owned 
I am so happy with all the excellent features and perfect performance It is a superb device for anyone that wants a flawless durable and easy to use smart phone with impeccable quality and luxury design All expectations are met This is surely going to be everyones new best friend You cant help falling in love with the new Samsung Galaxy S7 The features are intuitive and very user friendly I have owned the S series from the S3 to now the S7 Each one keeps getting better I am and have recommended this phone to my friends and family The initial setup is so easy Transferring your apps pix flix and music is as easy as can be I have looked at other phones but still come back to Samsung Im hooked At the very least check it out Great phone the only problem I have is that it keeps rebooting by itself I have experienced the following problems that I have not had with my S3 the phone I previously had to this one  I have had dropped calls in locations that I never had problems before calling the same people I talked with from the same location  Also I had a bit of a problem syncing the phone with Sync but finally got it done  I have had many occasions where while driving the phone loses its connection with SYNC
Other than those issues I find the phone fast pictures good and the display is outstanding Last week I upgraded my phone from the Galaxy S5 to the new S7  Im not seeing much improvement though I have to say that made transition very easy  The socalled fast charger thats supposed to take 30 minutes takes over an hour  One reason I wanted to upgrade was the battery on my S5 was fading  I still have to charge every day with the new phone  No improvement so there was no real reason to upgrade Ive been with Verizon for less than a month I like your service Just bought traded in my Galaxy S5 it was time love this new phone Takes great pictures Love the new style great upgrade Got locked out of my own phone on 2nd day but by no fault of mine Have to send back to factory on 3rd day This phone is not user friendly at all emails dont so images unless I load more and then I have to click show images to see them To return a missed call I have to touch 3 commands before the call is made I was text an address today and had to copy  paste it to maps before it would show location When sending text I type the 1st letter of the name of the person and get a list of every name in my contact list that has that letter in any part of it not the names that begin with that 1 letter The font in maps is to small especially interstate  highways no matter how much you zoom in those never get any bigger I could go on and on glad I have an 13 day trial period its going back tomorrow S7 easy to use and the camera is amazing Wanted to get a small tablet at home and upgrading to this device was a cinch I purchased this phone throw version and it has been one of the best phones I have ever used The freedom you have to customize the format and add a background photo on your messages is amazing I have recommended this phones to my coworkers and my wife Still learning all the features this phone has it all The design of the Galaxy S7 is a greater look and feel for a phone I love the performance of the phone The slick look of the Galaxy S7 puts the IPhone to shame I love this phone Would get another Best phone I have had We only have Samsung in our house This phone has exceeded all of my expectations I wasnt looking for a new phone I was forced to buy one when my old phone broke The S7 is easy to use the Samsung apps especially the Health app is useful And Im pleasantly surprised at the Galaxy Gear devices work with it The free Gear VR is amazing Transition from my Galaxy S5 was not too smooth  Lost pictures some apps  Battery seems to run down quickly I only have the phone for two weeks Im still finding things to do with it I read a lot of reviews before I choose the S7 Seen a lot about battery life and over heating but have not had any issues with it Great color Very great screen display nice volume great pictures and videos super happy with purchase exactly what I hoped it would be really did not want to replace my s3 mini but glad my family did an intervention with me Im happy with it It has all the features I want and great battery life This is the only phone to be able to hold up a constant speed and power for a lot of high quality games It Operates with ease Im newnot new to the smartphone demographic When the very first model iPhone came out I was so stoked that I went out and bought one on release Without even a month using it my iPhone developed a cluster of dead pixels which made the keyboard unusable This turned me totally away from touch screen smart phones for YEARS I stubbornly glued myself to my little flip phones and QWERTY dumb phones and I loved them But as time went on and the smart phone became the goto phone for the general public I decided to try them again My second go at the touch screen phones wasnt a Galaxy phone and had both qualities I loved and cons I didnt like so much But I kept the phone for a couple of years before I decided it was time to move on as the phone was discontinued and I foresaw that it would eventually be a fairly useless brick without more updates So I decided it was time to upgrade and I chose the S7 Edge as it was the newest model and Id heard a lot of positive things about the Samsung Galaxy phones 

I want to start this review with the things I didnt like about the phone to get those out of the way The first couple of things I didnt like about the phone were noticeable right out of the box the phone itself was fragile and SLICK too slick as in it was slipping out of my hands It was clear I needed to purchase a case for it ASAP or I might drop it and it would shatter The second thing I absolutely didnt like made me a little sad for choosing the Edge over the S7 the keyboard rolls onto the Edge screen and if you hold your phone like I do when Im typing the sides of my thumbs would press the keys and make it very hard to type a proper message without having to backspace several times Luckily the problem was solved by going into the settings and disabling the Edge screen so all the features of the Edge screen I just dont use now No big deal I suppose but that was very disappointing for me 
I have not owned the phone long enough to know if this can be disabled or not but some things that annoy me are the insistence that I set up Samsung Pay or connect to DirectTV I do not want to use either of these features
Lastly while the navigation features are great and deserving of some respect I just wish there was a quicker way to quit out your open applications than having to go into settings scroll around to apps go to app manager click on app and Force Quit My last phone was able to quit out and switch through apps with a doubleclick of your home button

Now that the things I didnt like about the phone are out of the way I can talk about what I do like about Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge One of my favourite features is of course the huge screen I didnt think I would like something so big and clunky but the Edge isnt clunky at all and the screen is quite nice and bright It fits nicely in my hand The camera is also amazing I havent even had time to play with all of the pro features yet but having so much control over it is a huge plus
Im in awe of the size of the Android marketplace there are so many apps and the fact that most available apps can crosscommunicate with iOS users makes them worth getting since not all of my friends and family use Android devices
Im usually very frugal about my data and battery usage and its a relief to have options available to block background data from loading I like that I can control how much data is used as well and be able to see reports of how much data is used by each app I never have problems with battery but Im also not the kind to dink around on my phone a whole lot so the battery is usually still around 70 when Im home from work
I can personalise my home screen my dock and the pulldown menu at the top of the screen bringing all of my mostused applications within reach This also makes it easy to turn my phone on mute or vibrate or activate aeroplane mode if I need to save some battery There are many more options and tools as well like a flashlight and a lockprofileautorotate mode
I like the new always on mode Sometimes you just want to know what time it is no buttons necessary

Overall I love the phone so far Its more beginner friendly than I expected but does require a little knowhow if you want to really get it to work the way you want it Wished I ws able to purchase much soone Havent had time to read over the features but actual use has been easy I have always been a Droid fan but this Galaxy  S7 has stolen me away with no regrets I love my galaxy s7 edge the camera is amazing  it is a much better phone then the S5 The Galaxy 7S Edge is my third Samsung phone and each time they just get better The design is sleek and comfortable Loaded with features especially low light camera I would recommend this phone to anyone Son broke my Galaxy S5 Active went to ATT and purchased the Samsung Galaxy s7 Standard phone NOT SO MUCH let me tell youthis phone is definitely a great phone The pictures are awesome and the functions are the same as other galaxies trust me hands down to this phone I went from a Note 3 to an S7 and dont regret it As old as the S7 was it kept up with all the updates Upgrading to the S7 kept myself up to date with the latest and greatest I like the sleek design and interface but some of the features take a little longer to figure out than expected Overall I like it Changed over from the iPhone 6s its been the best moved weve made
It took about week to learn the new system but Ill never go back to the iPhone
This phone is way ahead of the competition Great phone I love it and would not get rid of it Ive owned a galaxy 3 for years now finally decided to make the move up to the galaxy 7 loved my 3 but really love the more sleek design of the 7 and especially the waterproofing capabilities that I have felt that phones should have had all along who doesnt answer their phone during a rain storm This Galaxy S7 Edge is the best phone Ive ever had The features are great Great camera and its water resistant Definitely a must buy I bought this to replace my Windows phone I never had an issue with a phone connecting to my WiFi but this one does The phone has been replaced once and I still have issues My iPhones nor my Windows phones ever had troubles This phone has cost me more money with data overages than I care to talk about The Bluetooth is flakey again never had issues with any of my other phones connecting to my car radio If Samsung would offer my money back I would take it in a heart beat I absolutely love my new Samsung S7 Edge It has great features and everything I need to build my music collection with great apps to help me manage my extensive music library I like some things that the s7 can do I really love they put a memory card slot in Love the color and ease of use After two weeks I am extremely satisfied with the phone What can I say From looks to functionality the S7 Edge blows away the competition Best camera Best looking screen Expandable memory Huge battery that lasts two days with standard use Fast  wireless charging Samsung Pay Gear VR goodness 

This phone is gorgeous and apps are hiccups free I am beyond satisfied The best Samsung phone yet and on a whole different level than iPhone I would not only recommend this to a friend I go out of my way to show everyone what it can do Great job Samsung This is by far the best smart phone Ive ever owned Screen is vivid and colorful battery life is impressive and the camera makes even pictures at disney at night look fantastic It is a bit more expensive of a phone but absolutely worth it This is a great phone Its waterresistant and has an excellent screen size of 51 Grab this phone if you think the Note 5 is too big for your preference The screen looks fantastic and the camera takes pictures with so much clarity It charges fast and has all of the bells and whistles you could ever need I bought this phone when my old one died  So far it has been a great phone  It has a lot of features I havent explored yet but the ones I have work great Great phone I own 2 of them the features display and over all design is top notch Samsung has yet again dominated the market with an innovative superior quality product Just got phone last week I love it Best galaxy phone yet The Galaxy S7 Edge rocks I cant get enough time to enjoy it but when I do I use it to the max Taking pictures listening to music and playing movies is just some of the things I do with it and it is exceptional I highly recommend this phone to anyone that has an older android or wants to switch from iPhone This is a slight improvement over the 6 Edge it replaces I am holding on to my 6 so that when our third line Galaxy3 runs into issues given its age or if it gets damaged that my wife will have a replacement Had the phone about a month Complete battery hog Barely makes it a day Phone is very flimsy Already has a crack Owned my last phone for 3 years and it barely had a scratch Biggest issue is the microphone that is just awful Probably half of my calls I have to hang up and call from a landline so people can hear Did a Google search and learned this is a consistent problem with the Samsung phones Only owned it a month and cant wait to get rid of it My galaxy s7 edge feels good handles good its what a smart phone should be in every way Thanks Samsung for making all of us feel good Pretty  happy with it Replaced S3 and its a great improvement Love that I can see the screen even when Im outside in the bright sunlight Got it a few days ago Love it Just got it a week ago But I love it Just bought the Samsung 7S and am super pleased with the new functions I purchased my Galaxy S7 a week ago Absolutely love it It keeps acting up and it keeps dropping calls I upgraded to an S7 from and S6 I absolutely love the Galaxy series so far and feel like the phone is optimized to provide value and premium functionality for the user the apps interface and viewing experience are better than I have ever seen the only thing so far I am not thrilled with are the speakers they could have a more robust sound volume but overall Good job I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from a Samsung Note 3 While I was pleased with the overall performance of the Note the S7 is so much faster The fast charge feature is a really nice feature although Q3 would have been even nicer I get excellent battery life far better than I ever got from my previous phone The display is crisp and videospictures look great Ive had my phone activated since Sunday afternoon June 5th it constantly shuts off and wont turn back on Its almost like it freezes up and shuts itself off and the only way i can get it to come back on is if i hold the volume key and the power button down for about 810seconds and then select reset normally The only reason i havent called to complain is because ive had VBS at church since Sunday night and ive been working long hours since Sunday I will be visiting a Verizon Store VERY soon to see about getting  a new one Im not happy with this especially since its a new phone and the money i had to pay for it 
If you would like to contact me about this please feel free to call me 
Thank you Bought it maybe 2 weeks ago simply astounding speed amazing download times and excellent service Been using it for several days and upgraded from a S4 Active I love the feel added features lightweight and quality This phone is great Super fast screen is beautiful and the camera is amazingly sharp Had an iPhone 5s for nearly 2 years and Im happy I switched to Samsung The full note does not display I have to go to edit contact to see the note portion of the contact in its entirety Compared to my old device this device is so stable and so fast No error messages in my 2 months of use Ive had this phone a week  All my data transferred It had many new features that I really like Awesome size like water resistance camera is good but could be a little better I like the look but the edge feature is way to sensitive and I hit things all the times with parts of my hand that wouldnt effect a non edge phone I really like the phone except for that I have considered going to the S7 but the screen isnt as big First off I love the look of this thing Very nice and sleak Water resistant and good looking I love the wireless charging and the VR is awesome to Well done Samsung Im looking forward for the arrival of my 50 inch Samsung j5200 
I highly recommend this phone and all Samsung products looking forward to opportunity to participate in Tutorial classes to learn more features and how to use the phone  do more with it This is a great phone I love the speed and also adding the removable storage made this phone a no Brainer to get This phone is hands done the best performing one thus far that I have owned This is my first Samsung phone and I couldnt be happier Ive owned other droids Razor Maxx HD Droid Turbo and a few others but this one blows them out of the water Thank you for developing an amazing product I am sure once I learn how to use it the phone will be good but for now confused with it Do they have class you can attend on how to use it I know when I had my galaxy 4 they had a class you could sign up for Changed from an S4 Mini to the S7 and love it I think this phone might be a little more than I need  I definitely think its a beautiful phone but twice now I have made costly mistakes because I havent had time to learn it  I was aggravated last night because someone was calling me and I couldnt answer the phone Switched from another carrier who did not have good phone service everywhere I  bought  it  about  2   weeks  ago  I  am  real  satisfied  with  it Only had it for a week so far so good still leaning i got my new phone less than a month ago and still learning how to use it Lots of features Easy to read screen However a larger phone requires a little getting use too The camera and size are great Only had it for a week Still figuring out all the features I came over from an iPhone first to the Galaxy s5 now to the s7I love this phone there is so much customization and features that you wont find on the iPhone overall I think this is the best phone on the market I would definitely recommend it to everyone I see and know Bought it over a month ago and just purchase my 2nd one I love everything about the S7 All the features are awesome However Ive been a Motorola Droid guy for a long time and there is no comparison of battery life If SAMSUNG can fix this issue This phone is a grand slam This phone is great I have every app I need installed and even a few I dont I still have plenty of room left 32 gigabytes is amazing plus I love the expandable memory I have ahave a 64 gig micro SD installed I highly recommend this phone Im happy with the phone I absolutely love this device I purchased this device at att because I unfortunately got my Galaxy S5 stolen However this device has so many cool features I honestly wasnt expecting to purchase this device as I was leaning towards the regular S7 but the screen is just phenomenal It takes getting used too since the screen continues on but I think it makes it look much sleeker Tons of compliments from friends since I purchased it Also the edge screen display features are nicely done I love the phonebut sometimes when I get a phone call or message I wont know cause my phone doesnt make a sound This phone is the perfect size not too big not too small The camera is awesome epically in low lighting I took a picture of my son sleeping there was only a small nightlight on in the the corner and I could not believe how clear the picture came out Obviously it wasnt as great as it would be with good lighting but I was very impressed The fingerprint reader I use to unlock my phone can be kind of glitchy After 2 weeks I only have 13gb of memory left but with the memory card slot Im not too worried I love every thing about this phone All features are easy to access The smart switch app was a big help on transferring everything from my old phone Im a big fan of Samsung products Keep up the good work I bought it I love the phone but Im having issues with the screen protector that was sold by verizon its not fitting Switched from S5 and I wouldnt go back cant wait to see whats new from Samsung From the style to the apps this phone delivers everything Easy layout and split screens let you multi task and get more done Its an amazing phone to have Let me start by saying that I have owned many types of phones from android to iphone and the new S7 is the best phone I have ever owned The expandable memory for this phone is great as it accepts up to a 200 gb expansion which is great for all of the photos you should take with this device As a follow up to the photos you should be taking this device has the best low light camera on any phone I have ever owned and is light years better than iphone in my opinion The battery life is exceptional with this phone and I love the wireless charging capabilities that this device provides If you have been considering the Galaxy series of phones the S7 is definitely worth the money I have had a Samsung for over 7 years I love the Samsung

front glass was stronger on drop less than 12 inches hit on corner and cracked the screen I got this about two weeks ago an really like it devise tends to break up during phone calls and will lose connection very frustrating My last phone was an S4  This is so much better  Havent found a feature I dont like I went from a note 4 to a galaxy s7 edge and it was the best decision I have made when it comes to phones I love it and wouldnt trade it for anything Very good battery life The camera has many nice features Upgraded from S3 I upgraded from the HTC and very happy with the s7 comparable to iphone better camera quality and reso some new features  can even pop out a screen and use 2 apps at once in 1 screen or split the screen evenly audio for s7 improved since s5 I love it the new

a much more appealing phone The exterior design of S7 is as good as an iPhone The camera of S7 is simply amazing easily beats its iPhone competitors The feature I like the best is Samsung pay I can save my credit cards and loyalty accounts in my S7 and use them on traditional magnetic card readers Its very convenient which makes my wallet much lighter
Other good features include Always On which enables me to read the current time and battery info without switch on the screen internal waterresistance design builtin fast wireless charging and fast fingerprint reader
Overall this phone is great I think its the best Galaxy S series phone ever I havent had any issues yet I like the size and feel not too bulky This phone is stylish fast lots of features and benefits This phone is truly state of the art with nice hardware specs The battery life is great Bought 2 weeks ago Happy so far The Samsung S7 Edge is the phone Ive been waiting for Even though Ive had more birthdays than the average S7 Edge user I can pair with it like a pro The features are state of the art yet even a nontechy person can utilize each of its benefits I have no fear with trying and exploring different adventures with the Samsung S7 Edge Its battery life and storage are awesome I love how it fits my lifestyle and online needs
Thank you for making this phone mine I love my S7 Edgegold It has a nice sleek design and it fits in my hand just right I bought 3 covers for it and they all look good The camera is awesome too Great Job Samsung I must say this phone has a great LED screen and fits perfectly in my hands Ive had dozens of Android phones and this is definitely my favorite Having a great low light camera and just a much more improved camera really helps I do like that they went back to expandable memory thats how it should be Overall great features no problems I am having really great time for watching movies because of great graphics and dolby sound It also has a good pixels camera and i dont have to carry the camera with me anymore I had the Galaxy S5 and was jealous when my husband upgraded to the S6  However once I realized memory could not be added to the S6 I was determined to keep my S5 forever  I was hopeful that Samsung would wise up not be like the iPhones and the S7 would allow us to add memory with an Sd card  My wish came true  So far the S7 has been great I upgraded from the flop of a S6 into the S7 I am happy they put back the memory slot and improved the battery I am a fan of this phone and enjoy the features it has I am a meteorology fan How cool it would be to plug and play a weather station to this phone and an outstanding app Clear call quality sharp clear display This phone is the best Im always playing with it and discovering new things this phone can do Best phone Ive ever had Phone would not unlock with trace pattern display and reset to factory start Needed to use gmail account attached to phone to reset but would not accept correct email Camera 1010 great night photos

Water resistance hopefully 1010 Nobody can even understand or hear me when they call never had that with my S4  Phone freezes up and drops calls alot Does everything as advertised and more Every day I find something else that I didnt know So far so good  Loving the device Im so glad I switched back to Samsung They are definitely the best brand of phones From the themes to samsung pay to the camera this phone is just awesome You can customize how you want it is very user friendly There are many small features that flat out make the phone that much easier to use I upgraded from a s5 to this not expecting there to be too much of a change but it is so much better The operating system is great I bought this phone bc Microsoft and Verizon cant seem to come to terms regarding Windows Mobile Phones and I had just broken my Nokia Lumia 928  While having access to a ton of apps that I didnt have access to before has been great not being able to edit my Outlookcom Contacts so that my contacts are all in one place whether on my phone or on the computer has proven very disappointing  I know I can do this with a Google account and it work the same as it did with my Outlook account but I am just too interdependent with Outlook to transition

Hardwarewise the phone is very good  I do find that the wireless antenna is not as good as my previous phone and I find the phone dropping calls in areas where it didnt have that problem with my old phone I am disappointed that the battery is no better than my S6  When the tech at the phone store used the app to transfer everything to my new phone none of my Verizon contacts or my calendar was transferred to the new phone Not worth upgrading Tons of features camera quality isnt as great as the iPhone Other than that great phone It never over heats the battery life is amazing the screen is just the right size for me and its super fast Absolutely LOVE this phone Phone is greattransition from Windows to Android a bit of a challenge for a couple of days  Better explanation in Help for key functions perhaps would have been good Best phone I have ever used I got this removed because it had a competors name on the review Ill try not to invlove the competitors name on it Well Ive had every single phone from the competitor we all know who it is Ive had the first one including the the original to recent one even the inbetweens The S7 Edge is my first Android device that I love and find easy to use I had the double tap to unlock phone but I would barely use it due to me wanting to stick to the competitor If i had the choice between the competitor or samsung Id choose samsung anytime I really wish I would have started with a Galaxy It been about a month now and I havent even touched the competitors phone Im hoping to get the S8 when it comes out as well The reasons for this is that that the S7 has better customization which sold me from the start Its software is a bit more complicated but due to not really knowing the settings and geuestures of the phone I mean from being so used to the competitors phone since theyre barley alike even when making a call or messaging I also love the curved edge even though from the start Id hit the sides a lot Another great thing about it is the water resistantproof since I go swimming a lot in summer Side to side the competitor and S7 are comparable being used for their own purpose but the shortcuts and animations on the S7 makes it faster and easier to use even though from the start it didnt feel like it was Im glad I did the change and I hope samsung keep on pulling out great devices like the S7 Edge I cant wait to see what samsung pulls out of their sleeves next All my family and friends know i only buy Samsung cell phone The S7 is a great phone A ton of features and easy to use for the phone savvy and the novice alike The only thing I would change is the glass If it was a gorilla glass style I know many others would be happy as well Im so glad I skipped the S6 and waited for the S7 I always buy Samsung phones and tablets and this is the best phone It has so many features Happy with the purchase I love it The improvements over the S6 are subtle but valuable I really like the curved edges of the screen and its clarity and resolution The screen has a fantastic feel to it I was shocked at how well the fingerprint lock feature works I didnt expect it to pick up my print so quickly and easily I just want to say this is by far the best phone I have ever had I love the edge display it and how you can make quick and easy callsmessages and go to your apps just by swiping from the side of your screen The camera is awesome It takes amazing pictures and the speed of the phone is wonderful The battery lasts all day and even into the 2nd day without having to charge it and to charge it from almost being drained takes such a short time Thank you Samsung for creating such a great phone I upgraded from the S5 to S7 primarily because I heard the pictures were better quality The issue is that the quality of videos are still not good when sending in a text  still pixelates and distorts   Also some of the features with contacts and lock screen are not with the S7 I do like that the video posting on 
fb has better quality   The screen size is a little bigger too and thats good Wow I have to say Im very impressed with this phone I thought it was going to be like my last Galaxy Note4  slow over heated laggy and touch sensitive Everything about this phone has turned me to a galaxy fan once again 

Speakers could be better but Im always on headphones anyway Moderate phone fewer apps and many apps dont want but cannot get rid of should be easy to get rid of apps I donot want Getting used to it Love it Its better than the S5 It is what it says it is I spilled a drink n it repelled Im still learning new thing everyday about this phoneI luv it Bought 1 week ago  Phone crashes at least once a day Have to hard reboot Apps did not download  missed about half of them Great quality phone overall  The security features are outstanding the camera is by far the best camera Ive had on any previous phone I personally am very satisfied with it Screen is too small The specs and over all performance of this phone are incredible to say the least
This phone really lives up to the hype unlike other phones who claim to have so much this Samsung Galaxy s7 edge lives up to every expectation
With the Octa core processor its lightning fast and very efficient
Very glad that its better in low light as well as bringing the memory expandability back because that was one of Samsungs best features
Over all this is definitely my favorite phone I love everything about this phone Easy to navigate and everything This is a great phone However the edge technology leaves something to be desired Maybe with more time better uses will be made of it The camera and processing power of the s7 egde in nice also I love this phone so much better then my iPhone The pictures it takes are phenomenal I would recommend this phone to everyone We bought three new s 7s and  couldnt be happier The new video call feature has helped us stay connected when people are away on trips  The many ways that it can be customized makes sure we dont mix up the phones My family purchased three Samsung Galaxy 7 phones  they are by far the best phones weve owned Samsung products are everywhere in my home  as long as they keep making high quality products I will continue giving them business Went from a galaxy 4 to this galaxy 7 and Im so happy I waited so long to up grade Totally worth it Only issue is the glass screen cover doesnt cover the entire screen but you get used to it I am very happy with this phone Nice display great response love that its waterproof and has wireless charging I will be adding a 64g micro sd so I have tons of storage Love my new galaxy s7 edge size great camera awesome Perfect size and easy to use One of the selling points is its waterproof Love anything Samsung I am extremely satisfied with my purchase The device has endless features and looks amazing Havent run into any problems with it Best phone Ive had in a long time Easy to use has great features especially the camera just the right size Ive had this phone about a month And so far its been all good The response time of the phone is excellent and the look and feel is also amazing 

The features are spot on The reason behind the 4 star rating on features is the fact that there is some limitation to the customisation of the edge screen at least as far as I know It will freeze and not go to the next screen  Sometimes in different apps or situations it wont even let me click the button Just freezes We put off upgrading because the decisions are hard to make This time it went pretty fast The S7 is a phone you know how to use but it has so much more to offer speed screen memory rugged and updated OS Everything I need to do it does it so much better Plus its waterproof Longer battery life wireless charging and great Bluetooth in the car Its a Nationals type home run for me Great phone love the waterproof feature dropped it in the lake by the boat landing just picked it up and dried the phone off This phone so far has been excellent I thought I would miss some of the options from my last phone but the speed and reliability of this phone has made up for it It is also relaxing that I can stand by the pool with kids playing without worrying about my phone getting wet Great Job Samsung The Samsung S7 is a great Phone I love that it lasts 48 hours and then only takes
one and a half hours to recharge one of the best phone in the market right now for the price I bought this Galaxy S7 a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it The fingerprint unlock is awesome And I love how you can add more than your thumb I also love the interface I upgraded from an S3 and Im already used to Samsung I also like that its water proof and dust proof too Ive been a Samsung owner of many different products over the years and the is by far my favorite from the screen to the camera and the software its a great experience from end to end A very nice cell phone great features that I love very good pictures great quality the only defects that I found is thanot sometimes turn off by it self and I dont like that and I dont know why  Recently upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and was totally blown away 
amazing phone all around 
The product speaks for itself Will definitely recommend this phone other I love my new phone Even the battery seems better than ever The phone is great however I miss the menu key and the longer screen timeout I love this phone Its noticeably faster and seems like theyre is a lot less bloat ware The ability to record my screen is awesome Its fast and easy to navigate Fast wifi Great camera Switched from Windows 10 phone since it is going nowhere All transitions were smooth except the calancer does not sync well with my PC Email with outlook is fine Great phone Amazing battery life Ive bought one for my entire family Good phone so far its fast Replaced my galaxy S4 It has better battery life than iphone 6s In the beginning it used to discharge quicker but after few charges it lasts longer Also the fast charger option is good Plenty of features but i hoped the interface to be simpler and easy to use both of which lack in this device All in all good phone and integrates with my samsung tv I was enjoying it at first But the phone kept getting hot That worried me So I decided to let it go I loved my Galaxy S3 and wanted a new one But it did work out for me Too bad Had the galaxy s5service was great  Upgraded to the s7drop calls everywhere I go Only had phonenough a week 45 pretty good overall Still has touch wiz tho unfortunately Love almost everything about it but needs a larger selection of ringtones  But there are lots of apps for that   Its fast has a gorgeous display and is easy to use after my LG2 Great product for everyday usemuch better than any other phone on the current market Great phone I previously had a WP phone for over 4 years loved it but it was so limited and did nothing The 41MP camera was the only thing This camera looks just as good and takes the pictures very quickly All the other features are great also Love the Heartbeat sensor and the S Health app Am in love with this phone Its waterproof which am not going to try out Can not think of anything that it couldnt do or aprove on Well maybe a GPS that dont need data all the time So far I like the phone but I am still learning the features Sometimes I find it easy to accidently start an app I didnt want to run Other times the screen doesnt seem very sensitive I had the Galaxy Note 5which is an older phone and older OS mind you This phone is nowhere near the quality of that previous phone The only reason I upgraded was because I lost my phone in the river on a kayaking trip about 3 weeks ago and had to get a new one Economically the only was for anyone to afford one is to upgrade 

The screen sensitivity is so weird on this phone Sometimes random parts of the screen will be activated like I have pressed them But most of the time the bottom part of the screen is completely unresponsive I have to press the space bar or return key multiple multiple times before it even registers that I have touched the screen This makes it next to impossible to type without focusing on the screen completely It is very time consuming and inefficient 

The camera sucks if the flash is activated My Note would snap the picture immediately Not this phone and not the S6 either The phone flash will come ongo offwait for itwait for itflash again and pic is taken Guess what My subjects thought the first flash was the actual picture and now they have all moved NO Wait wait wait My stupid phone sucks That wasnt the picture Please get back where you were and pose againfor about 25 seconds before you move so I can try again NowI have missed my moment Thanks Samsung NOT

I would NOT recommend this phone and honestly I would give ANYTHING to go back to my older phone I wish I had traded this phone in before my grace period was over Now Im stuck with a terrible phone 

Not happy Just learning the features however the overall ease of use is great Far better in speed and intuitiveness than my previous phone purchasing this cell phone was one of the most awesome and wise decision Ive ever made the features accessible the Sheik design All the apps are accessible to my fingertips no drop calls I think Samsung designed this product the user in mind My previous cell phone was the Galaxy 4 but the two can be compared themail S7 is awesome I wish I had a choose the S7 Edge but because my money was a little funny I have to go with the S7 Yeah Im so pleased with this S7 I wouldnt trade it for anything the camera is so awesome the pictures are so clear I really like this Android the customization is my favorite part The phone is working amazing The features are great I can play all the app games I love The resolution is really high quality Defiently love this phone Very easy to use and love the battery life I like my Samsung 7 edgethe screen size is perfecteasy to use Incredible camera produces professional quality photographs  Love the speed and the ease of transition from my Samsung Galaxy S5 to this new S7 I just bought the S7 and it has all the features I need in a smartphone and is also light and has a smooth touch  For me all the builtin notification sounds available could be a bit louder as most of them are harder to hear depending on where one is I switched from the s5 to s7 Samsung makes the best phone period I love the battery time I have had just about all of the Samsung models and I  simply love it Just switched from an iPhone 5s love the Samsungs features tons of memory and expandable if I want too  intuitive features awesome display amazing low light cameraamateur photographer waterproof perfect size gives u a sense of control and freedom that I was missing with the iPhonethis feels like my phone noto something that I borrowed from apple anyway so far very happy with it wish longer battery life and Im exploring app integration with other platforms so far so good Go for it I  miss a lot of the features the galaxy 5 had But some body decided to remove the features that made the galaxy easy and convenient Disappointed camera has not improved To mute phone is more difficult  Should have tried note 5 Can no adjust touch sensitivity The Samsung Galaxy S7 is one of Samsungs flagship phones It lives up to its name and my expectations  All around great phone with features and hardware that youd expect from the newest technology I can not rate this phone problem with both phones simple cards keeps dropping a lot of our calls Just purchase last week received a Samsung smart tvlove both products The battery isnt as impressive as I thought but its not bad Charging is very slow and with moderate use is ready for a charge later in the day Im not disappointed just hoped for a little more
Otherwise this photo editing is fantastic The camera is awesome The call clarity is very clear Its only been a couple of weeks but so far Im quite happy The Samsung s7 edge has a beautiful sexy display if there is such a thing in smart phones Larger than my s5 active I love the curved edges I love that it withstands water This phone has very high quality looks and feels every bit of the price tag My only complaint with it is that the screen edges are rounded to the point where the web of my thumb will press buttons I do not want This issue was resolved by adding a case The screen is very sensitive sometimes too sensitive and there is no way to adjust it like there was on the Galaxy S5 I bought the phone a week ago and so far I love it Still learning all the new things it does Simply excellent device Live this phone even better than the Note I had previously  Transition was easy  Great features I bought the product a fortnight ago and it has consolidated functionality Great phone and features Ive been using an iPhone since 3Gs days wanted to try an Android The S7 Edge is my first Android phone and I could not be happier with it Still learning Android and how some things work but for someone like me somewhat of a gadget geek Android is bringing back some of the fun with smart mobile phones This the best phone I have ever owned Battery life is outstanding I work in places with such terrible reception that have drained other phones but not his one Easier to operate too I had some good phones but never had a Samsung and when I got the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge I was blown away by the features and design It is a great phone and I would recommend it to my friends This phone is awesome and is only missing a pen The camera is great I had all Notes phone  so that is why Im missing the pen But everything is awesome There is no better phone available And YES you can get it wet I highly recommend this phone especially on Verizon I have owned this phone now for about 2 weeks and after owning nothing but iPhones for the last 6 years i will say that the only problems I ran into are the difficulty in transitioning from one phone OS to another The Galaxy did require me to learn simple functions found on the iPhone more easily however after learning the features and flexibility of the Galaxy S7 I am definitely satisfied with this product The other problem was with the phone getting hot while using the VR Gear headset The VR Gear and apps itself are absolutely fantastic I am still learning about my new Galaxy S7 I am a senior citizen but Samsung has made a phone that even I can figure out I love this phone is fast and very easy to use i can do so much with it over all i love it Fast performance tough endurance and external storage is what I was looking for and thats what I got I love it I just love my new beautiful phone Battery life is great Love the external storage and the water resistants I have been wanting this phone for a long time now Compared to previous versions this phone has by far the best camera and camera features I like the Samsung Galaxy There is no comparison between the old iPhone I had  my s6 But for the 1st time ever I dropped my s6  had to get a new phone I thought I would upgrade to the s7 since I had been so happy with the s6 I have yet to discover any upgrades In fact one of the most important things to me was the fantastic camera in my s6 I dont think the camera is near as good in the s7 It doesnt seem to zoom as good  the clarity isnt as good either Everything else seems to be just the same I enjoy taking photos and am still learning all the features So I recently switched back from Samsung to iPhone not by choice but as soon as I was able I got rid of my iPhone and picked up an older S5 just because I love the galaxy line that much So as fate would have it my S5got stolen and luckily I was eligible for an upgrade So naturally I went with the S7I have had it for a little over two weeks and I am absolutely in love with this device I literally use my phone for everything and with the S7 I can do everything I need to do and then some I will forever be a Samsung customer thank you for continually putting out amazing devices Great camera sleek design and awesome battery and great display very nice phone neat features lots to learn fits really nice in your hand This is a great phone The only bad thing about it is the battery drains just a little fast but that also depends on what all Im doing on the phone that day It takes excellent pictures and is very fast I love this phone It is an excellent phone with amazing features

The best part of the phone by far is the camera The autofocus was clearly a ground breaking innovation

I have had the phone for 4 months and the only downside I see is that it seems to have slowed in response time ever so slightly after about a month of owning it However this should not deture you from a purchase by any means I bought a gold Samsung Galaxy S7 a week ago and I love it I had a white Galaxy S4 prior to buying the S7 Im eager to learn as much as I can about using the changedimproved features of the S7  Monthly payments are a godsend The Samsung s7 is easy to use and has great features and is great for teens Love my phone I had a note 4 but dropped it in a bucket of water Ive had my S7 for bout 2 weeks now and love this phone I love this phone it fits so comfortably in my hand it is so lightweight and thin that I dont have to worry about dropping it It is very fast and I love the edge technology I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 active and it is wonderful but this one beats it by far I recommend this phone Fast and with a great camera Easy transition from an older cheap Samsung phone using Smart Switch Liking Samsung Pay although 2 out of 9 credit cards I have dont work with it Ive had this phone for a little under a month I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Immediately I noticed the phone ran a lot faster and more smoothly than my s5 The battery life seemed really great at first having come from a battery life of about an hour The battery life usually lasts all day sometimes extending into the next day I use the phone pretty frequently too so its pretty good even with heavy use Im hoping that the life of the battery doesnt deteriorate too bad over time It charges really fast with the stock charger it came with I like that the speakers are at the bottom egde of the phone now rather than on the back On the s5 it was really easy to cover up the speakers with your hand or by setting the phone down on a flat surface The front facing camera seems much better on the s7 than it was on the s5 The s5 seemed to distort the front facing cameras pictures Its much better on the s7 for those who enjoy taking selfies and such The rear facing camera is pretty decent but I havent used it much yet I noticed a few glitchy things when I first started using the phone but it hasnt happened again Basically I would click on an app and it would repeatedly pop up and close in quick flashes and the screen wouldnt respond This was within the first couple of days of use but it seems to have stopped Sound quality from the speakers is good Thats about all I have to say for this review so far Im coming from an iPhone and have found this phone to be everything that I needed Lots of fun as well as useful features Perfect size and the battery will last all day Just upgraded from S5 to S7 Almost the exact same phone just upgraded Easy transition I just got this phone about a week ago I absolutely love it I moved up from my S5  Im glad I did The only thing I dont like about it is how fast the battery dies The features on this phone is awesome Lightweight and fits in to your hand greatly The imagedisplay on the screen is very clear You can see all the details on the phone By far the best phone I have owned My S7 has great features the speaker is great its fast Love love my phone Doesnt get hot when charging Connects to my bluetooth fast The color I chose is great 
I would recommend this phone to my family and friends without a doubt I bought it a week ago and I love it I purchased the S7 as a replacement for my LG G3 but previously owned the S5 and S3 The S7 is a remarkable upgrade from my previous phones in terms of both performance and features While I was used to having a bigger phone I have found that I actually prefer the size of the S7  and the display is awesome with excellent sharpness The battery life is decent enough to last through the day with normaltoheavy usage Also Samsung Pay is lifechanging and far superior to its competitors

The only complaints that I have is that the edges of the screen are slightly beveled which makes finding a good screen protector difficult and the speaker This may not be a concern to some people but I prefer to have the piece of mind of having a good fitting tempered glass screen protector on my phone In regard to the speaker I believe that it is just not as loud as other phones I have owned 

Overall a great phone that I am very happy with Blows away all other phones in 2016 I love this phone Had the previous model Great features I also love this new color The water resistant feature is a great selling point Love the color Very pleased with the pictures Very good product Love the camera features and the larger battery I havent used all the new Apps yet new compared to my old S5 but should soon
Great phone Hate upgrading phones They cost way to much Upgraded from an S4 and am glad that I did Phone works great Screen is beautiful It just works The s7 edge is clearly the phone of the yearThis phone is better than iPhonesThe edge feature is just incredible and so far I have had no problems with the phoneThe waterresistant feature is just amazing and so is low light cameraThe camera is just amazing and so is the zoomI would clearly recommend this product to anybodyThe phone is also great because of the volume feature and is also great because it is compatible with almost any VR and aside from the phone all my 3 Samsung products seem to work fine I was blown away by the s7 edge Snappy responses great builtins etc until 2 weeks in I dropped my phone WITH a case on maybe a foot and a half And voila a crack on the lower left side of my beautiful screen The only complaint that I have is that the s7 edge is fragile and must be treated as such I Just Purchased The Samsung Galaxy S7 32GB  This my First Smart Phone  It is a big step up from feature Phone i had Before  The Cost of Phone is High But this is the Flagship Model I love this phone I went from iPhone to samsung galaxy It is different but I choose Samsung Im generally happy leith this phone Tho the sensitivity of the screen I keep hitting l wrong buttons The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge had great features It had amazing speed and performance I would highly recommend it This is a great phone I upgraded from a s4 to the s7 and the controls were very close so it didnt take much get the hang of this phone Very good product oh and the camera takes fantastic shots very clear and crisp I love my new phone It has a super high quality screen fabulous camera and it was easy to adjust to that first week Once you go Galaxy 7 youll never go back Great camera features Would like longer battery life Disappointed with in ear headphones that came with phone Barely stay in ear Would like speakers on both sides and earphone hookup on top In speaker loudnesswith headphones in not great either I have to say this is the most responsive phone I have ever owned Love the fact that Samsung brought back the SD card port if you get a fast enough card you will not notice any dip in performance The battery life is beyond great I still have about 50 left by the time I go to bed The size is perfect I had the S6 edge before this phone and it was just a tad to big I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone The Samsung Galaxy 7 is a great phone only problem I have with it is the volume is low in the glass is easily cracked other than that its a great product Held off on the s6 edge stuck with my note edge
the S7 has truly stepped up and reinvigorated the edge Phone performs flawlessly Paired with a GearVR 
You cant beat it At the time of this post the S7 edge is the most powerful phone on the market and will not break your bank Of all the smartphones Ive used to date this one is by far the best one Ive ever owned I absolutely love everything about this phone The size iso perfect Pictures and videos is better then I everealized seen on a phone Easy to use User Friendly apps When I got this phone I was so excited to test out the speed of this phone I was surprised at how fast this phone really was and even showed it off to friends and told them it was better than their iPhone Unfortunately they didnt believe me until we put it to the test and now they wished they would have gotten a Samsung Galaxy s7 Wish I would have stayed with my note 4  I may return this as its not really what I was looking for Upgraded from galaxy s5 to this and Im wowed i enjoy it alot havent really got a chance to load bunch of games on it i woudlve given it 5 stars but having issues with my alarm clock not working other then that i enjoy its waterproof capabilities Love the updated fingerprint scanner had the s5 and had nothing but problems with it with the s7 it works everytime I still had the S4 and was so in need of a new phone The S7 was the right choice I had my Galaxy S3 for over 4 years it was a heard decision to give it up but I am very happy I did I love  my Galaxy S7 Love the size and soeaker So far this phone is greatI live Samsung phones so Im not worried Its a good phone Bought the phone a few weeks ago and love it Camera is great apps are great and I just love the phone Only downfall is the battery Its slowly getting better but I find myself charging it once or twice throughout the day Very happy with the galaxy s7 The HD calling is amazing This phone has so many great features I dont even know where to start As for the battery I use my phone throughout the day and Ive never had a problem  I charge it overnight every night  and by 10p I still have at least 30 charge Im just wishing I have bought this phone sooner great design and I just love the new features like video call Didnt think Id like this phone that much  but its been great I miss a few features that were on my S4 like the smart alarm and I like the pictures its camera took better than those coming from the S7 I really like this phone its very nice fast and beautiful design As a user of samsung products the s7 phone is the best phone I have ever used The screen is so clear and bright The camera with the zooming makes great pictures and with the action for still pictures is so neat Excellent device great pictures good quality volume and most of all nice phone I have been a Samsung fan for a while now and have followed the product line up the one thing that bothers me the most is that the front screen never goes to sleep which draws on the battery throughout the day Now as i am a Noob to this phone it could just be a setting issue and operator error The other thing is it likes to push buttons on its own while it is in your pocket purse so you have to be certain you push the button on the side to lock the screen or it will change settings and all kinds of weird stuff on its own When i took it in to tech support they didnt have an answer as to why this was happening or how to stop it I LOVE the Galaxy S7edge so much that I bought 2 gave 1 to my husband We love the slick design its light weight  its not bulky Its fastwhatever youre looking for or searching youll be there within seconds Our schedules are long  full sometimes so we love the idea of video calling without having to download an app Also the S7edge comes in 32 gigs I bought this phone a few weeks ago to replace my S4 mini that was no longer syncing my google accounts  Its a lot larger and does not fit in my pocket but does sync my google accounts well  I also switched cell phone carriers and am just trying to get used to everything This phone truly is a game changer From the vibrant crisp colors to the fast charging long lasting battery I am seriously impressed My phone battery literally lasts me the whole day compared to previous phones Ive owned where Ive had to charge 2 to 3 times a day I have dropped my phone several times and i only have a minor scratch so i know its meant to last especially with the water resistance Samsung you have really outdone yourself Thanks for making life better Dont know much about it seems good so far It doesnt seem like its hard to learn Only had this phone 2 weeks but have gotten to know how to work  it Very glad to switch my boys from a prepaid phone to this one  So many great features good battery life and nice protection from water I am having problems with the settings to confusing I have never really been disappointed by Galaxy Phones before and this one was no different It is comfortable in the hand responds well to touch and voice and it is fairly light weight regardless of what kind of a punch this phone has I am still getting used to the Edge part of the device I sometimes find myself pressing the keyboard incorrectly as I am holding my phone however it is not enough to discourage my rating of this phone Definitely a great update compared to the s6 edge  

Love the sleek design of the phone Phone is easy to use and easy to understand for a new smart phone buyer Samsung has always lived up to its name from TVs to phone and nay other electronics that has their name on it Ive had this product for two months and it has provided everything I need in a cell This phone is the best producti recommend for you As this is my 1st cellphone the learning curve is steep I recommend that one should NEVER skip any of the original installationsetup steps There was an issue with the reseller they put the phone on the wrong  and when the setup was done it was only partially completedand 4 weeks later I am still encountering issues
Great features Solid support quality built Many excellent features top or near top in class The camera time lag between shots is nonexistent this is a super feature as well as the burst feature Sharing photos is easy Screens respond magically quickly the split screen is great the fingerprint security is great peace of mind The ability to talk to text once I resolved the kinks is excellent
MediumSound quality better than Mxxxxxxx not quite as good as the xxx10 That must be why the phone came wheadphones
ProblemsFor this phoneunlike my wifes xxx 10 the only way to do the setup is to kill all data and settings and start all over again and after i had already spent 1015 hours getting the phone partially functioning w some of the previous file data I was unwilling to start from scratch I found some of the OEM loaded apps difficult or non responsive The keyboard was switched to Swift key the bar code reader offered by Samsung didnt work xxx Scanner does Svoice doesnt seem to work as well as xxx Voice The email and text message and contacts programs all needed changes or several attempt to make the settings and syncro work After many hours of work the phone does function better After reading the whole manual twice I still find my self stymed when the phone wants to load new apps I did not select to load and then it locks up the old ap I will say Samsung support and COMPANY OWNED xxx carrier store  support has been unfailingly polite and patient with my lack of knowledge and experience The reseller was worse than useless as they permanently disabled my previous phone and that should never have happened Still havent figured how to unselect data download so large data downloads and syncs are done thru only wifi and not thru mobile data while I have the mobile data turned on so I can use the phone Moved from a Samsung Note 3 to the S7 and was most pleased with the battery performance  Love the faster charging too  Have only had the phone for a week or so and am still familiarizing myself with all of the features and trying to figure out what works best for the way I want to use the phone but am very happy with it so far Im glad I upgraded from the S5 to the S7  Much easier to use and a ton of cool features   I love it I love this phone My last phone was a Galaxy S3 When it was time to get a new phone I knew I wanted another Galaxy The Galaxy 7 has a nice big screen but is not clumsy The transfer of info from my previous phone was great All my apps contacts  messages were moved with ease And the camera has many more features Super clear pictures Great design sound is great for TV and customization options are amazing Wallpapers can be placed on top of themes without interfering with custom themes I love it best part is that its resistant to water damage Living on the ocean makes that a must The Samsung Galaxy S7is simply the best phone in the market Everything I hoped for and more Great camera Easy to use apps Screen resolution is outstanding Water resistant is a bonus Love this phone I am learning new features every day This is my first smart phone  So far I like it I have had my phone a little over a week It was a great choice Has all the features from last phone and more Love it Love the builtin features A little different than my old S4 Had to learn all the new ways the S7 stores the icons and your information Ive always loved samsung Ive only come across a couple things that arent customizable But overall the phone is great Absolutely love it Blazing fast Incredible to look at and the camera is amazing especially in low light Had a note 4 before and loved it Have 4 Samsung TVS 4k Blu Ray Player and a huge Samsung fan Being able to streat stuff directly to my TVS is a huge plus and the quality is amazing Also pairs perfectly with my gear S2 Absolutely no complaints I love the phone and would recommend to anyone I had a recent HTC I was dissapointed from the start but wanted to pay down before going back to an android Im still learning the bells and whistles but overall very please Got my google music back Niceeeeee Something I needed for long time Technology finally caught up to a usefull device Baught this a couple of days ago love it Nice phone and camera but doesnt work consistently   Gives a notice that the sim card is missing    Remove it  put it back in and the thing works great  until you get another message that there is no  sim card   Happens about  every two days  Traveling and have to stop and reinstall the sim card so it will work again Everything from taking videos to using the calculator is excellent and fast The S7 is not just an excellent device but and an all around experience This Galaxy s7 is great I love the features and the features brought back from the s5 Too complicated  no instructions  dont know how to use it We bought these phones less than a month ago and we are content with them Its not a huge difference from the s6 but being that thexplains s7 is more durable then most anything my main concern is water I was sold on buying it Plus I love galaxy for the fact I can change everything on my phone without jailbreaking it like an iPhone I recommend this phone to anyone that asks me about it It over rules an iPhone all day long But Im not willing to test the water theory on purpose Lol Love the cameragreat pics even in dark Easy to usespeakers sound great Love that its waterproof Very happy with this phone Biggest complaint is the keyboard is messed up Any key on the bottom row works how it should only sometimes So typing this and any other message  text becomes a big pain There are features from the s5 and 6 galaxy just decided to throw away Eg automated email and sms message delay for those of us who type and send a message before we realize we made a mistake  IR blaster used for universal remotes  swype is no longer standard on the phone and a few other things
I could get over the other stuff here if the freaking keyboard would work properly
Love that its suppoosed to be water proof   more rugged cased anyway though Im hesitant to test it Such a good phone so many options that make the phone great to use and easy to use  Starting to love it in the process of discovering more about my edge s7 I am very impressed with this smartphone I am blown away at how well Samsung has done with this product It was an easy transition and I love using it as my daily driver I would recommend this product to all my friends and family this phone surpasses any expectation you have for a phone its fast its sleek and it feels premium the camera the screen and the smoothness blow my mind I will never purchase a phone from any other company thanks samsung for this amazing product I chose this over the note and the edge because of its waterproof properties and because I could put a protection around it that would allow for me to carry it even when I am at the pool with my child who swims on his swim team year round I needed a phone that would allow me to accidentally drop it in the water or on the ground or sling it across the pool deck on accident and still hold up Ive had this phone for about 2 months now and I have done all of those things and the phone is still working perfectly with Nary a scratch on it Between my LifeProof case and the phones protection I have a reliable phone that allows me to do the activities that I need to do OK phone Not much better than S5 A better display Love most of the apps that came with the phone A little trouble with the Samsung Milk Music App but still working on it Happy with the feel of the phone in my hand and the touch screen The sound volume of the different applications is terrific

This phone smokes my wifes iPhone6S shes jealous of mine Its a really nice phone The performance screen and battery life was a great upgrade over my old S4 
Just wish it was half an inch smaller overall The S7 so far is one of the best phones I have bought I used to have the S5 and I thought that one was great but the S7 greatly improved on the S5 This phone is fast and the expandable storage is awesome The camera is awesome I like how the pictures come out crisp and clear I have always been an IPhone user and a week ago I purchased this product and I am very impressed This product maintains battery life much longer The quality and camera in my opinion is better And lastly the Samsung Galaxy 7 fits well in your hand This phone is probably the best Ive ever had Cant wait for s8 The Samsung s7 Edge is awesome Its easy to use not heavy and not too big The camera alone is great I get beautiful pictures all the time Samsung out did themselves this time Easy to use Great features No pictures to add This phone has great features but I came from the Galaxy S5 so Im not sure what the S6 had The S7 has a speaker at the bottom of the phone which is nicer than the speaker mounted on the backside This phone is water proof even though there are no port covers also nice because they kept breaking on my S5 Wireless charging could be useful but the phone coming with a charger for that would be even better 

There are a whole bunch of bells and whistles in the phone which I dont need or use so I cant comment on them Just know that this phone can do way more than you will ever need it to 

The only thing I do not like about it is that you cannot remove the battery ON the other hand it comes with an adaptive fast charger which literally charges your phone in minutes if you have a power source 

This phone feels more solid and sturdier than other Galaxys Ive had All in all I love the Galaxy S7 and always recommend it over all other makers I have owned Samsung player and phones as long as I can remember this is there best release yet for my business Being a road warrior I use my phone for all my work functions when on the road I can not say enough about using GPS on this phone dont think I will ever be lost again Sorry not a social bug yet but when I am ready to go there I am sure the features will support my needs I did a lot of research on all phones before I purchase Galaxy again for me I like to control my world and the i7 Edge gives me just that Only drawback I can think of is its not bullet proof I am sure that wont be long 

Enjoy Love this phone Lives up to hype Great battery life and fast processor Wonderful display I love the design even though it is hard to take care of because it can break easily love the speed camera battery  and everything else about it Once you make the change you immediately feel the freedom and understand all youve been missing out Best way to experiment it is to go out and switch your phone for anow S7 Upgraded from HTC M8 to Samsung S7like it a lot The only thing I miss is the stereo speakers Battery life is not the bestotherwise nice phone Was a bit skeptical going into this phone from my note 4 edge But Ive been blown away with how much I love this phone The utility with my gear s2 watch was awesome and felt alot lighter than I thought Only major concern for me was the speakers didnt feel as loud as my note 4 edge But wasnt a deal breaker Very satisfied with this purchase and will continue to buy into the samsung name I find the key board for the phone way to small  The microphone is to small smileys covers it  Just got it and love it It is a similar size to my S5 but has a better feel It started up well and it was very easy to bring over all of my data and apps from the S5 which ATT took as a trade in after deleting everything

It was easy to set up Samsung pay and Ive tried to use it twice but havent got it to work yet Ill try it again a couple of times maybe I can get it to work it looks like a good idea and more secure than a normal credit card transaction but I need to get it to work

The photos are spectacular and the speed of the phone and the screen quality are both superb With the Samsung Galaxy s7 support you always have help and your fingertips Well worth the purchase dont delay see for yourself The best camera and phone is here Having had this phone only a week I find it to be a worthy upgrade from my S6 Most things feel similar though quicker and sleeker than before This phone practically operates itself Many cool features and it is comfortable to use I lost my iPhone 4s that I had forever and now I am glad I did I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to step boldly into the future Got it two weeks ago and its the best device Ive bought yet The phone has easy to use features I have always been a fan of android however I had been using an iPhone for work and am so glad to be back with an Android phone I had shyed away from Samsung in recent years but decided to give the GS7 a try because of how highly rated it was And It is very clear why it has such a good reputation This is hand down the best phone ever made to date I am loving this phone Its easy to use and the picture and sound quality is great Being its been 3 years since I last upgraded my phone there are some great new features I now own a phone that fits in my pocket and while I miss the spen I will be strong and not cry Hate the new Galaxy7 and the android os I just bought it about 2 weeks ago and I love it Loved the Samsung Galaxy s5 so upgraded to the galaxy s7 I love it This phone is easy to use I like it The only problem is that it is just a bit too big for my hand Hmmmm The Samsung Galaxy 7 is so easy to use  My son and I both got one and we are both happy From the first day the phone would over heat and shut down for hours at a time It was replaced today I wish I would have reviewed other phones Ive always had an iPhone Im glad I switched the Samsung Galaxy S7 Great decision Only had the phone 2 weeks but what I have noticed the most is power consumption is half what the Galaxy S5 was  Although I have not placed as many apps on the phones main screens  Someone shared with me those apps use the phones RAM and draw on power because they are always loaded  So far the phone is good to go  Just make sure you have all your info backed up and your SD card unmounted before you take it out  My customer service rep who sold me the phone didnt do that and wellpretty much lost everything on the SD card  Not the best I really like this phone but its a little hard to get use to the size Sometimes im holding it and dont realize im touching the screen at the top and so my screen isnt doing what i want it to do The phone gets really hot at times and it seems like i drop a lot of calls Just got the Samsung Galaxy 7S  Love the fast charge features It is easy to use once you learn the new android features Going from the 6 to the 7 is not a great difference but I must say I believe the camera on the 6 was a touch better but not to say this one is shabby by any means 

the performance is most likely do to my service But the only complaint I have is the speakerit is much more muted then the 6 I am surprised that Samsung has not figured a better placement for the speakers although I would think with the edge it would be problematic 

The phone being glass means you want to buy a good case not a cheapy but remember the speaker issue  Samsung should design a case that would take care of the speaker problem by directing the bottom speaker when the case it on towards the front but make sure it is not flimsy

Over all I love my Samsungs since I have owned them since they were 1st introduced and it works well with my tab s I love Galaxy phones Now I have the 7 I like that it has a memory card Love the wireless charge I love this phone It has the best camera of any phone Ive ever used I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago my first SmartPhone  It is taking some getting used to but my biggest complaint is the battery needs to be charge every two days and voicemail cant be heard without using data Love the features of this phone specially the camera and for being water resistant So far this has been the best phone I have ever owned I have previously owned the S4 ans S5 and this beats both hands down I love the look and feel of this phone Battery life is astounding I use my phone all day long and I have been able to skip a day of charging before it goes dead 

I can see the screen even in bright light this phone is amazing

I also love playing with the Gear VR that expands the uses for this phone tremendously Though the phone gets hot while using it it doesnt seem to effect its performance afterwards The VR doesnt seem to kill the battery any quicker than if you were just playng a game with the screen on 

With the progression of improvement with each new version I am a Galaxy owner for LIFE i can even text with wet fingers The camera takes great shots too The smartphones have come along way over the past few years and Samsungs S7 Edge is at the top of the group I bought this phone a month ago  Was an apple iphone user  but really glad I switched to Samsung galaxyS7 Had to learn new setup but overall great phone great pictures great quality I love the way of my new Samsung Galaxy S7 works and the graphics are fantastic The phone is very easy to access great to sync all your social media together for easy access Camera is very good easy to use and has awesome features that you will enjoy My data usage skyrocketed and I had to do a lot of research to figure out why  I also had to shut off a lot of features notifications etc etc   In only a few days nearly half my data was used up  Normally with my S5 it took all month to even get close to using it up

Some features are more hidden

I HATE that I have to push a side button to take a picture instead of just tapping the screen 

Would like the phone to be larger as well

Google interface is changed and less user friendly  data hog Ive had this phone for a few months easy set up I like the quick charge feature but the actual phone reception is not that great with my Samsung SG3mini I had great reception from work all the way home with this one I get spotty reception where the person Im talking tells me I sound like Im under water or cant hear me at all also I could sit in my living room with my old phone or walk out to the sidewalk in front of my house and stay connected to my wifiwith this phone I lose my wifi reception sitting on my couch and there is no way Im keeping it to the sidewalk in front of my housepictures look great phone work great other than that My husband actually came home with this phone for me We have traded phones for the past 6 years He gives me the new one and he gets the old one so sweet I started with a Galaxzy 3 then 5 and now 7 It has been the perfect progression for me and then Im able to give my husband my knowledge about his new phone Great phone and beautiful to boot Easy transition from my S5 The camera is much clearer Samsung finally got this one right Waterproof one of the best cameras ever on a phone beautiful display edge is AWESOME and its super fast I had a Note 4 previously and this phone is the perfect size I will always own an edge phone from this moment on I must say I am an absolute fan of Samsung Phones and Tablets For example my wife and I have one of each Recently I switched carriers and allowed them to talk me into a different phone I wont mention any names but the initials start with an M Both my wife and myself were very very unhappy with that other companys phone In my case it was so bad that after just 2 months struggling with that phone I paid my way out of the contract AND CAME BACK TO MY SAMSUNG PHONE The Galaxy S7 is a wonderful phone both in style and functionality Love love the improved fingerprint feature  first time everytime I always lock my phone so it is especially useful for me no more punching in a password It takes advantage of useful google features while avoiding the less functional and replacing them with something that works better Im a happy phoner now I am a loyal Samsung owner I went from a Galaxy Zoom 4 phone which died after nearly 2 years to this Galaxy S7 Im very pleased with the phone and camera My hands are small so I didnt opt for the Edge versionsince its larger Im very pleased with this new phone Great phonewater resistant Ive had it just over a week now and I love it Overall the phone is great but one feature I havent been able to get used to is repeat notification of text messages My Galaxy 5 had the ability to repeat notifications of text messages which if I missed the first notification I would be reminded until I viewed message Other than this the phone works great and am very satisfied Absolutely amazing phone best Ive ever had I love the finger print to access your phone it saves a lot of time and very accurate I am sure there are many more features I havent even explored For the money it doesnt have a lot of the optionsame the s5 I had did and it seems less user friendly The everything phone is easy to use and and everything you need and then some I love the big screen and curved edges However 2 weeks after I got the phone the screen cracked Its so tiny and needs a case at all times I absolutely love ALMOST everything about the Samsung S7 The camera is SO awesome The size is perfect for me It is speedy and responsive when I use it to play games The biggest disappointment for me is the battery life I did some online research of reviews of this product and talked to Samsung employees that work at the store where I purchased the phone several times before purchasing I must not have looked at enough reviews or asked the right people because after I bought it and figured out the battery was not what I had hoped I looked at more reviews and others are not thrilled with the battery life either I had a Samsung S3 and the battery would last over 16 hours when I did normal things like use the phone text check Facebook and play some games during the day Today my Samsung S7 was going to be out of charge after 11 hours after very normal use mostly to make some phone calls and check Facebook The quick charging helps but I am concerned that I am going to be in situations where I will not be on vacation and will not be able to charge it when I need it the most I suppose my next investment will be a wireless rechargeable case for vacation But  overall  I love the phone itself Lite weight great design love the color great picture taking options apps designs better functionality Would recommend this high quality phone Mu husband got one too Love the phone Ive been a loyal samsung user for a long time and for good reason I prefer the edge bar from the note edge though it seemed to be a smoother edge transition and didnt interfere with use of the phone when it was in use When you swipe the edge on this model it takes up half the screen The Note Edge edge bar was less intrusive I love my new Samsung 7 edge this will be the first time that I have paid more than a buck for a phone I love the fact that if it falls in water you have 30 second to get it out and it still works I feel that I have brought myself the best gift ever Also the pictures comes out great I went from IPhone to Galaxy S7 because my wife had one and the reviews Im happy with the phone but of course it is different Glad that I have a good teacher Im learning a lot very quickly I have never been happier with a phone than I am with my S7 edge Itsounds IP68 water resistance makes life easier I can double press my home button to quick launch my camera auto focus in 3 seconds and catch amazing photos of my cats and kids that Ive never been able to before Those pictures would have been blurry on other phones The battery life is AMAZING I love my phone Let me start off by saying wow what a great phone Its super fast beautiful resolution The best camera that has ever came out for a phone Better then alot of actual cameras Screen size is perfect not to small not to big The game launcer is fantasic absolutely love love love it This phone is the best thing since sliced bread Great phone
I like samsung Upgraded early and so glad I did Picture is so clear By far best android I have had and I have had many android phones in the past Glad I did the upgrade This phone looks and feels great Easy to get going and plenty of tutorialshelp to learn how to use all features There is so much that comes on the phone plus hundreds if not thousands of apps to add on to further enjoy from learning to playing to personal productivity Have only had it for little over a week and  couldnt be happier Great phone for what I need to do on a daily basis This is my first Android phone having switched from my Windows phone I do love features on the Windows phone but this new Samsung equaled those and then some Great keyboard layout with symbols and numbers together for easy password entry  text messages that drop down to show you the code needed to enter a site  side bar for most used apps  just name 3 Faster than any phone Ive had I am totally pleases by the phone and the operating system Bravo for an excellent phone and thank you as well I am very pleased with my S7 only had it two weeks now Pictures and videos needs to be made easier to transfer to a computer When I plugged my old Samsung 6 into laptop it would show everything even on the SD card and was very easy to transfer to the laptop I had to call Samsung support was on the phone for a hour and they had to take over my laptop and phone to show the pictures that I took on vacation A few days later I wanted to download new pictures off my phone and when I plugged it in it was the same thing Computer shows the phone connected to the laptop but does not show anything on the phone VERY frustrating Out of all the phones Ive ever owned Galaxy is by far the best brand Ive ever owned I switched from my Galaxy 5 to my Galaxy 7 recently and I LOVE IT It has the removable SD card again looks great has all the features that I love and the camera is AMAZING If a camera is important to you in a phone this is the phone for you Some nice features on the phone itself but very disappointing battery life on my device I use it for roughly a TOTAL of 20 minutes each day while at work and by the time I get home its at 20 IF IM LUCKY It seems that no amount of closing tasks helps This phone is amazing I had the galaxy s4 before getting the galaxy s7 and I am so happy I finally upgraded My battery life lasts all day its easy to use and it looks amazing Very happy with it This has got to be the best Samsung phone Ive ever owned It handles all my applications and photo taking with ease The water resistance is just a bonus in this extremely good looking package The only downside is how warm this phone can get But thats easily fixable with a good case Love my Samsung Galaxy this is my 3rd one and the best by far This phone is fantastic It is fast and most importantly the battery lasts me all day The water resistance and micro SD slot are great features as well I love the added features to the Samsung Galaxy line up but I dont like you all took the ability to add a signature to your text Its a small feature but Ive had that for yrs and yrs thats how people identify me that I hadnt spoke to in a long time  things of that nature Thats the only thing I dont like Great phone just need better focus for close up pictures Really easy to use It has great features and it looks awesome Was a gift and I love it Have had it for almost 2 weeks and love it The sales person was so good and knowledgeable Took no time at all to get hooked up and started with my new phone I bought this June 1st and so far I am enjoying it  It probably has way more features than I need but I am having fun with it Switched from the Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy S7 several weeks ago  Phone is much faster picture qualityspeedoptions are much better  I was amazed at the quality of low light pictures  Phone can handle multiple apps at once without slowing down or crashing  Battery last all day even with heavy usage  Highly recommend When ever I play my favorite game on the S7 it will close out my game for no reason a lot and also it has some lag when it comes to the phone over all This phone is a huge step up from my LG G2 Wow I just love it It is hard to get use to pushing a button instead of double tapping the screen Lol I just received phone last Friday and instructions was easy to understand Pictures are very clear Overall a very good phone I wish the headphone jack was a the top instead of the bottom and I wish the back came off for a battery pull if necessary But its very easy to use and customize Good screen quality and ease of use I would definitely recommend to anyone mop I definitely dont regret getting this phone it will save me money in the long I always get my phones wet and buy another one now say good bye to that Great features Ive only had my phone for 1 12 weeks and am still learning Workshops are very helpful The combination of Verizon  Samsung are the best of both worlds Coverage  speed love it in general good battery power and longevity However Google does not sync well Went back to the store and the said verizon is aware of the sync issues and an update will be pushed out Hope its soon I selected this phone much in part due the the google integration and sync capabilities Ive had many phones over the years This phone is by the far the best Its possible I wont even buy the s8 when it comes out because Im loving this phone too much Great job Samsung making a bad to the bone phone aka Galaxy S7 edge The edge display makes using your phone quicker Great colors on the screen Amazing 4k video quality I couldnt ask for a better phone I will definitely stick with the the galaxy s line I love how easy it is to navigate through all of the features Best phoneI have ever owned Battery life is good Camera is very good This smartphone is so easy to use that I am delighted and wish us had got it sooner I absolutely love the camera on my phone It is amazing I just switched from iPhone to galaxy and Im in love No more iPhone for me I notice for no reason every once in awhile the battery drains more then usual also If its in my pocket while Im outside for awhile and then pull it out its warm and sluggish Another thing is sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesnt when people call I really like the phone and the features Still have more exploring to do First off the price is ridiculous If I wasnt required to have a phone for work I would have tried to find something cheaper online but the immediacy of the situation wouldnt allow me The glass back feature isnt exactly what I was wanting either It makes no sense to spend a huge amount of money on a phone only to have it not very durable Due to this feature and fear of breaking it I was obligated to buy an otterbox for it I like this product because the design is excellent I like the size the camera and many more Just got it less than a week ago Performs better than the previous phone Would be great if there was an intuitive introduction to the product and its features Seems I have to search it out for myself Love the look Professional smart and stylish Still learning the many many features that are so useful on a daily basis Appears to be user friendly I wish I was as smart as this phone I love the Galaxy s7 it is an amazing phone it is really fast Phone is easy to use and has great features This device has plenty of perks It comes with a whole slew of features that I have yet to fully discover and make full use of One of the few that I love is the screen split between virtually any application I do feel like the speakers were thrown in an as an afterthought because they have a very easy ability to be muffled only had it a week like it so far I previously owned the S3 and then the Note3 before moving to S7 edge I have no issues with it It is only a bit smaller than the note3 which was a tad wide to put into some back pockets anyway for transport The curved screen is very attractive and I found that I appreciate the visual affect it has when scrolling different screens It feels more natural and realistic to see the the next screen coming around from the side like a physical carousel The resources given to the UI likely help with this I have yet to play with the edge menu Ive popped it out on accident a few times but once I learned its placement it doesnt happen anymore 

When I was searching for a new phone the selling point was firstly the expansion slot which is not present on the Note5 Lets face it cellphones are not just phones anymore Have I even placed a call on mine yet That being said I need something that can do the most and frankly just about any phone can as long as you have room on it I can definitely take or leave the Spen so that wasnt stopping me

A Keep making phones with expandable storage
B Keep making phones with physical buttons Some would disagree but I want MORE buttons Why isnt the camera launch a physical button I think its used often enough to warrant it Because Im greedy also add another configurable button for whatever app you always use I do like that the double tap opens the camera however I still would prefer a physical button dedicated to this Think about what we use our phones for PhoneCameraOther Apps Camera stands out and is an important feature when folks are choosing their next phone Do folks even own an actual camera anymore If you like it put a button on it The Galaxy S7 is a solid phone on all levels Best phone on the market by far I love this cellphone before I had the Samsung Galaxy 5 I in love with this cellphone I recommend to everyone The best phone I have ever owned reliable and fun Overall I like this phone so far I went from a S4 to this  so getting used to the way features are setup takes some getting used to The picture clarity isnt as good as I had hoped but its still better than what I had Battery life like any phone depends on how much you use it Before getting my gs7 I had an iPhone 4 for about 3 years This is a huge change but I am pretty familiar with android so it hasnt been too difficult to learn new things I can do with the software I am amazed with the camera so far I work with animals every day and when I needwant a picture I can snap tons in a matter of seconds and they are all crystal clear I still have to do some more reading to learn all the settings and features for the camera but I am so pleased that the possibilities are truly endless with what this phone can do The hand gestures for the screen are pretty cool too I am super pleased with my phone This is fast and sleek The storage alone makes it nice but the ability to also have a sd card is even better I purchased this phone because I lost my old one glad I did like the phone a lot easy to use It is a good phone Easy to use Takes good pictures and the screen is clear Camera is easy to use Videos play well and games are clear when playing Built solid Smooth design Easy one hand operation Fast charging long battery life So far so good galaxy s7 Graphics are excellent Every thing is very clear and easy to read My one complaint so far is that I cant always answer a call coming in Sometimes it says to answer call or ignore Other times that does not come up Although a few things changed from the Note II I have found this phone to perform excellently I am thrilled with the size the weight and the speed Outstanding performance overall Sharpclear viseals Clear sound including cell phone I enjoyed the ease of taking pictures and posting theseThere seems to be a problem in clarity while in shadows This is still a great phone I like how you can organize your picturesThe way you can maximize your photos is excellentThe amount of free amps are wonderful
 My old phone was over 5 years old  a Droid Incredible HTC I now have the Samsung S7  a great upgrade I didnt realize how great it would be to go from 3G to 4G I should have done this a long time ago This phone puts everything else to shame You have to take it for a test drive and you wont be able to put it down Incredible speed camera and features all around The speaker is on the bottom edge instead of the back so I can easily hear the other person while the phone is lying flat Also exceptional camera Features I like and why

An amazing experience Bought one week ago great I love everything about this phone and how easy it was to switch service and phones This was the first time that I didnt have to go into a store after switching to straighten things out None of that headache this was a flawless transition Two weeks in and zero issues Quick and easy to use I love the ease of use of this phone I love the way I am able to customize the phone I can take notes for a specific contact and add to my calendar at the same time I know the Edge is pricey but leaves NOTHING to the imagination I am 79 years and semi computercellphone literate So far I have not had to seek help from the pros Would recommend the Edge to all So far Im pleased with the S7 Satisfied very much with the S7 Love this phone Durable and has upgraded features from my previous galaxy bought it 1 week ago because i based my IPhone Just got it a week ago and Im happy I decided to upgrade The pictures are great memory capacity processor speed Great phone I switched over from a iPhone 5s to the Samsung S7 Edge and I cant be more satisfied I use the edge screen more often than I expected and overall a great phone Its a really good phone Beautiful great features fast but the only thing way better than the s6 is the battery The battery is way better There are a few flaws with the normal s7 First of all the speaker is on the bottom and I end up covering it with my finger constantly its just a really bad place The finger Print scanner is way to sensitive its made to make life easier but sometimes it makes it even harder to get in your phone constantly saying not matched The scanner button also gets scratched really easily and the phone as a whole is very slippery But other than those physical features there is nothing else to complain about Runs very well even when a lot of space is used works great in all vr machines not just gear great resolution and from how many times I accidently dropped this phone Im happy to report pretty durable still no scratches other than the home button My iPhone stopped working so I was overnighted a new one as replacement except it was completely defective So I traded in the broken phone you so mailed me for a new galaxy No regrets so far This phone is a great piece of technology Clear callsfast processorsd card portand a tremendous camera I finally upgraded from my S3 to this wonderful S7 I choose the black model It is the most beautiful one I believe because of satin cats eye deep onyx high gloss it is gorgeous I am very impressed with the speed and quality of this phone and Samsung for making something so useful and easy to understand The pictures this phone takes is amazing so bright and crystal clear and the music quality of the internal player is top shelf quality 
 I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone
I dont think any phone can get much better than this no matter how good they make it look Great quality product Takes great pictures Sound quality and display is awesome I replaced my S6 with the S7 and they are very similar in fact it fit in my old case Great phone great company highly recommend it Nice edge  fast durable  Many choise of android better than iOS  Great phone Ive always loved samsung because they put out reliable user friendly phones Several other phones from companies which I will leave to your imagination and nothing compares

My last Galaxy was the S5 and I figured I would keep the tradition going Everything has improved 
Battery life is 25 times better at least 
The processor keeps everything running smooth even if I forget to close all of my apps 
The camera has high quality photos which keeps me occupied on social media 
32 gigabytes keeps my phone open for so many possibilities and the ability to add more is awesome 

Only downsides are the flip board screen and the lack of ability to send multiple HQ photos via text and I prefer keeping Google Chrome tabs in the app not as app tabs 

Overall best phone I could ask for Oh and it sank in a sink full of dishes and Im using it to right this review Need I say more Great phone its super fast has an awesome camera water proof great reception and signal I love everything about it amazing color and screen so life like I love my new S7 it works really well and I love it the experience in a car with a line in is subpar compared to my Galaxy Note II I had previously  I may have to get it looked at Dont know why I waited so long  Feature are far and above the S3  The changes are easy to adapt to I have had this phone for a month now and it is great The camera works well it is fast and the battery lasts all day Very happy with my choice so far got the new s7 because my daughter got one to Responsivesolid feelJust hoped the back was a little more ruggedshattered back case on 4 drop
Otherwise happy with this phone I really like this phone so far  Just wish all my apps would transfer so I dont have to remember them all and reload them My only  true problem  is its so fragile  My daughters phone cracked right away the first time it fell Very upsetting I went up to the s7 from the s3 and Im so happy that I did This phone is so incredible I have been setting it up for a day and still havent set up everything thats available Its easy to use I love that I can download themes for it Its sleek and sexy I couldnt ask for a better phone Awesome love the S7 edge fantastic features highly recommend I love how the phone has the corning gorilla glass 4 and a very smooth interface Its very easy to use and has everything I would need in a daily phone I also have the wireless fast charger which has proven quite beneficial in my office setting It makes it easier to read any messages and notifications while getting a very fast charge Broke it in 4 days  Cant withstand a 1 foot fall  Youd think something that costs this much would be at least a little durable  Until you put an aftermarket case on it  its basically like carrying an egg around Excellent service and coverage I bought my new phone last weekend and wished I did it sooner I love it I like how the speaker is at the bottom of the phone now I also like how the charge port is different It doesnt have that flap that broke off of my old phone An amazing phone Beautifully  made and fast The S7edge is exactly what my wife and I have been searching for And its sleek design makes it easier to handle and transport Combine with the excellent service provider ATT Its a win win combination Samsung has outdone itself You have raised the bar to a level that cant be matched let alone beat Thank you I love everything there is to love about this phone The Edge runs fast and is a great phone I love the Samsung S7 Fist off I have been a long time Samsung fan I have a number of Samsung electronics in my house so I am no stranger to the quality of product they put out This is my second Samsung phone and my wife has had 5 or 6 in her life time as well 

I switched back to an Android product from an IOS unit due to the customization aspect on the Android over the IOS I was super excited to get this phone with all the reviews I had read online Once I got it home it took a little getting use to as far as the setting and where everything was This didnt take long and I was up and going in no time

After several days of using it I noticed the WIFI wasnt anywhere near as great as it was on my previous Galaxy nor my most recent iPhone6 The speed of the wifi on this phone is lack luster and definitely does not impress I hope there is a fix for this soon but I have to disconnect my wifi to get anything done at all Yet on my LG Tablet iPad iPad Mini Galaxy S4 Galaxy S3 or Galaxy S5 the wifi seems to work just fine 

Other than the wifi issues the phone is pretty great and the water proofing pretty much sold it for me Glad I bought it  I have enjoyed it so far As an older Baby boomer I put off getting a smart phone as long as I could Finally the children and grandchildren won out and I broke down and got one To start with the name smart phone is correct as it is smarter than I am It did take a few days of hittingtouching the wrong places to get a hang of things and after a month I feel comfortable making a call sending a text and reading my email Have taken a few pictures and sent them via email need to work on that I still do not know why many seem to constantly look at the blasted thing Thank goodness I have not reached that point I go on the internet very little as my eyes are not as good as they once were
Now the question is what do I think of it Wow what a wonderful machine it will do much more than I have figured out how to do I love it but doubt that I will ever use it to its full capability According to those in the know I purchased a top of the line phone sometimes Lady Luck taps you on the head I went from a galaxy s4 to the s7 and its a major improvement The picture quality and video is amazing The little things are a plus to like the HD calling video calling and voicemail Many many more Ive been with Samsung since the s4 Ive never left because their cameras and screens are powerful and sharp This phone has it all Keep it up Samsung This phone has all the features that a person could ask for It is the latest and greatest and I do not know how anyone will top what this phone has love this phone its fast and battery last forever and a day lol This phone is fantastic takes great pictures and I love that I can add a memory card this phone also has great battery life Camera is great phone is big enough to see well but isnt huge Ive had nothing but samsung for the past 8 years the operating system is so easy for those of us that arent that intelligent with electronics thank you another great product one happy customer I bought this phone for my sons birthday he loves it The fact that I can reach him when I need to is important to me To my son it was an avenue of freedom With the  ability to use it for information texting school work gaming and of course talking he is now connected Samsung has come out with another great product Had an s4 for a while and decided to upgrade I love the camera the amount of internal memory and how easy it was to switch phones Still exploring all the features A great phone overall Has every thing i need and is very customizable Prior to my Galaxy S7 I owned a different companys flagship It was a great phone but had its issues and I was thrilled by the improvements I gained with the S7 The camera quality modes especially Pro mode features and ease of use are outstanding I have long been waiting for a camera that allows me to change the exposure time and ISO and the S7 delivers The only qualms I have about the camera is that the slomotion is subpar compared to the iPear It doesnt have 240 FPS and the video is slightly darker than it should be Sometimes it skips frames too Additionally the frontfacing camera does not focus on my face or other objects The closer I get the less out of focus it becomes Even my iPod Touch 4th generation from seven years ago could focus better than mine After doing some research it appears that other S7 users are experiencing this while others are not The performance of this phone is similar to most highend flagship phones Theyre all extremely fast Even in Power Saving Mode another great feature most games and apps still run smoothly and multitasking takes a minimal hit I could go on and on about every feature I love in this phone but I am not trying to write a multipage review The display is fantastic the features the customization the water and dust resistance and just about everything else Samsung was wise to add the SD card back to the design and I will likely not buy their next few flagships if they get rid of the SD card slot again Also Samsung makes SD cards which I use and I highly recommend so to create their devices with the inability to use their own SD cards is insane Another issue I ran into was that Android OS uses excessive amounts of data even after disabling GPS location sync background data for all Google apps and restricting background data It used almost 500 MB of background data in a period of a week after my data reset Also there is no Restrict Background Data option after choosing Data Usage and tapping on an app you wish to restrict background data for I have the S7 a friend of mine who owns the S7 Edge had this option in their settings That could be because my device is on US Cellular I am not sure I dont want to end on a sour note so despite this phones flaws it is still the best device you can get right now You can use it anywhere even next to a waterfall and not worry about it getting damaged I still recommend a case of course it looks great feels great in your hand has very few issues and altogether puts the iPhone to shame The qualms I do have are nothing compared to the wonderful features of this device It is the epitome of the smartphone for 2016 Glad I bypassed the S6I loved my S5 and the S7 is even better faster prettier I bought this a week ago and I am so glad I did Super happy Had a gs5 Many great new features Battery life is great compared to my gs5 that was 2 years old  Camera is amazing I have had both a iPhone and samsung And out of all I really enjoy the s7 edge it is more functional than any other phone Operates so much faster and smoother than my old S5 I do miss having a removable battery but allinall I love my s7 I love this phonedoesnt have all the added apps that I never use I had a note 4 prior so the size is taking some getting used to but overall a great phone I preordered my Galaxy s7 and Im very pleased with it I upgraded from a Galaxy s5 so the learning curve wasnt a issue at all It has a beautiful display ando a much better camera than my s5 not that I ever complained about it I like the always on display two I have great battery life as well Just got my phone last week and quickly learned the new features compared to my old LG This phone is so much easier to use with all my apps in one place This phone does more than I could imagine using Just trying to learn the basics seems overwhelming at times I love the size design and overall feel of the phone 
My only complaint would be the cost all smart phones and the little things that pop up here and there notifying me that some function has stopped working I still have not had anyone tell me what Samsung Link is or why it keeps stopping I bought the new S7 about ten days ago and I am regretting it Everyone else in my house has iPhones and they have great reception I do not Dont like this phone nearly as much as my old S6 Edge Plus Great phone easy to get around  beautifully crafted This phone definitely is the best in performance Love the smooth design and bright display My only complaint was that I was a little disappointed in Samsung dropping the infrared sensor for the remote Always loved having that as a backup if I misplaced my remotes Outstanding quality you can always expect from Samsung Honestly if I could rate this lower than a 1 star I would I personally do not like this phone It completely freezes whenever someone texts me and Im trying to respond to them Its always dropping calls or losing some type of connection Im constantly having to manually restart it for it to even work properly on several occasions I havent gotten any calls or texts the only thing that worked was my Facebook messenger for some reason The battery life is also bad for me even with power saver mode on Ive taken pictures and they havent even saved on my phone which is extremely annoying  I personally dont care for this phone It has been nothing but bad for me Will definitely be switching back to a Motorola phone Extremely disappointed I upgraded from a Samsung S4 which I loved It is the S4 with some better quailtiesand a couple that I miss
I Like
the bright vibrant display
the Always on Display
the different themes I can choose from
the camera takes great pics and videos
Samsung Pay is awesome
battery life is pretty good but it charges super fast
The processor is faster


The couple things I miss
The IR blaster
The removable battery

I dont like
Cant get the SD card to be recognized
Should be 64gb base model
The speaker could be better Use headphones or BT speaker Nice phone but very sensitive and the curved screen is dangerous You have a higher chance of breaking the glass with the curve Wish I had just bought the 7s I like my new phone  Its great phone never expected for it to be that great especially the water resistant great pictures underwater the elegant look in the fast respond just love it thanks Samsung I am so impressed with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 The learning curve was very small  its very easy to navigate and has wonderful response time for all apps that Ive tried I am definitely a fan I always was a competitor customer but made the conclusion that it is no longer innovating technology just looking for how to make profit I bought the S7 Edge The S7 Edge has a large screen the screen resolution is great if there is a need for more storage jut buy and install a memory card instead of having to buy another phone with more Gb The camera is spectacular it is waterproof it performs faster than others you can add your favorite applications to the edge of the screen for fast and easy finding one of the music applications allows you to download music for free and with others you need to subscribe and pay it has live technical support to access you phone In short SAMSUNG develops new technology and services to benefit the pocket of the customer Other competitors have slowed down the developing of new technology and developed more ways to get more money from customers The S7 Edge is the current best cell phone in the market Bought it 1 week ago I like it but wish I knew all the features this has and how to work them I guess the only complaint I have is the ring tones theyre not that great need better ones After rushing out and getting the galaxys4 I didnt think there was room in my life for anything else Then she got tired and her face cracked and I had to move on This phone is everything I dreamed of and more It fits in my pocket there was no awkardness of getting used to a new phone Everything transfered over quickly from my old phone The camera is beautiful and now my fancy dslr sits at home because I dont need anything else and my son fears that I am going to download snapchat I am very impressed and satisfied with my Samsung S7 A perfect phone for a professional always on the move Very stylish easy to access smooth curves very reliable secure integrates very well with Samsung Gear watch health features I love everything about my Samsung S7 phones Since we changed from a flip phone to the smart phone its been an uphill learning curve and not one that has been easy   Dont really understand all the apps and even how to answer the phone is difficult   Other than the 23rds that we still need to work on to use the phone properly its a good phone    It will probably take us a longer while since we are not tech savy people Very nice phone with excellent features and performance along with ease of use I love the design of the S7 edge as there is no phone like it SAMSUNG has always provided me with the best quality pictures and apps I will never buy any other brand of phone and I always recommend SAMSUNG S7 and any other SAMSUNG product to everyone I bought this a week ago and I am pleased that it lasts a little longer battery wise than my last Samsung The Galaxy S7 Edge is an outstanding phone Definitely the most technologically advanced phone to date Amazing screen including curved edge and awesome features make this the best Android phone on the market This product has great features Easy to use and great performance as well I will surely recommend this to other members of my family This device has many great features I love that OK Google can call or text when I ask Switched from iPhone 6 plus to the s7 edge So far I have really liked everything about this phone more Its so much easier to customize for your own personal needs The camera is really awesome I love the edge screen and graphics too Best phone I ever had I love it Perfect for everything I needed it for I would have to say overall the waterproof feature is pretty great other than the speakers being distorted for a couple hours until the phone completely dried out Im still weary of actually submerging my s7 edge in water Im afraid of there being permanent damage if something like that were to occur I love this phone easy to use and lots of storage Easily the best phone Ive ever owned No shortcomings This is perfection in a phone Fast Smooth Elegant No drawbacks One of Samsungs best phones This phone offers so many features no other phone in its market offers I am able to play a song on you tube and still respond to text Download while Im talking on the phone and still surf social media Sharing attachments are sooo much easier on this phone I love the quality photo it gives but it limits you too how many photos you can share via text email and social media You can view 1440p you tube videos and dont even think about buffering The bright QHD AMOLED display Intensifies EVERY application on your phone They have a host of amazing themes to choose from to completely change the experience of your phone The heart rate monitor and step counter is one of the most accurate Ive come in contact with And the extensive camera modes that are available helps capture the perfect photo at the right moment I also love the always on screen It is not only the most helpful but so very professional Extremely loud speaker in and out of conversation The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a beautiful premium mobile phone It is fast has all of the wonderful customization Android is known for The theme store app lets you add different themes to customize your phone Always on display can act as an digital clock so you can see the time and the notifications without waking up the phone Comes with Android Marshmallow expandable storage it is water resistant and has great battery life The hardware design feels good in your hand Overall great phone Is a good phone just a few minor problems Battery is not all that great camera freezes sometimes and when listening to music on auxiliary cord has static I had the GSIII for a couple of years then decided to get the iPhone 6 after awhile I was bored to death and waited for this GS7 and glad I did I missed my GS3 and after reading the great reviews for the Edge decided to purchase and glad I did sharp looking and still learning something new every day Thank you Samsung for a great and fun product I bought this last week and so far so good I love all the features in this model especially the ability to schedule a text My only problem is that sometimes the phone is slow and gets stuck in messaging Better than the s6 Has a better battery life and better camera quality This is my first smart phone and I love it It has been so easy to figure out and there are so many things I can do with it I may never finish discovering new things to love about this phone It is also a beautiful phone sleek and easy to hold I was afraid it might be too big but it doesnt seem to be The images are crisp and clear and the sound quality is excellent Did I mention I love this phone I am glad that I finally took the plunge and got a smart phone I am also glad I was smart enough to pick this one I cant find one negative about the S7 OR the S7 Edge  I have them both on different lines Anyway whatever was wrong with the S6 has been made right in the S7 The weak battery lifebetter the processing speedbetter picture qualitybetter and I could go on The transition from my Galazy S4 to the S7 was flawless and pain free All my stuff got migrated over without a problem And best of all the Galazy S7 improved on so many areas power speed connectivity features and the camera  wow There isnt a thing about this phone I dont love New phone easy to use I love the sleek design of this phone and all the features that come with it 
The only downfall is the back is made out of cheap glass I shattered it not even 24 hours after purchasing Maybe next time use a thicker unbreakable glass cover this is my third samsung phone each one better then the other the pictures are clear the edge feature is great its easy to use I really like this phone Upgraded to the Galaxy 7 Edge LOVE it The extra GB space holding a sim card just amazing I was delighted that I was able to get Verizon service and the new Galaxy S7they seem to keep out doing themselves each time I really like my S7Edge and would recommend it to a friend or family member I upgraded from the galaxy s5 and am finding so many features that I love that werent on the 5 I had a Galaxy S5 which was great but the S7 outshines it in every way The screen is really wonderful It can be read in bright sunlight I cant believe how good the camera is The pictures it takes are unbelievably sharp I dont find anything about the phone that Im not more than pleased with I love my new galaxy s7 My favorite part of this phone is how quickly it charges and how long my battery Also the double tapping on home button to get my camera open is awsome because I have 3 kids and sometimes I dont catch their quirkiness quick enough because of having to wait to open the camera This phone is so easy to use and I brag to all my friends Everythings working so far I think this phone is the best so far The pictures especially now I can take pictures on moving objects for sports and entertainment I like this phone I recently updated it I am disappointed that I cannot go International with it Otherwise a nice piece I picked up this phone because its the newest galaxy phone currently and its biggest draw for me was the SD card I am used to the Note series so I thought this would fit the bill 
 Fast software hardware and water resistance is great The only issue I had was the edge desig itself I found it too easy to accidently activate things due to having large hands I highly recommend this phone though I did go back to the Note 5 as it fits my lifestyle better Ive owned a galaxy S3 S5 and now the Galaxy S7 I do like the features included and the speed the OS runs It seems to process every task immediately with no pause or lag time All in all I am very pleased with my new phone This phone is fast It processes commands instantly Awesome features and battery life Great performance Only wishes are that a equivalent battery was in the standard s7 vice only s7 edge and that they return the IR blaster I used it all the time The camera is phenomenal too Really astounded with the pictures it takes Glad they brought back the expandable memory too This was an upgrade for me and Im enjoying this phone Never had a group text option so thats fun Very user friendly I love the camera on this phone fast and great pictures its very durable with all the drops me and the kids do So far I am very please with all items on the phone I did expect the battery to be better but as time goes by  I dont play as much maybe will last longer I did have an iPhone before but then I switched to Samsung and it was the best decision of my life Great features but flawed with over heating and virus updates other wise I love the phone Didnt get a real good phone guideBut overall great phone easy to use easy to get used to Extremely satisfied with the phone features display speed  ease of use Second Samsung Ive owned and its head  shoulders above the S4 I have had it a week and to be honest I prefer my iphone 6 to this galaxy s7 except for the battery life The iphone is much easier to navigate imo Great upgrade from our old SIIIs  Keys are much easier and crisper pictures even more wonderful  Size of keyboard makes use nice  We love them  Friendlier to use Best phone Ive ever owned user friendly lots of customization options very intuitive great battery life I love my galaxy s7 Much faster and smoother than my old gs5 Still has a sd card slot which is why i didnt get the gs6 Semi waterproof which helps keep dust out as well which is great for my line of work welder My olny gripe on the entire phones isnthat there is no wiget for the flashlight on the phone Its on the notification drawer But other than that I love it If you ever wanted a smartphone that did almost everything you wanted one to do then this is the one for you Video phone NFC printing NFC paying with SamsungAndroid pay I could go on and on but you should get the drift  And this is from a 70 yr old man I like the phone and its better than the alternatives but I have the same issues as with my S3 The surface without a case which I prefer isnt tacky enough to have adequate control of its buttons When I pick the phone up for a call I often hit a button and sometimes even hang up on someone I think the buttons need to be somehow recessed and accessible when intentionally pushed or moved somewhere else to avoid inadvertent pushing
Other than that I love the phone The screen is awesome All the apps I copied over work better I also have a Gear VR so Im enjoying that 
All in all apart from the control surfaces the best phone out Love it Perfect size Super fast Pictures are magnificent This phone has been easy to understand and where we needed help we found many sources available including the 6 year old up the street just kidding about that  This phone is fast clear voice and pictures and ergonomically feels like its part of me As much as I hear about the galaxy phones I expected it to blow my mind specially since I switched over from iPhone and due to the lack of expectations realized Ill more likely switch back to iphone I love everything about my new S7 Ive been a Samsung Galaxy fan for a long time I traded a Note 4 for the S7 in order to be a bit more compact and get newer and upgraded features The S7 is just the right size and delivers on every feature Its fast The battery life is strong The camera is just incredible I cant imagine anything better Cant wait to pair my new Gear S2 watch with it when it arrives This phone has a lot of features easy to use and nice to look at Ive had this phone about 3 weeks and have already shattered the glass back  I bumped it on a chair while in my pocket My S5  no case was dropped several times with no problems I dont like cases but this phone is so fragile a case is needed  Dont know why they would put a glass back on Nice phone should come with case if they are going to make it so fragile I traded in a iPhone 6 for this one and it beats iPhone 6 by 100 I love this phone Awesome all around I will always use Samsung from here on out I love the S7 
Fast pretty good battery life beautiful screen
My only wish is that the antenna was a bit better I love my new phone Works great and easy to navigate Beautiful curved edges and great features this product is perfect in every way Ive had this phone a week and I love it I switched from the iPhone to this I was looking forward to switching for a while The only feature I miss from my iPhone is the way the calendar displays From what I hear the calendar on the s5 was much more convenient for people whom depend on the calendar Have owned phone for three wks now and really enjoy using it I have been with the Samsung Family for the last 46 years I had the S5 and my dad has the S6 I just got the S7 and am loving the phone

It works great has all the features I would need I am not a techie so I do not know all the phone can dobut am working on it

The phone is easy enough for me to get to know and I am slowly using more and more of the options to use it to the full potential Some of the changes from the S5 to the S7 I love Waterproof visual voicemail fingerprint reader Then there are a few things that the S5 did that the S7 does not Specifically in the alarms there used to be a pre alarm that would wake me gently While I know the S7 has an increasing volumenot the same I wish they would bring that back

Otherwise I am very happy with the phone I do not get reception in my own housr Obsessed This phone is awesome Love the galaxy s7  Happy to get away from apples iphone I had to replace my phone very daunting for a senior like me but the transition has been easy I love the new phone I just got in couple weeks ago This is by far the best phone Ive had Love everything about it I have only had it a week but so far so good Great style and very easy to use Really like how fast everything is on the phone Must have it can do so much Very fast and great battery life Cant put it down for two second This phone is a big step up from the s5 I had before the good lock app is kind of agrevateing because I cant turn off the app on lock screen other than that its all thumbs up But is hard to find good accessoriesto fit any function to my needs or wantscolors r great size is light and functional A few problems I have discovered are Its almost impossible to get a screen protector to stay on due to the curved edgesand I have problems getting a cute phone case to fit well Also I have had mine just a few months and the speaker is growling like its busted Amazing Feature and Lightning response I love the phone The waterproof is awesome What can I say but Amazing The screens edge takes a little bit to get used to but well worth it Packed full of features except and IR sensor youll never get tired of your Galaxy S7 edge And when I try to type  it freeze Had the S4 and liked that one The S7 is great water resistant and seems to connect better to wifi and Verizon Only issue the screen protectors were not good Edges of the S7 are slightly curved and the flat protectors didnt stay long Went with just a plastic protector to keep scratches off the screen Awesome phone it has been perfect Ot has handled everything have have thrown at it droping it in the lake spilling things on it droping it on concrete not a scratch on it  Best phone I have had yet I have only had the phone for one week but the ease of handling is great Im not a computer person per say but this phone is very easy to use and learn The features of this phone is easy to use and find I had many galaxies until the S5 then left do to touchwiz This phone is light years ahead especially with the edge It is fast efficient and has great features I would only ask for touchwiz to change a bit in design and conform more to material and less cartoony The S7 is the best phone that Ive ever owned The sleek design is easy to hold ands the screen is beautiful I have been an iPhone user for years but now convinced that Samsung has come up with a superior phone Dropped the phone one time from only knee high and the screen cracked Pricey repair I  more than happy with my new phone Beautiful screen and color I was really nervous about the screen being fragile but now that I have a case on it I feel so much better A friend of mine got the phone at the time I thought the edge was stupid and I asked how he liked it He had switched from am iPhone but he said it was the best phone hed ever used I upgraded from the S5 and I lovethis phone The edge adds screen real estate without making the phone feel huge Although the glass screen protectors not samsungs fault are very poor at this time so if you want to protect your phone you should make sure you are aware of this I even tried the zagg glass curve Phone is made of good materials looks very clean and operates nicely Favorite phone Ive had in a very long time Ive had Samsung smart phones first the last few years and I have to say I have not been disappointed Ive had other phones and thought they were the best then I purchased my first galaxy phone and I was happy with the phone so Ive stayed with Samsung ever since my new Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best Samsung Ive owned to date everything about it is AWESOME the design the UI the improvement to the camera is a feature my wife loves I have to use other products for my job so I have first hand experience with them and I have to say that I would never purchase other products for my personal devices I love my phone I have gone from droid turbo to iPhone to Galaxy s7 This phone is by far my favorite The picture quality is so vibrant and very crisp and there are really cool picture effects you can use The speaker phone on this phone is easy to hear I have to turn it down at time The sound quality on the s7 is excellent What I also love about this phone is the ability to change the appearance and themes I could keep going on and on about the great qualities there really is not limit on this phone This is probably the best Samsung phone I have had so far Its easy to use and is lightning fast I love the color The HD videospictures I love the sound quality Ive always wanted a phone like this This phone is almost flawless except for one flaw where my snapchat keeps crashing I really wish that wouldnt happen anymore thank you overall for creating this phone I LOVE IT regardless even if it has one flaw The battery is wearing out too quickly
I didnt get a secondary battery would like it better if it came with a free gear 2 like my husband got with his I just got the s7 edge recently I love how fast the phone operates and I love the compatibility with all of the apps I frequent I moved up from an S3 to an S7 and love the speed and feel of the phone Ive put on a glass screen protector but Im not sure that its the way to go Im not an iPhone person and never the constraints of an iPhone so Im not a fan of the nonremovable battery or the glass screen protector Id hate to have a shattered screen like all those sheep with iPhones What I do love is all the Samsung performance quality and design that has been built into everything they do from my tablets to my phones laptops and TVs I also appreciate that it was easy to move up from an S3 to an S7 without a huge learning curve Im a Samsung girl I love there products Very good and fun All and all I will always have SAMSUNG I have the newest Samsung Phone and my wife has the newest iPhone my phone blows hers away Im a geeky kinda guy and use to be in charge of our local Government IT Dept so of course Im gonna have the best phone on the market Have been very pleased with the speed and the ease of use  Camera is much better than my last phone This is the 1st Samsung Galaxy cell phone that I havent had to worry about the battery dyingcharge lasts all day When I connect it to the charger it charges super fast I just got my phone on the 18th and for the most part so far so good Only issue I seem to be having is both my Galaxy S7 and my sons new Galaxy S7 phones seem to get hot at times I will be sure to call in and make sure this cant become an issue but at this time its the only minor concern we both have with the phones The features are wonderful and the camera is superb I dont think I will ever want to go without this level of camera abilities again because taking pictures is my life The overall phone graphics are great nice and crisp and very clear Overall pricing good be a lot better this is a completive market and with the awesome service theres room to bring on many more customers by making the service more cost effective for the clients which interns ands more features and lines a customer could afford to have I really enjoy using this phone its really nice phone I got this new phone a couple of weeks ago and it is great It is fast smooth wonderful picture and sound Still getting used to features Love this easy room learn phone Wow what a great phone  replacing an iphone 5 and am super impressed with everything about this phone
All the features are 5 star and work wonderfully  I feel i needed to remove one star due to the battery not lasting as long as the ads play it out to as for the value it seems to be priced along with the other flagship phones from other makers
Got the gear VR a few days latter  you have to try it to understand but now i can see why its the next big thing I Love this phone So many cool new features The Edge is very useful I like that you can have shortcuts for different features like the camera selfie Pretty easy to navigate This phone is easy to use and the camera is excellent I love the ease of the docking station to charge the phone I like the speed of the phone quality of camera  water proff I love this phone Great picture and fast search Overall I am very pleased with the phone I have owned all of the galaxy S series phones The Galaxy S7 is by far the best in all regards except I am very disappointed that it does not have an 
IR Blaster Had I known that it lacked this feature I might not have bought it I am a Traveling IT Systems Administrator for a Major manufacturing industry and ive had this phone for over a month now This phone has been very responsive and durable to suit all of my needs prior to this ive owned the iphone 6s plus and the iphone cannot compare to my galaxy s7 Ive had iPhone and multiple Android phones and this has been by far my favorite phone Super fast tons of features and battery life and Fast Charge are simply fantastic Just upgraded from an S6 edge to the S7 First thing is nice not having to worry about getting it wet Good memory great features I get people asking about the edge features all the time due to the screen edge curving Im very satisfied so far It has the fingerprint scanner and really does work the edge menu is awesome the pictures are automatically focused and so bright even with bad lighting If you color coordinate your most used contacts on your edge menu and have your phone screen down and they text or call then it lights up on the side of the phone their color so you know who it is before looking This phone can be in water This is by far the coolest smartphone Ive owned I was disappointed when I had heard that the S6 had gotten rid of expandable memory and wasnt sure what Id do when it was time to upgrade My husband and I both started looking for info on the S7 as soon as we heard the first rumblings that one would be coming out We both loved our S5 and the expandable memory was a huge thing for me as prior to the S5 I had an iPhone that decided to delete all of my photos instead of backing them up when I was doing my forced update Once it was official expandable memory was back and a preorder date was announced the clock started ticking for both of us I cannot find anything I dont like with Samsung even my tablet while getting a little old is still as awesome as when I first got it I didnt want to give up my S5 but as soon as the girl handed me my new phone and told me that it would be finished loading all of my apps by the time I got home I was in loveand addicted to the fact that I can now transfer stuff from my thumb to my phone Love that little attachment And I love that your products are consistently at a high standard Ive come to require when it comes to my electronics Even though there are issues with the finger scanner compared to the Galaxy 5 it runs fast cool long lasting battery and charges very fast This is by far one of the greatest smartphones ive ever had It could use a ir blaster but other than that everything about it is just pure awesomeness I am very happy with my phone The battery life is very good and it feels good in my hand I cannot connect to my radio which is a must for me and ito very frustrating Also I cant figure out how to get my device to show up on find my phone I read a few places its not supported Why On a new phone Love everything about my Galaxy S7 Its perfect Love that it has the same stuff as my previous phone had and love the new features as well I think the charger where you just sit the phone on top of it is SO FREAKIN COOL The screen is so clear and sharp And my favorite is the camera I take so many pictures and the quality of the pictures on this phone are amazing My 4th galaxy and I love the new features Easy texting photos crystal clear screen outdoors My reception strength is not as good as my s4 Im not certain how I feel about this phone yet  Activating  it at Best Buy used up 82 of my data for the month so I wont be surfing the web on this phone until next month  So far however when Im connected to the charger at home I found that the phone is quick to respond to my touch and Im really happy with the 32GB storage capacity  Being able to purchase the phone at a substantial discount I have really good credit with Verizon didnt hurt either Great features on the applications to make each one to suit your needs Camera is excellent Voice calls are crystal clear But it will drop calls more than it should Although i do have data in places my iphone didnt Battery drains fast so have a charger on hand The screen in plenty big enough Over all I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to anyone Everything I hated about my S4 Mini I love about the S7 So happy I decided to stick with Samsung I love my new S7 Edge the color Is better than I expected and the sleek design is great I love having the ability to have my contacts and other things I use most on the edge of my screen for quick access I have had wonderful connection to WiFi and my phone has full bars in my house compared to other phones I have had which did not have much service at all

I also love the themes that I can chose from to make my phone my own there are lots of free ones and the ones that you have to pay for are not that costly I think it gives the phone character and can have the theme that fits my personality

I think the water resistant feature is great too I would never poor a bottle of liquid on it like the ad on tv shows the man doing but at least I know I do not have to worry

Thank you for creating such a great phone Absolutely love the new phone works great The features are good and the phone is fast but the quality of the speaker feedback is subpar This is a great phone Awsome screen great camera and its water resistant again I never would have upgraded if I knew I would have so many issues The best  is so inexpensive  accepts an SD Mirco Best designed phone ever Perfect size screen and the curved edges are superb Even though Im still a learner I am very impressed with the many creature comfort features this phone has  The improvements over the previous model are amazing  Try one for yourself I bought last week and havent had any problems This phone is smooth and fast The phone feels great in your hand and I LOVE the camera as always The speakers could be a little better but Im sure thats because the phone is waterproof and you have to lose a little in other places The phone really is one of the best and I couldnt be happier with it Wish it didnt come with so much bloatware though The features on this phone are awesome I will never go to any other company Samsung is awesome After so many years been on iPhone till the latest version of 6S I decided to try Samsung S7 Edge and went for it At first it was a struggle to move stuff from iPhone to Samsung tried doing manually moving apps contacts etc it was a nightmare Few days later I realized that its a snap thru Samsung SmartSwitch and completed my rest of the move in just few mins Display is awesome vibrant crisp and photos look great Add to it the camera and video mode give more options than regular cookie cutter iPhone features I felt like liberated from iOS rigid structure to open structure with lots of freedom and options to customize your Samsung Music thru Samsung Milk is phenomenol and I use the music stations all thru my free time Love the feature of SD card but make sure you get genuine Samsung Class 10 U3 SD card I wasted my money buying a cheap Micro SD card 64GB Class 10 but I missed out on U3 and the experience was horrible Cant take any video and writingreading from sd card was horrendous After I upgraded SD card to Samsung Pro card writeread speeds were super fast and recording highest quality video became so easy
S7 edge screen size I felt vey similar to my bulky iPhoneS6 but with a smaller form factor and its a huge advantage that S7 edge feels very comfortable and handy to carry S7 edge doesnt feel huge at all I had a Windows phone but switched because of lack of apps and new phones  The Galaxy 7 has been great  The transition has been relatively easy and the number of apps is great  The camera takes great pictures  I am still learning all the features but so far am very satisfied Its simple one of the best ones so far love that you can still charge it wireless and that it doesnt crash like my previous phones This phone has great features that I love This phone has a problem with getting service my 5 got service every where S7 has the best battery life and it has a lovely display I traded in a GLAXY Note 4 for this new phone The GN4 was to large to be comfortable and very seldom used the pen I have found the GE7 very comfortable when holding and also in my pocket The new edge screen is awesome Needs to be more customizable to my use Its a new feature so it will get better The software and faster processor make this phone very smooth and user friendly I would recommend the Galaxy Edge 7 to anyone who likes to have the newest teconology Seriously just get one I switched from iphone to Samsung for this phone and dont regret a second I upgraded my older S5 to the new S7 Edge because my old phone had terrible battery life and was super slow 

Received the S7 Edge and love it EXCELLENT battery life as long as you arent using apps all day long

Only wish that SOMEONE would make a glass screen protector for it not the cheap plastic ones as I have gone through 4 already in 3 months from them splitting 

I DO have to reset the phone about once a week because it tends to freeze up at times but that isnt a huge issue I made the change from an LG G2 to the S7 It was an easy transition The phone can probably do about 1000 things and I do about 10 things The camera is amazing Both front and rearfacing is clear Love my new 7 Couldnt be happier Loads of great features The S7 edge is the slickest and best operating phone ever built The processor handles all games and daily tasks flawlessly The curved edges and the edge feature make this the slickest and most elegant phone on the market The screen is si beautiful and presents pictures like no other phone The S7 edge also allows to to add extra storage which is awesome up to 200 gb S7 edge also has a massive battery giving extended battery life You cant go wrong with buying this phone over any other phone out there I have had the phone for less than two weeks and have some issues First I had problems with texting I spent several hours on the phone with Verizon Wireless being switched from representative to representative

I also had great difficulty enrolling on the web site Both issues are resolved but with great difficulty and frustration I must say that the representatives were courteous and easy to understand

I am also disappointed with the Fast Charging adapter It takes two to three hours to charge I was told by the store rep it would charge as fast as 25 minutes The Galaxy S7 is the best Android device on the market right now That may not sound like much given how often new devices come out but the S7 took what I loved about its predecessor and the qualities of the Note 5 and put them in place on the S7

I normally have a lovehate relationship with Samsungs interface but for the S7 it has really found the right balance and the hardware just never runs out of steam It handles everything I throw at it with ease 

If I had to choose two features that stand out the most it would be the beautiful display and the camera The display is just gorgeous  it is easy to just stare at the colors are so saturated and pretty The camera is better than just about anything else out there including many pointandshoot cameras  youd have to look at compact 43 systems of DSLRs to exceed the capabilities of the camera on the Galaxy S7  its that good

Im very pleased with the device and if youre on the fence just go for it You get everything any other device has plus a great design beautiful display and stellar camera I have not had a lot of time to go through the phone in detail but what I have seen I am really liking  I was most impressed with the improved transition from the S4 to the S7 and the transfer of data  Overall I am still convinced that Samsung and Android are a better choice for me than the alternatives  I love the customization features the look the feel and the ease of use while still having lots of options Bought it for my wife and she loves it Really dont have anything negative to say about this phone I have 200gb of extra storage and got a free VR headset which is way cool 
Besides minor surface scratches on the display Im totally satisfied with the Galaxy S7 Edge 

Ps I wish I still had an IR Blaster Im on my 3rd edge now cause the past two phones I hadthe screens on both of them cracked and they barely hit the floor falling from lap sitting down and the screens shatterd The S7 is amazing and has more than exceeded my expectations Very fast and responsive Only thing I dont like is that when you are on the home screen you cant scroll backwards and it is hard to find a phone case with a belt clip The best phone I ever have Fast the new features are amazing and the camera is something that I cannot describe It is wonderful Bought it 8 days ago  Still getting used to the minor differences from my old phone  Phone is really easy to use and navigate  Good battery life so far  Takes great photos as well Absolutely Love the phone This phone is so much better than my old smart phone I had an LG and was very hesitant on switching brands Im glad I did This Samsung 7 is awesome I didnt realize how many options and features it had The battery life lasts a lot longer and the accessibility of apps is much quicker I am going to get the VR soon I cant wait to see what that has to offer I like all of the features yet Im still learning about the phone I cant even name all the things Im having trouble with for this phone Sometimes it wont save my contacts it keeps freezing it turns the screen off at random times its slow I lost so many things that I could do with my iphone There are so many reasons why I am frustrated with this phone but I am NOT happy with it at all Its a cool phone and its pretty and takes good pictures etc however I am so frustrated with it I miss my iphone I could of had a much cheaper replacement through our insurance to the new iPhone but was told how great this phone it and it is awful I love my new Galaxy 7 It takes great pictures and has a lot of tools to help take the perfect photo even if you missed it You can set it up to capture extra when you take a photo and rewind to the shot you thought you missed Great battery life Water resistant Ive only had it a week There is more advertising than before more offers of how to spend more money And I cant figure out how to download pictures to my PC This phone is top in its field and with the addition of the SD card makes it even better 1010 no better phone on the market Im still getting use to this phone This is the first smart phone for me Trying to get use to the different apps I love that you are about to do several things at one time I am a huge Samsung fan I love the look and feel of this phone I thought I would miss not having a stylus like I had with my Note 4 but I dont at all Perfect blend of upgraded functionality performance camera and storage Awesome having the micro sd again  New features on closed screen nice and having less bloat wear is wonderful SHared on the ATT site Basically after having a Galaxy 3 and tiring of the slowness and heavy battery consumption as opposed to iPhone ended up reading reviews of the S7 edge bought it and am Super Happy with its performance Am very pleased with the service and ease of operation I  am extremely happy that I made this purchase It has exceeded my expectations This phone is amazing All the features I need and more This phone has everything Its extremely user friendly and allows for a lot of personalization The phone itself is lightening quick and has a battery that lasts I went from a note 4 to this small sleek and fast phone Its camera is the best ever Only thing is I cant figure how to do thing quick But I love the edge feature and how light it is I would have given it a better rating but I dont like that it has a smaller screen than my S5 I cant say that Ive found anything else about it that I dont like I have to get an xd card Overall same as S6 but I guess the inside is an upgrade Smooth transition from S4 to S7 A few things in different places but a good way to learn the new phone Have had my Galaxy S7 for about a month now and really enjoy it The features are great and easy to use I really like that Samsung went back to removable storage The only drawback is keeping a screen cover on Ive been through 3 already in the month Ive had it Other than that its a great phone This is the best phone Ive ever owned It is super fast and the design is amazing The functionality and design of the phone are both stylish and easy The screen is impressive in both clarity and size Easy to use fun and gives you ease of access The Samsung Galaxy s7 has some very noteworthy features and some issues too

First the positive
I love the camera takes superb pictures with lightning fast auto focus Get compliments on the pictures a lot Front camera is amazing too

The processor and ram are pretty good for the phoneI rarely have a loading issue Everything runs smooth unless I have a lot open

Another plus is the water resistance I have taken this phone into a pool in Hawaii taken it into my shower and more No issues other than the one Ill mention in cons 

Last positives are the home button and accessories The home button I love because they let you repurpose it into a camera or galaxy and it feels good and solid Unlike the S5 button The fingerprint scanner works better as well

The accessories are pretty great as well Only downside would be how frequently I have to rearrange the Samsung Gear VR still works great though The Samsung Gear VR is a very awesome accessories that is certainly worth getting 


CONS 
First would be the material I hate the slick feeling of the case I have almost dropped it because of it I currently do not use a protective case because I frequently use my Gear VR and didnt want to keep taking it in and out of the case 

Overall I would recommend this phone because it is just awesome  

Second would be the sensitive screen to water It claims the water wont touch the screen and change options but it does It will act like a finger on the screen and stop videos you cant take pictures by pressing the screen under water and in a shower water droplets will change the song on Pandora or the place on Netflix 

The gear VR seems to take a while to position correctly on the S7 and occasionally I have to reunlock the phone after I insert it unlocked So that can get a bit annoying but most of the time its flawless I just got my phone 2 days ago and it is so pretty and techy looking I am almost afraid to use it Anyways the only complain thus far is that it heats up when I use the video recorder I have done a few things to try to troubleshoot it 
We shall see in the next few days 
Also the battery is draining quick it is 5 pm and I am at 55 This never used to happen to my HTC Maybe because it is so thin the battery lasts less A great product even for the price Hand Style I like Love it The camera is fantastic I was an iPhone user for several years prior to this purchase I was intrigued by the features offered with the S7 Edge most importantly the water resistant feature and the battery charging and capacity as I am a manager in the restaurant industry and have desperate need of avoiding moisture damage aND long battery life

This phone has exceeded all of my expecitations aND I dare say I dont miss my iPhone even a little bit I could not be happier with the switch to the Samsung product Highly recommend to everyone I recently upgraded from an S5 The S7 seems to be a drastic upgraded Specs aside the picture quality is better Movies and games play much better compared to its predecessor I havent owned and S6 so i cant talk about the difference between those two I was actually interested in getting an edge Wife wanted the S7 Happy wife happy life lol My Galaxy Note 4 edge had a better camera in my opinion When zooming in on pictures with this one it is grainy and wasnt on my Note 4 edge Also video is pixelated in this phone where it was not in Note 4 edge Do like the fact that the phone is waterproof Also phone works fast I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to the S7  After having the phone for about two weeks I continue to be satisfied  I am very pleased with the quality of images captured using the devices camera and the ease of storing them on the SD card  I guess I must be a heavy user because I require a little charging boost during the day an overnight charge is not sufficient to last through the day  I often use my phone onehanded and the onehanded feature has proven to be very helpful  The option to launch the camera with a double tap on the home key is also great  It is these little conveniences that make me really like this phone Great phone Glad to have the SD card feature back Fast  easy to set up  use Got this phone recently I upgraded from the galaxy 5 Pretty much the same phone with some upgrades Taking off the IR for whatever reason was kind of dumb in my opinion Coming from an s6 I love having an SD card slot and the slightly larger battery is useful The screen looks a lot better than I thought it could but the brightness is odd Either its too dim and muted or its blinding I cant find that sweet spot like I easily could on the s6 Overall I like it but it couldve been better The phone overall has shown a lot of progress from my last phone I owned Galaxy s5 Improved battery and more Owned nothing but Samsungs for over 10 years and am satisfied yet again by the S7 Feels more durable then my S4 and tons of new features good battery life the best so far dose everything else it is supposed to do good 
has a good solid feel with otter box defender case wireless cradle works great a must have 
for any phone Im overwhelmed with how amazing the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge looks performs and integrates new features and enhancements I upgraded from my Samsung S5 I was running out of battery life and it would take a long time to boot up after turning it off

The S7 Edge boots up in less than half the time and I only ran low with my battery once The pull down is organized significantly better It starts apps faster and the camera has taken some of my best shots 

I have recommended this phone to others without any reservations

My only complaint is the price It is the same complaint with almost every other top phone Fast and smooth operation Best phone I have owned so far I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy s5 and I love the feel functionality and sleek design of this new phone The OS is streamlined and works great Lots of improvements since the previous models Fast processed love the design reliable Nice sound quality Great options lots of built in apps Fantastic phone 
I have some problem with a few pink lines on screen 
I called ATT and they said they would service it No problem 
Otherwise The best phone Features are great and this phone looks and feels better than any other phone I have ever owned Love the amount of memory expansion Can hold enough photos to be of great value Ive had this phone for about 2 months now and I honestly cant think of one bad thing to say Just got the gear s2 to go with it and its great There are way too many pros to talk about for this phone The TouchWiz interface returns and performs as good as expected I bought this a week ago after my Glorious Droid Turbos screen cracked  I must say its a great phone The battery is a bit smaller in capacity but I get similar usage time so that is a plus Fingerprint lock is simple and quick to set up its feauture rich overall Truly smart phone  The only thing im not too fond of is the camera hopefully it grows on me I came from a Motorola moto x The S7 surprisingly has a good battery life The simplicity of managing programs is also amazing It also charges pretty fast I have had so much fun figuring out what my device does and how it works its easy and reliable Easy to use and features are so much better I had lost my old Nexus 6 and need a new phone Messages on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and have not been disappointed I was also really impressed from cloud back on my new phone I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is currently looking to upgrade This device is really great  Ive had no problems whatsoever i started with the galaxy s4 then the s5 I skipped the s6 but I am glad I waited for the s7 everything I loved about my s5 has been improved on the s7 and the case is beautiful the best Samsung phone by far I have owned Samsungs Galaxy from the beginning I started with the first one then to GS3 then GS5 and now GS7 I absolutely love this phone and with each new one Samsung out does themselves every time Its easy to use and understand It has everything u need in the palm of your hand And if its not on the phone already theres an app for it First Samsung phone since the instinct because I wasnt a fan of touch wiz but when it came time for a new phone there was only 3 choices htc 10 note 5 or s7never an iPhone But I was still hesitant because I hadnt seen touch wiz in a while After seeing them in store it was a done deal Took home the S7 edge because I didnt want to go down in screen size its a beautiful phone to look at and touch wiz is much more refined Well done Samsung The transition from the S4 to the S7 was very easy  I like the product upgrades This is a really nice phone the sound is loud camera excellent and the screen is so very sharp The phone is lightning fast and sreen is amazing The phone works great but they have nothing to protect the curve screen and will be damaged very easily
Therefore I wouldnt buy a another one and Im struck with the cost for repairs I really love the phone and everything about it tbh it makes me super happy especially the camera I am quite pleased with this phone Larger display for me but still thin and light Fast intuitive and the card slot is a real plus Bright screen great colors The camera is the best yet that I have used But it would be nicer if the video setting specified which was best for MMS The ear buds that came with it are surprisingly good Very good battery life which concerned me because it cannot be changed only charged It handles my considerable WiFi time my app usage and the struggle to find a 4G signal in my office and business Wireless charging is great but the cover has to be removed or it takes MUCH longer as one would expect I will miss the infrared emitter But I doubt there is a better phone on the market now The music and picture quality is amazing Battery life is also much better I love the easy to use features The added applications like the stay fit app tracks your steps and has so many features to keep you on track to stay fit The screen sensitivity is not adjustable I purchased an Otter case which would not work with the phone You had to bang on the keys to get it to register Had an S4 that Otter case worked great on Had to take case back Got a case that has protector placed on screen directly Phone is better but keyboard is still not sensitive enough Tried using Swift Key app but the keyboard is worst and now using Samsung keyboard again THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED Screen keyboard sensitivity needs to be user adjustable Do not like the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone Bluetooth to a Cubix stereo speaker has static and will not work properly That is unacceptable S4 works properly with same speaker Can not understand how this phone went through any Samsung system test facility and passed I am still learning how to use it The S4 seemed to be easier to go from picture to Facebook but it has only been two weeks Love the new s7 edge Better than the s6 they keep out doing themselves and now the water resistance and sd card is back The new silver color is nice Only thing I would like to see is the cool electric blue color they offer overseas in the US market Have been and will always be a samsung customer for life Since I got this phone I can definitely tell the difference between it and the Note 3 that I own I do think the edge bit is still a little gimmicky but I can see the uses starting to develop and realize I will have to change as well as the phone I am extremely happy with my purchase of the s7 edge I have always been pleased with Samsung phones but Samsung hit it out of the park with this one Totally top of the line product They thought of everything Its amazingly fast and super easy to use So easy to use sleek and sexy Super sound  best pictures I ever seen This is the first time i use samsung poduct and I am speechless with the product that i boughtAwesome This is a real nice phone and is fast and easy to use Only bad thing about the phone is and I mean this DONT DROP THIS PHONE EVAN AT 1 FOOT it will Crack I have had my phone for 2 weeks My S4 was dying faster on me after 2 and a half years I wanted an upgrade and got the S7 I used the cloud to transfer information over from my old phone to my new one but the S7 does come with a device that makes it super easy to transfer information from one phone to another I would rate the S7 a five star however I dont seem to have a privacy folder anymore and there are some things I dont want others to see but me

Overall  its a great phone and I am enjoying it This phone is top of the line and is one of the best phones that I have ever owned The new features are truly amazing and all the cool new gadgets push it over the top I absolutely love this phone This phone has the Best pictures and sound that Ive ever had Another great phone from the Galaxy series  Fast and lots great apps and useful tools Great size and weight Other phones I was looking at were too big to fit in my pocket The S7 is the perfect for me Love my new phone It does so many new things Still learning all the new features Coming up from an S5 I anticipated the S7 to be a smart upgrade I was not dissapointed The curved edge is new for me and is something to be careful of The camera was the main reason I upgraded and its image quality and features are excellant Fast start up and great images Battery life is good Finger print sensor is fussy but that could just be because of my fat fingers So I quit using it Heart rate monitor AND a pulseox meter UI is easy and quick Overall a fantastic phone I have owned several Samsung smart phones over the past 5 years from the Note Series to the S Series and each had their own qualities but the S7 pretty much has everything packed into one phone I dont doubt Samsung will exceed the greatness theyve achieved already but for the moment things are as good as it gets Lovely product Found it reasonably smooth transition from older model s3 Got accustomed to calendaring on s3 and would have preferred retaining similar functions but am gradually getting used to new methods accessing tasks memo etc Enjoying its use I was uncertain about upgrading to the S7 because I wasnt having any problems to speak of with my S4 but now Im happy that I did I have double the storage and a number of the apps that were giving me trouble on the S4 are running perfectly on the S7 Really love this phone Love the design and the features Charges really fast It was easy to set it up This is perfect phone to me
I love this galaxy 7 Im not very good at using smart phones The Samsung Galaxy 7 is easy to use and will guide you through any steps you might need to take to set up an app Im very satisfied Also the phone is lightweight and extremely durable Ive dropped it a couple of times on pavement by accident dont try it The phone has an excellent and easy to use camera I wished Id have kept my S5 I have had my s7 for about 3 weeks now it is hands down the best phone I have ever had the camera takes fantastic pictures Very fast phone also watch youtube all the time will be recommending it to everyone I know I love Samsungs this is by far the best one yet only downfall is that you cannot get to the battery if you need a new one The Samsung s7 edge has continued Samsungs amazing Galaxy line being the best thing to hit the market This phone is amazing and very user friendly My pictures are great and the wireless charging is a very nice feature If I had any complaints it would be that the speaker is not the greatest and Im not crazy about the placement either I like the camera because its very clear and lots of features in it Even my wife she have the iPhone 6s but she said that the camera on this is better The battery life is pretty awesome and so is the overall functionality of the phone I love my s7 edge side buttons are little touchy but excellent phone Really like the phone and all of its features Only downfall is that the battery loses power rather rapidly Best one yet Upgraded from my s5 Love the design and features First of all selfies is whats in and I the the face front camera I call it the selfie camera lol Front and back camera is clear as ever The battery life is really long lasting and trust me I am ALWAYS on my phone I upgraded from my S5 because the the S7 has a better camera and because the S7 is water resistant like the S5 I did not upgrade to the S6 because it was not water resistant  yes that matters Im enjoying every bit of this phone and its in my favorite color GOLD I bought this as an upgrade from the S4  The sound quality is magnificent compared to my old phone  My wife LOVES the video chat feature that comes standard  It reacts quickly doesnt feel like a small tablet only a hair larger than the S4 and is water resistant havent tested that yet but my phones have a tendency to go swimming so that was a plus out of the gate Good Battery Life last the whole day with out charging
Wireless Charging makes it easy to charge
Best Display crisp image vibrant colors
Expandable memory is a must
Best Camera near instant focus makes taking the perfect picture easy I like this phone specially camera is take nice and clear picture I recently upgraded from a S5 to the 
S7 edge I am extremely impressed with the graphics and camera in this phone not to mention the plate charger I bought for the S5 works with the S7 I have only had my phones and iPad for a week  and I love the s7 Havent had any problems I have been using Samsung from last 8 years I used Note 1 Note 3 and Note 4 This is the first time I preferred any model over Note series
I believe there is a strong reason for that This phone is not comparable to any other phone samsung has launched till date The design is very smooth and the most important reason for me to buy any phone is its performance and the ruggedness while using multiple applications Its been a week and this phone still amazes me
When ever I use it I see a different level of comfort which any other phone cannot provide I tried Iphone HTC and LG None could give the comfort and confidence on the performance Great product works great Its easy and fun to use A very capable device with some very nice features I have loved every Samsung product I have ever purchased This is by far the best phone out there right now My wife and I both love it The interface is great the features are awesome and the pictures are amazing Im glad I waited since my Note 3 to get this Worth the wait the phone has everything i need reliable and good battery life This product has amazing graphics its features are amazing it runs smoothly and on top of thathe the look of the phone is just magnificent When I first got this phone the volume button was extremely sensitive but it stopped soon after 
Im pretty sure this phone has a virtual reality feature but I dont know how to find it Brand new phone I find having to charge at least once a day 

Other than that I really like the phone I love this phone the only thing i could recommend is make the phone more heavy duty all the features I need A great mobile device The best camera Nothing more to say My S7 Edge is full of rich features killer camera great speed This phone is hands down the best that has ever come out Great accessibility great expansion GLAD THEY BROUGHT THAT BACK fantastic water resistance

Only negative is the edge does allow for accidental screen actions from side touches that were unintentional from just holding it not something that can be corrected probably but an annoyance at best Ive had the Galaxy S7 for about two weeks now I wish Verizon would have offered it in 64gb but I guess that doesnt really have anything to do with Samsung 

Even though it is a 32gb phone 14 gb are used just for the operating system  I ran out of room on my old 16gb phone because apps keep getting bigger and you cant move an entire app to the SD card Also the OS takes more room each time it updates I suspect that the remaining 18gb available on the S7 will be used up before long as apps keep growing in size So storagewise I dont feel the phone has a long enough lifespan I wish it didnt come with so many preinstalled apps that I dont use but can only turn off not uninstall

I upgraded from the S5 and I can really tell that it runs more quickly and smoothly even after I did a factory reset of my S5 I like the themes I like the camera Im still not sure I like having the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone by the charger port

I do miss the old keyboard on my S5 It had Swype and I could have access to both my English and Spanish spellcheck at the same time The builtin keyboard options for the S7 dont have Swype or the duallanguage keyboard I realize I could get an app for this at some point but I was disappointed that Samsung ditched a good thing They have continuous entry but its not the same as Swype I can no longer get a capital i by swyping from the i to the shift key I never realized how often I did it until I switched to this phone

Samsung took away the music app  now you use the preinstalled Google Music to store your audio and create playlists Im still getting used to that

Other than that Im really happy with my new phone  I trust the Samsung brand to work well and it is doing just that The phone is ok It is not user friendly First off im a samsung fan wit phones This is a cool phone but some things could be better They changed a few things like my music player it group everything together Switched to the share plan and used my upgrade from the s4 to the s7 Hands down the best decision Ive made Id had my sights set on it since it came out and after looking at the specs in the store I knew I needed to have it Im replacing a S5 and it performs much better Less lost calls and people can hear me better The case is slippery to hold and can easily drop I always prefer samsung phones over any other brand and this one got everything is fast reliable and with all the gadgets gear s2 and vr is the best combination in the market I love my phone so far so good I love my new Samsung S7 It has a big enough display to be easy to use yet small enough to be practical And the features are too numerous to elaborate upon here Its plenty fast and once I learned the Power Save mode the battery life is outstanding The keyboard is larger than most and I like the ease of use by having the entire alphabet and number set on the same page without having to shift back and forth Its the simple pleasures in life that make this phone a joy to use Lets just say that compared to other phones Ive used the S7 blows them all away Great job Samsung Not only is this an amazing phone with great systems but it is also water proof I have a simple bumper case on my phone and we were at the lake 10 days after I got my phone I accidentally dropped my phone into 13ft water It was submerged almost 2 hours by the time my husband got his scuba gear and was able to find it It was still working when he pulled it out and I have not had any issues with it I LOVE this phone and recommend it to everyone The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best smartphone I have ever used It has so many useful features Great size and a beautiful design Innovative technology and the fastest processor to date The GS7 really earns its name as the flagship phone along with its edge counterpart and the Note 5 Through my personal use with the GS7 I love it Its got all the tools I need right in the palm of my hand and doesnt disappoint with crystal clear images and the camera is to die for Plenty of features to save battery and lots of space and room for more My favorite thing is that Samsung brought back the expandable memory slot which I hope Samsung Galaxy continues to keep on the next generations Great product for a decent price in the end Samsung does it again they topped their S6 and then some This phone has great design and the software is extremely smooth Beautiful phone Easy to grip and very stylish Love the true color black I love my galaxy s7 I have been a galaxy fan ever since and a Samsung product owner for other devices Their capability to be able to talk to other Samsung devices with ease makes it a perfect device I love the fact that I can add more memory to it if I need it and I have my online storage as well The Samsungs galaxy s7s camera is awesome with the lowlights capability and fast focus makes taking pictures of my kids a snap Overall a really good phone Camera is really good Screen is very good Size is ok for one handed use Would not want it any taller Battery life is good enough to get through most days without charging But miss the removable battery on my S4 
The slightly curved edges make it hard for a screen protector to fit correctly Glass covered back seems dumb No temperature sensor or IR blaster like my S4 which are missed on occasion Finger print scanner is good but could be better at detection I am so happy i was able to get this phone its light weight and very affordable Samsung doesnt disappoint This phone is lightning fast the camera is unbelievable and it is easy to navigate I love my new galaxy s7 edge paired with my Samsung gear s2 watch Only thing I am disappointed with is that they did away with the IR remote ability The Galaxy 7 is easiest model to use Samsung has ever offered  I have had many Samsung phones and this blows them all away It is loaded with great features apps and options You cant go wrong The 12 megapixel camera is spectacular  the photos are so vibrant it is like i am right there The screen resolution is phenomenal My last cell was an Iphone and this Samsung is night and day better  If you want to upgrade this is your phone I get a new phone about every 9 months This is the first phone Ive been able to use for just about everything I do Especially loving the Samsung Pay The edge features are nice as well once you get them customized Last time I had a phone was the Samsung Galaxy s4 so to upgrade to the s7 has been amazing The quick response it has and Internet speed is great Love that I can get it wet as well Ive been using it for about 2 months now I have found that the battery life is great With a full charge in the morning I could get a full day of fair usage I do not use the always on display to not waste any battery I have found that the wifi is very unstable I have noticed this problem in previous models as well It is only with samsung devices All other devices I have used dont have this issues so I know it is not my network It also has issues on any other wifi I connect to Definitely a change from my Windows phone but now I get to use all the apps I want to Finally sprang for a new phone  Got rid of my Razr and got an S7  I love it  Battery life is incredible No long wait for bootup Good phone Good speed Solid phone No complaints Average run time for being on the phone constantly Charges without a problem  and is user friendly I love this phone My HTC one was dying a horrible slow deathonce my free upgrade  was available I ran to best buy to get a new phoneit was between this and a IPhoneIve always been partial to android even though their latest update screwed my phoneI didnt need the edge just more glass to break and the has all the same featuresits very user friendly and I couldnt be happier Happy with the phone so far Saw on commercial and needed a new phone this phone is what I want I upgraded from Galaxy S5 to S7  It was easy to switch the information from my old phone to the new one  No problems at all very smooth  I was glad I could do the transfer myself This phone is top notch Its so fast its sleek the camera is top notch from all the phones and overall its water resistant I even tested it out It also has removable storage and its just the best It saves your online info if you choose to so you dont have to type it in again I love this phone a lot I only wish privacy screens were available for this model WOW it is everything and more it is advertised to be Great features and very fast and intuitive The S7 is the perfect evolution from the S5 completely skipping over all the mistakes from the S6 and keeping all the advances Great phone with a great network My past 2 phones have been Samsung Galaxy started with the S5 now the S7 The changes they have made have been great on the phone and the android system gets better and better I love this phone and still learning new features but cant wait to see what the future holds for Samsung I bought it a week ago and I do like it very much Allow it is not as wide as my last phone Galaxy 3 I am getting used to it This phone has all of the functions and features I expected from a Samsung product I have had no issues with it an am completely satisfied This phone is not waterproof like they announced it to be the warranty doesnt cover water damage because its not waterproof 

My speaker started to make static noise and it took them 2 days to figure it out and the speaker is not in a good location at all I am liking the upgrades on this model compared to my S5 I wish they would have stayed with a replaceable battery but this one seems to get me thru the day All in all enjoying my new phone I am samsung for life and this phone reinforces that as long as samsung continues to make phones this gorgeous it will make it a no Brainer when it comes to up grading Of course the operating system is flawless always has been and has only gotten better I own multiple samsung products tv laptop and both me and my wife have samsung phones I love samsung and will continue to be a loyal costumer because of there reliable products and beautiful look Its a great phone just wished it had more memory like 128 gigs I never thought I would want anything other than an IPhone and I love my Samsung 7 edge I had an IPhone for 6 years and didnt know how it would be to have anything else Very Happy Customer Glad I upgraded to the S7 I love this phone really Brilliant camera great performance and the ability to strip it to mostly be vanilla Android Marshmallow That being said there are two issues one minor and one unfortunately major

1 Industrial design Some el cheapo in the hierarchy at Samsung obviously decided that having a unimolded band around the sides was too expensive and made it four pieces attached by a rubber grommet Unfortunately this weakened the corners so that when the inevitable fall happens if it strikes that corner a hairline crack will appear on the screen radiating from one of those cornerslike on mine 

2 Why you cant use unified storage is beyond me Yes I understand an SD card could potentially be much slower but why include the slot but not allow for its integration with the OS feature Love my new phone Samsung destroys IPhone The features and ability to make my phone to fit my needs is awesome My son has an IPhone and we always have phone wars I always win I say can your phone do this he is totally silent as I respond with mine can He has now decided to get a Samsung 7 edge  2 weeks and really happy Old phone couldnt keep upwithdemands of a mobile job The Google play and the quick changing and long battery life is some of the great features it has and plus it water resistant This is one of the best phone made so far I love the phone The camera is pretty good just expected better quality when zooming in Also the battery does not last long when I only use the camera and everything else is turned off Seriously the best performing phone ever Camera is awesome There will always be some who will find faults with the finest of products I read the reviews from tech magazines of many phones before my purchase There was little doubt that I would be happy  with the S7 but I guess Id have to say that I am now impressed If I had any doubts about anything it would have been the non removable battery After seeing how long the battery lasts through the day and how fast it recharges the removable battery is a non issue If anything could be improved it would be the predictive text a feature I rely on but thats not a deal breaker for me as it still is pretty good  The great keyboard makes up for a lot The screen is clear camera precise call quality like a fine audio system There is just too much to like about this phone I recently upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 to the Galaxy S7 and have to say that I am very pleased with the upgrade The S7 has been the easiest upgrade process that I have gone through so far And minus access to the battery the S7 has everything that I was looking for in a new phone The front and back cameras are both very good quality This is my favorite Galaxy yet I have owned every iteration from the Samsung Galaxy S captivate forward each have been more featurefilled than the last although the lack of external storage on the S6 was a turnoff The S7 is very fast the TouchWiz interface is much improved over previous versions and I have yet to notice any slowdowns 

The camera along with its OIS optical image stabilization is hands down the best camera Ive seen in a phone I was really happy with the quality of prints from my S5 but the clarity of the new sensor in the S7 almost puts it on part with my DSLR Nikon 

Im a heavy user and the life of the 3000 mAh battery does not disappoint All day long all day strong 

The Gorilla Glass 4 that is used seems quite durable this is the first phone that I have not put a screen protector on I carry my keys and lose change on the opposite pocket just in case 

All in all the performance of this phone has won my heart I bet it will win yours too This phone is a great phone My favorite thing about it is the camera and the customizing android allows you to do I upgraded from an iphone 5s and iphone doesnt allow you to customize at all 
The camera takes great pictures in light or dim lighting I would definitely recommend this phone to a friend In fact i did After i got mine my husband also ended up getting one and he loves his too I got this phone to replace my Galaxy Note 2 which was way overdue for an upgrade  The Galaxy 7 is a great size and has some cool features  I do miss having the stylus and have not found the battery life to be as spectacular as I was led to believe it would be  I do like the camera and the clarity of the screen  The only issue I have noticed is that I have to restart the phone fairly frequently to keep the Facebook app working correctly Great phone  Easy to use  I am not well versed in technology yet I can use the phone with no problems Good phone in general
Likes
 screen is very good 
 always on clock is neat
Not so great
 edge hit by palm and selects checkbooks such as the group conversation in sms
 edge shows info I am not sure how to configure The combo deal was great but the phone itself is difficult to use  Wish I could get back to my Note series  Think I need to go to the classes to get more out of the phone The features on this phone are great and the camera is outstanding I couldnt have chosen a better phone very good phone fast and reliable waterproof and SD card put it over the top the only thing id want different is bigger screen size  Nice fresh features in the edge display reminiscent of the note 4 edge display a plus The water proof idea is good but I despise the NON removable battery Storage is a nice feature after we the customers asked why remove it Great device but I like the note series for work I totally recommend everyone to buy the S7 It will be the best phone you ever had I bought this a week ago and am thinking of returning it Sleek fast and energy effiecientworks well and integrates the particles of my life It is very adaptable and the battery design and heat pipe keep pace with my life and just keeps working The battery is all day strong  Unlike master card I wont leave home without itwith Samsung pay who needs a card anyway After having a bartender spill a whole glass of ice water on my phone I picked it up wiped it off and no issues what so ever That alone makes this phone worth having This phone is packed with awesomeness Very impressed with how fast it charges  all the different features this phone has I could spend hours just messing around with what was programmed into the phone at 1st use Love the gold color too  water resistant For up to 30 minutes Awesome Much better battery life I can really see how much better the lcd display has become since my last phone was an S4 the phone is running much smoother than my S4 and the fact that I could use my phone with gear vr is a huge plus Not to mention the battery life is amazing I use the phone all day on one charge but I will still have enough to last me until the next Spectacular phone The edge display is beautiful and doesnt take much getting used to The performance is great and the return of the microSD card slot is a huge win The fingerprint scanner works very well but would be even better if it was on the back Great new features Edge is awesome a new taller edge screen is brilliant Longer battery life concert hall sound are big bonuses Move over iPhone This is absolutely the most amazing phone Ive ever owned  great features The edge screen makes the phone not look like a phablet but still has the big screen area also helps with reaching everywhere on the screen Love the screen quality picture great Fingerprint unlocking works well and makes the accessibility easier Even though it does not have a stereo speaker speaker quality good and loud Best feature sd card reader and waterproof I absolutely love this phone I had been an iPhone user before but was getting tired of their constant updates and lack of memory expansion Ive had a galaxy tablet for a long time and loved it so thought Id give the galaxy phone a try Im so happy I di  No disappointment here Everything youd expect and more the protective clear cover over the display makes it hard to press on side keyeshave to press very firm 
the phone serves its purpose I love the Galaxy S7 My only issue with it at all isnt even an issue with the phone itself but android text features vs iPhone Group texts convert to multiple media messages and use data Not cool from a mom with very active kids and group texts messages are constantly coming and going I wish that group messages would be sent as justhe regular text messages using no data I realize that I can check the box for the group option to be turned off but then I get 20 individual messages saying please reply to the group and not just me individually so that everyone sees your response Frustrating But I do love the phone Everything else is so much better than an iPhone Great overall phone Ive been an android user since the Droid 2 days and I have to say Samsung finally knocked one out of the park I have no performance issues at all with this device and updates are rolled out much quicker than any other Verizon Android device Ive used in the past First of all I had the first galaxy edge and loved it I recently upgraded to the 7 edge This phone has been nothing but headaches While I am viewing am article online or Facebook it always takes me somewhere else as Im reading I have done numerous factory data resets with no luck I contacted Samsung and followed there instructions again no luck So frustrating I just finished my first week with Verizon and this phone  I loaded all my music on a 64 SD card and the music app couldnt find the files  Numerous music player apps were downloaded none of them could discover the MP3 files until I had tech support rescue the phone by transferring the files back and forth and then they were finally discoverable

The voicemail doesnt always work  I have been getting the notification telling me this even though its been set up and have received some messages

I set the clock alarm 5 times for wakeup alerts  Its worked only twice 

The phone ran hot for the first 2 days even without the protective case  The battery drained at an excessive rate forcing me to use power saving settings which limit my functionality of the phone  

I received an alert informing me on the eve of the 2nd day that I had burned through the entire months supply of shared data6GB in one day  While it is roundly suspected that resulted from the hour long tech session I am now constantly trying to find a Wifi signal something that I never did before  I used to use my previous phone a Samsung Galaxy S4 liberally with a different provider  I never went over 2 GB per month  YouTube Facebook Wikipedia and random internet searches were all part of my daily usage  This bizarre 6GB data burn and accelerated battery depletion has led me to avoid using my phone  I get the feeling that there are apps or phone functions burning data and power without my knowledge

To put my mind at ease Ive set up mobile data alerts that apparently keep my daily usage to a maximum so that I wont head towards a monthly overage  This results in a late afternoon shutoff of my data which I have to override to access the internet  And Im hardly using the phone

I have scheduled a workshop with Verizon next week to address my concerns and questions  Until then I am not able to develop that love relationship one normally gets with their new phone especially a technological wonder like a Samsung S7  Right now it feels like a beast I need to tame Great features High resolution Fun to use
Once you own a Samsung you will me look back i bought this phone 2 weeks ago and its been great Feels good in the hand awesome screen great camera no probs with wifi or tethering  But talking to someone on speakerphone is horrid  The speaker distorts and sounds harsh and shrill even at only 30 volume  My 4 year old Nokia 920 sounds a lot better Good so far That sums up my experience up to now I had the s5 when i got an email offering a free gear s2 with the preorder of the s7 edge that seemed like a good value I am happy enough with the s7 edge the screen just isnt as big as i was expecting The dual curved edge seems to eat up a lot of surface area and not really do much I absolutely love this phone The camera and picture quality is amazing The battery life is pretty good I only have to charge it every 2 to 3 days I do wish it had a removable battery that was the only negative thing about the phone The screen is vivid and crisp Im so glad I upgraded to the S7 from the S4 There are so many things I like  It charges fast  photos are awesome  perfect sizeIm extremely happy The 7 edge is the best phone I have owned thus farI had the previous Samsung Note line before trying the Samsung 6 edge plus and now my edge 7The phone performance is outstanding and love the cameraI take alot of pictures of my grandchildren and the quality is oustandingI recommend everyone to try the edge plus and if you have another android phone or Iphone I guarantee you will never turn back once you own and use a edge7 The phone is gorgeous Perfectly crafted Cristal clear image and definition The camera is freacking fast and it really does performe great with low light It takes the best pictures I have seen and the people arround would want you to take their pictures The phone feels solid and resistant Smoth to the touch of the hands Is simply and definitely the phone to have the best one created so far Im a total fan I cant think of anything to change on this phone the size is perfectthe screen size great I am 67 and not much of a technical geek but I love my S7 Upgraded from in Iphone6 I made a great choice I upgraded my phone from the galaxy 5 to the 7 edge and I am 100 in love with it I love the curved design the camera quality the vivid colors Everything about this phone is perfect I actually feel smartMakes everyday life simple  The edged screen is a nice addition to the phone and would definitely recommend it to a friend This phone is great and the picture quality is the best Ive ever seen I love the phone but I am really frustrated  with verizon Couldnt be happier with the phone I really like the Galaxy S7 Edge overall but it had a few problems The first one had trouble cutting out and dropping calls I took it back and got a replacement This was much better I am still having trouble with the micro sd card I put in a 64 gig card which didnt work right and was told by the store that 64 gig cards werent supported yet I got a 32 gig card which worked fine I think it is very poor to advertise a phone taking up to 200 gig cards when they arent supported yet Otherwise for the most part the phone is great Samsung has done it again with the one hand touch ability Everything you wont without the ton of apps you dont Its a great phone Love the S7 The only reason it didnt get 5 stars is because it doesnt have the edit features on the camera that my S5 had Maybe when it updates It does everything faster and better than the 5 The camera is a lot better just cant frame or add stickers to your pictures I had been looking at this phone online for several months before I got it It really was the only phone I considered It did not disappoint me Im happy and look forward to using it for a long time Im totally an Android person Droppeditfrom 15 feet and shattered the screen but still love your product Phone does not work well while it is wet The sound etc 
The speaker could definitely be louder
Some gaming apps still need to be fixed
Screen isnt scratchproof Simply drying my phone with a body towel after it got wet put swirl marks on the screen
Battery life isnt as good as I expected
The calls through WiFi feature is finally here and its great
The edge design features I do not use
Contacts do not link with Facebook I miss having Peoples fb info linked such as pictures Absolutely the best device there is Phone is super fast and barely lagslove using it and much better then any phone Ive ever used Overall this has been a good upgrade My biggest grip with the S5 was that I ran out of the 16gb fast The S7 has 32gb which despite the expandable memory option should had been offered with either 64gb or 128gb in the USA I skipped the S6 because it did not have expandable memory but the one gripe I have about the S7 is HOW they made the slot for that memory There is NO WAY TO REMOVE THE BATTERY that I liked with the S5 I carried an extra battery with my S5 but can not do that with my S7 As for battery the S7 is much better at handling the power requirements than previous generations As for performance you have to turn off the battery saver to get everything out of the phone but that is to be expected But I bet most people do not do that  poor battery life
 nice design
 edge stuff who cares
 multitasking slows it down 
 too light almost Delicate feeing
 touch wiz not bad but why need it at this point
 meh The only issue that I have is that the phone hearts up really bad during any video chatting I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge 32gb phone I had the S4 and liked it too but the S7 has longer battery life and is faster with a larger display The only option I am missing is the IR feature that the S4 had for remote control of my tv and amplifier The camera is fantastic and takes quality pictures very fast I would highly recommend this phone to everyone I really like my new galaxy s7 edge I love the way it looks and the battery life The camera takes excellent pictures I would recommend this phone to everyone Switched over from an iphone and i had some doubts and the beginning but the process of switching was really easy samsung definitely did a great job designing this phone Absolutely love it My Samsung Galaxy 7 is a wonderful phone Really love the improvements done since the galaxy 5 Would recommend to all of my friends and coworkers I bought this because I had replaced my S5 multiple times dUeda to OS problems This phone looks and functuous just like the S5 which I love because I already know how it works  The camera is much better but other than that all the bells and whistles are identical The features that I like are the wireless charging capability the battery life and the quality of the photos produced by the camera in low light situations The phone is fast and connects well with other Bluetooth products like my TV and my Gear S2 smartwatch I also like the Samsung utility software that can detect and correct any issues that might occur It reminds me to restart my phone when I havent done so in a while In mining mud and water from drills Phone performing well in damp environment Great video and pictures Fast slick amazing performance and great camera I feel like its already made all my choices for me More developer options please I want to feel like I made my device what it is Like a private assistant For the most part this phone is almost identical to the S5 that I had prior However this phone keeps freezing on me  everytime I try to open my gallery an error message pops up saying that the gallery has stopped I like the new Samsung Galaxy s7 edge I enjoyed the new feature like the water proof The Galaxy S7 edge feature big screens in incredibly slim designs that fit comfortably in the palm of my hand They perfected the S7 edges curved screen so all you need to do is swipe for instant updates I enjoyed that I will suggest this phone to my family and friends It does not work well I have nothing but issues with it Speech functions do notwork I am into support a lot I wish I had not gotten the 7 I tell everyone why to not get it This phone is the bomb Smart phone more like genius phone Camera is awesome very quality feel Phone reception is great as well as call quality Screen color amazing Sum up to one word fantastic very happy with my purchase a good phone I really enjoy this phone so much its the perfect size and has great new features as well I totally recommend this phone to others who love Samsung as much as I do Thank you Had it 2 weeks havent had no problems out of it Easy transferring stuff from old phone with USB deal that come with new phone This phone by far has had the most features accessibility battery life than any other phone on the market The phone is easy to use and extremely durable Device compatibility is great I bought my phone about a week ago and this is the second phone I got but it gets hot to often I dont like that I turned the first one in because it got hot and now this one does too We wanted something different in a phone that had more durability as we are very involved in water sports and lost 4 iPhones in last 2 years to water 2 and damage

THis phone was great with more GB 32 and easy reload of our apps  We were pleasantly surprised to have our contacts port over as well  

Love this phone I have been camping out for the iPhone for the last 4 models but NEVER again I am a Samsung user now and I love my S7 Edge its amazing how much of a difference it is between the two platforms I have made a complete switch to Samsung and I am glad I did I was tired of the control system anyway I am pretty happy with my new smart phone and love Samsungs regular improvements  Because the S7 is new I have had some problems finding the right case protective light weight and screen protective The battery is holding its charge well and better than my S5 I have adapted to the small drawer that holds the MICROSD CARD and my 128gig card shouldnt fill up too easily I love my new galaxy s7 Works really quickly and is very user friendly I got my Galaxy S7 as soon as it came out And now Im on my second one about to get a third The reception is terrible I cant be on the phone and on line at the same time because I get an error message that says the apps cant be used while on the phone The galaxy s5 was a way better phone With way better reception Im going to give them one more chance to fix the issues If there cant fix it I might see if the have a s5 in Stock This phone is just perfect The apps the expandable memory and the battery life on the phone is incredible I use the phone all the time to watch netflix and videos and it literally lasts me all day Came from the Galaxy 5S
Thanks photos taken with this phone are so crisp and clear The extra memory is also great as I was running game out of memory on my S5 Still discovering all the different features However I wish they would have kept the company tate functionality within the phone button Now if I want to look up a contact in a group I must use the contact button The phone button will no longer allow access to the company tact group I love Everything about this phone Awesome phoneso fare love it Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 mini to the S7 and have not looked back Very easy to set up and use excellent picture quality and lots of cool features Great to have the date and time always on on the lock screen I came in to buy a set of earbuds and was informed I could upgrade I decided to see what my options were The Galaxy S7 is a great phone and I am so glad I chose it The S7 has tons of features It is a lot to learn but it is fun Way faster than my galaxy 4 Like the feature that it can stay unlocked while at the address you or the GPS enters Like the clock that shows on the locked screen Battery life seems great so far Really like the little plug that allows copying from the previous phone Like the close all button moved off the manual main button to save it from getting worn out I am happy with this phone I love my new S7 with all the new features like better camera always on clock slim look etc though I wish there were a few more ringtones and longer lasting battery I got this phone a few days ago First thing I noticed was the battery life surpassed my S5 I love the fast charging feature When I was configuring my phone I had a ton of issues maintaining a wifi connection I had to force an update to fix the problem and it was a huge pain Since the update it has been all good The screen is very clear and the phone is thinner Overall not much improvement from the previous Galaxy phones but it is a good phone I upgraded from the S5 I like that the phone is water and dust resistant I love the fact it has the wireless charging Most of the features are very similar than the S5 but improved The phone works great and does everything I want it to I got this phone because of reviews and my son has one
Glad I did phone does exactly what I want The Samsung S7 is by far the best most advanced phone if you want to call it that I have ever seen But its not a phone really Its a pocket computer TV media center cameracamcorder all in one Its display is awesome I havent even come close to learning all its functions but Im having fun trying I am so happy that I bought this phone fast and easy its a very nice phone for me and my needs I enjoy the water resistant features of the new Galaxy S7 The biggest plus to this phone is the battery life well the picture quality is great too Very easy to use I have recommended this phone many times already I was in doubt when I transferred over from Note 4 because I loved my battery independence I knew I had to deal with reality soon I took the leap of going to the S7 and I love having my size back from the S4  sorry Note family I love the size the camera and additional features like the double tap to the camera app I got over the battery issue because I can wireless charge my phone yayyy I guess I adapted to change well Keep up going back to basics Samsung very proud I absolutely love the Galaxy S7 The battery lasts so long its amazing after having a phone that died by 3pm This one will last 3648 hours on 1 charge The camera takes fabulous pictures too Would definitely recommend this phone to everybody I would not change a thing Maybe a bigger screen Glad you brought back the spot for sd cards This phone was easy to set up and easy to use I use voice typing a lot and my old phone had a hard time keeping up This phone works perfect As a food and travel blogger I need a great camera to capture blogworthy photos on the flyand this camera is exactly what the doctor ordered In fact the camera is the main reason I selected this phone It takes great photos even in dimly lit restaurants
Im pleased with the overall performance of the phone but some of the original factory settings required extra time to reset for optimum results I also wish I could rename OK Google with an original name so my phone would respond only to meand not to everyone else with an OK Google phone prompt
I have small hands and the slim design of the phone is perfect for me
Thanks It was time to upgrade my phone so I evaluated several different manufactures and models My conclusion was the the Galaxy Edge 7 was my best choice I enjoy the performance and speed I enjoy the always on display and overall performance I especially appreciate the SD drive letting me control the amount of storage available Even the earphones beat the competition Like my s5 better screen doesnt work with gloves on or cant change sensitivity of it Love my phone The product is very easy to use and very stylish Only thing I dont like is its a little small for my preference otherwise great phone A light phone with a large screen and fantastic quality of display Great quality of reception from WiFi to Cell and not a dropped call yet Camera is fantastic with great quality and dual camera makes life easier when needed this phone is amazing in every aspect I love the design the performance and I love the finger print scanner Absolute amazing phone hands down I recently upgraded from the Galaxy S3 to this and I love it The camera is awesome and I especially love that I can take a great picture in dim lighting I am very happy with my purchase The ONLY thing I would change is allowing the groups to have their own texts tonesinstead of haVing individually assign them I have never owned a Samsung phone I upgraded from a Droid Turbo that was frustrating me with its terrible photo quality So far everything with this phone just simply works without hassle

I chose it because I could actually hold it in my hand unlike other devices that just keep getting bigger so I am unable to navigate with one hand

It has a very high quality feel to it and I love the look and design

I was worried about battery life but quick the charging battery is really fast with the included charger

I also love that it has expandable memory

One reason why I never switched to Samsung in the past is that they had different chargers than the USB charger that every other device seems to be using I love that this is compatible with all of the other chargers that I have laying around so I can have a charger in every place I may need one

So far so good I bought this a few weeks ago  it never leaves my presence I love everything about it Had this for a few weeks and I love it  I wouldnt go back to anything besides android and Samsung Less than 14 days ago  Works great so far Ive had this phone for 2 weeks and i love it Easy to use and fast processor After having the previous phone for 5 years or so getting a new Samsung model made the transition a breeze Some things work differently and Ill have to adjust slightly but overall am very pleased it does everything  I love it  Love the new features and easy to use swipe Absolutely love them 2 in all respects but one  These do everything that our old Droid 4s failed to do Internet is rock solid and fast excellent camera beautiful screen great sound voice quality is the best ever  Love it  But the original purpose for buying a cell phone is to get the PHONE  Fail here  Cannot reliably connect phone calls either inbound or outbound  Mostly when one end of the attempted connection is from our home but the problem persists when we are out and about not at our home  Tried a Network Extender at home no help  Hours with tech support has produced little success  I have only 4 days left on the 14 day trial period  Im probably going to have to take them back and unwind the deal  They say they have a technical team working on the issue but I dont expect much from that

Again I LOVE everything about these machines except the connectivity problem with the phone section and that was the point of the purchase anyway  Wasnt it I originally switched over to this phone because I was trying to switch carriers and Verizon was out of stock on the iPhone SE Although I have always preferred Apple products I figured that Android must have come a long way since I last used their OS in 2012 and decided that Samsungs Galaxy S7 would be my best bet if I wanted the best Android had to offer The phone itself is gorgeous and Samsung did a really nice job with the overall feel and aesthetic of the phone I was so excited about it until I actually got my hands on it and poked around in the OS I mean seriously youd think after all this time that Android would learn something but at the end of the day the OS feels just the same as it did four years ago Bloated and slow Android fans boasted to me about how Samsungs new flagship has better specs than my iPhone 6s with its new processor and expandable storage  all those wonderful things I was really genuinely excited about the switch over thinking Id run into this blazing fast wonderful piece of art I couldnt have been more wrong My hat is off to Samsung for attempting to make a great phone but shame on Android for being such a slow pile of garbage If youre on the verge of switching if youre an iPhone user for any of the reasons I stated above better processormore RAMmore storage but you even remotely like iOS DO NOT switch It will be nothing but instant regret

I am going back today to return the phone and get another iPhone 6s I was hesitant to try a new Samsung phone but I am pleasantly pleasedo with it If I could improve one thing it would be the battery life Month 1 not very happy features S5 had that I liked the S7 does not have I cant use the voice text or I dont know how and on home screen it doesnt show rain drops of lightening Great phone Large bright screen nice sound from the small phone speaker thumbprint unlocking is GREAT split screen app usage is VERY useful and the build quality is second to none 

Ive never seen a phone battery charge this fast either  just amazingly fast Would prefer more initial organization of the app icons and if I alphabetize them and then add a new app  dont just jam the new app on the end of the list 

Im a fan of the back button on the bottom right side as well  seems like natural placement to me  at least for a righthanded person I have been using Samsung phones since the first Galaxy and as the rest this one does not disappoint It is both extremely visually appealing and powerful enough to handle what ever I throw at it I cant even begin to imagine how they are going to top this for the next model I also have a Galaxy Gear S watch that compliments the phone I am a proud Samsung owner and will carry the banner of this brand where ever I go One day after I win the lottery I will have a home completely furnished with Samsung products from the kitchen to the family room to the laundry room and every other room possible Been an awesome phone so far but need some more time to get used to it to give an honest review easy to use nice large screen Great camera Very expensive device not worth the price but overall Im satisfied very fragile Had for about 2 weeks and was an extremely easy transition from my old android Im a VR dev in New York and I absolutely love the S7 Edge The brightness and color of the display is perfect for mobile VR Phones great very reliable when i charge it in under 23 hours its already fully charge and lasts for maybe 811 hours depends on use plus it has ultra saving mode for the battery making it last longer traded up to the samsunggalaxy7 good phone still getting used to some of the features I purchased this phone and had to exchange it 2 times I am sooooo disappointed with this phone It makes no sense for us to pay so much for a phone and service and it doesnt work as intended This is my first smart phone so I dont have much to compare it to My friends that have iphones have played with it and really like it My wife says that my S7 takes much better pics than her iphone 6 I chose the S7 bc it is water resistant has expandable memory and has twice the battery of the iphone I love this phone may have been a bit pricey but well worth it I went from an s5 to the s7 and I have no complaints The design is pristine speed like lighting features well in blown away I will be telling all my friends and family that they really need this phone Best phone on the market yet I look forward to Samsungs future products I bought this phone less then two weeks and I do not like it at all Calls keeping getting dropped Service is poor I cant believe I chose this phone thinking it would be better So unhappy Even downloading the usual apps and they freeze up and stop responding No I am not in the country I am in the same area as I have always been with my other phone and have gotten better service All with Verizon but different phones This phone just not making it Why did I wait so long I really enjoy my new phone The cam is awesome great new features It feels good in your hand Still learning the phone Glad I got it Ive had my phone for a month works great never have any problems outstanding performance I recommend everyone get one This phone was an uograde for my Galaxy S5 totally uneccesary but i wanted the OLED screen and increased speed Screen looks nice And as time passes and i buy a new ohineeach time the setup initially gets easier This time it was a breeze Everyone said the s7 was bad and it wasnt worth it they were so wrong this phone is fast and amazing the features it has are awesome it is so small and light I love it Really love some of the new features  The clarity of the screen and the camera are a couple of my favoritestuff I love this phone I had the s4 for two years and it was a great phone but this phone is amazing My favorite thing is probably the voicemail feature The picture quality camera and battery life make it great I actually cant think of one thingI dont like If your thinking about getting a new phone get the S7 Easy to use and super fast I really fell in love with my new Galaxy s7 edge cell phone the minute I got it in my hand I love the designI love the lightness of itHas great featuresgreat performanceafter changing from Team iphone to Team galaxy I dont think I will go back and got not regret on my decisionIm still learning to play with it but every day I get more exited about my new toy I really like the phone but am still disappointed with the battery I am not a heavy user and yet it still barely lasts all day It does charge extremely fast so at least it doesnt take much time The camera is the best I have used on a phone I also like the location of the speaker Not having it on the back of the phone is a huge plus Nice addition to a great line of phones I would recommend this phone to everyone It is a great phone The Customer service is always top level  Its really easy to set up and get started  I really like the Milk Music app it comes with Upgraded week ago from Galaxy S4 love new phone Love it Easy transition from my old Galaxy with lots of great new fun features Easy transition and wonderful amount of storage I bought this phone a week agoI love it great features and speed I have been iPhone all the way for awhile The looks and features available with this phone stood out And Im very happy with my decision Fast reliable and the battery isnt half bad either Only reason not all 5 stars is price Probably could have been kinder to my account Overall definitely worth the extra Great phone except for three things  1 the recent and back buttons are reversed from any other phone I have used 2 I have to press either the home or power key to unlock it rather than swiping up 3 adaptive memory was omitted Couldnt be happier In one form or another Ive tried just about every possible phone manufacturer or model on the market before I found the Samsung Galaxy series of phones and what was already setting the industry standard for innovation design and functionality has actually surpassed itself with the S7 edge The rounded screen isnt just sleek and sexy but useful even when the screen is off providing tickerstyle sliding updates at a touch The same fantastic hardware you came to expect from its predecessor the S7 vanilla is still under the hood but with a significantly improved battery life to make the S7 edge the only truly mustown phone of 2016 Easy to use great camera love all the new features Getting one for the hubby next I love it  Easy to use and comfortable I love the features  with everything not active and no texting and no calls the battery is mostly gone within 24 hours okhad to replace a Galaxy 4 I bought it 2weeks agostill learnings awesome phone will recommend Love this phone and so happy I switched back from I phone Long lasting battery and no bologna I recently upgraded from the S4 The S7edge is so much better I love it The features on it are very user friendly and the screen has more clarity I especially love the camera and all of its options The camera zoom is very clear and the picture has a sharper image The design is very sleek and sexy Been using the new phone for almost a month and have had zero issues Its fast and so far has been a very nice upgrade from my S3 I love the finger print sensor  my first  its much more useful with various apps than I would have guessed The quick access camera shortcut is awesome as well and it takes wonderful photos Camera and super fast and clear

I have read other reviews about battery lifeI have had no issues at all My phone is used quite a lot throughout the day and I usually have about 40 left at night This phone has awesome features that allow us to use it for mobile viewing of Netflix Hulu etc I just bought the Samsung S7 a week ago and I love it   I previously had a Samsung S5 and the transition from the old to the new was so easy  Great phone and I highly recommend it I am enjoying this phone Having mobile access is nice The typing keyboard could be bigger but it is usable The camera takes really good pictures especially in low light Outstanding Had a Galaxy s5 now an s7 Transition was seamless and operation is nearly identical This phone is too large to stay in my pocket  It does not work like my previous Samsung Galaxy phone S4  I do like that it did not come with a lot of useless apps pre loaded I recently purchased a Samsung S7 Edge  which I have concluded is absolutely the best cell phone purchase Ive ever made Samsung included every feature imaginable in this slim phone including Always On and Edge Plus the display and camera are great I am very satisfied with the phone and have honestly not found anything about it that I dont like Would recommend it to anyone Way better than iPhone Best phone I have ever had The S7 is a great phone like my old S6 but the S7 does not allow you to add your on tonesound for text or email notifications I dont like having the same sound everyone else has For years with Iphones and androids I had a unique sound How do you say its a better phone when you take away instead of adding Another issue I have is I can no longer swipe across to delete my business email google you still can  I now need to tab the menu go to edit and then tab delete WHY more steps why not swipe delete like on gmail Enjoy my phone Still learning I am enjoying the S7 The new features are easy to use The Samsung galaxy s7 is the best phone I have had yet in design and better for me to see
and some of the new places you can go on the phone is great Got it a month ago and it is easy to useGlad I bought it Im so unhappy it been the second galexy s7 and there both messing up bad and glitches and screen going black apps not working I got the Samsung Galaxy S7 just a couple weeks ago and already love it  It is very user friendly and I would highly recommend it to anyone Overall the phone is a nice upgrade Still learning about all of the features Love the features of the phone and transition from my old phone was super easy  However it is a good thing the phone comes with a fast charger as the batter life is poor  Halfway through my day I am constantly at 50 or less  I expected and NEED my phone to be able to go at least 16 hours without needing a charge  Very frustrating I have always used other brands of devices through my life I never thought of switching to a Galaxy But I did after listening to a few friends I just wanted to try something new
I have had this phone since April 18th of 2016 and have absolutely loved it Everything about it is a solid 910 The display is beautiful the camera is indescribable its loaded with cool features and it is fast What more could you want from a smart phone The phone appeals to my personality perfectly With so many fun features that I have learned  have yet to learn It is the best We had a Samsung S5 so there wasnt a large learning curve  Great clarity and pictures are better  The battery life is not as good as the S5 and definitely requires improvement Great battery life I dont have to charge on a daily basis Display is impeccable Perfect size Best Galaxy ever Love Everything About It I am a a huge fan of Samsung products I traded my Galaxy S5 for the new Galaxy S7 I loved my Galaxy S5 But must stay with the times so I upgraded My new Galaxy S7 is amazingFast download speed  The camera is awesome I recommended to a co worker Her and her husband both upgraded from another brand phone to the Galaxy S7 and they are very happy people So if you are going to upgrade your phone I strongly recommend the Galaxy S7
Thank you Samsung for another great product so far it has been easy to use and a smooth transition from my previous phone I just love how easy to use and fast performing this phone is Im so glad I made the switch worth the upgrade The screen is great and so are the new features still trying to learn the phone but enjoying it Excellent phoneCamera is great Its worth the wait for meFrom S3 to S7wow what a difference Life in the army is fast paced mobile and constantly shifting The S7 keeps me connected with my soldiers maintaining accountability and connectivity to ensure operations run smooth and keeps me connected with my family across the world From managing my home my car to my email the S7 maintains my life and meets my demand excellently So far this has been the best product Samsung has released and when I want entertainment from HBO Now to the Gear VR there is no shortcomings I strongly recommend this product its really nice and great I have had the S7 for 2 weeks now What a difference from the S4 all for the good Im impressed with this phone granted I upgraded from a much older very slow smart phone  I really like the fingerprint unlock feature as it works very quickly when I need to access the phone  This phone runs very fast and efficiently and pairs extremely well with bluetooth devices I experienced my first HD phone call on it yesterday was quite please with the call quality  I am enjoying it
Recommendation In many reviews people talk about the back of it getting smudged with fingerprints very easily  This is true  I recommend getting a good cover for it  The one I got from Seidio is very well done and still allows the phone to be thin enough easily fit in my pocket  A cover also makes it easier to hold This phone like its predecesors is beyond great Excellent for me I used this product for more the 5 years I purchased my first Galaxy S5 phone and was really pleased with it It was time to upgrade and I was excited to hear they brought back the waterproof and expandable memory with the S7 This phone is the best mobile device out there The pictures it takes is far superior to others I tried I like the extra features the Edge model offers The display is dynamic and a work of beauty I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to purchase their next mobile device I love my new phone but am having problems with data and my wifi staying connected I will be going the store today to see if they can help me Just upgraded my phone The sice is good Charges much faster The picture quality is quite good Very easy to transfer info from old phone This new S7 Edge is by far the best phone Ive owned my last one was a S4 and this was a big surprise to me to see all the new features Samsung hes incorporated into this phone I would go as far assaying that it is like a mini computer with all it can do I inserted a new 128GB Sandisc SD card for extra space and it works great 
No regrets Thanks Samsung
David I got this 2 weeks ago and so far Im loving it The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a beautiful device that exudes quality Although it is a high tier device it is an exceptional value I have been a Samsung user sing the galaxy S1 I was disappointed with the S6 but much happier with the S7 I miss the IR blaster that was in my S5 but I can live without it If the S7 had an IR blaster and a removable battery it would be 5 stars across the board for me battery life is quite good under moderate to heavy usage and it recharges very quickly the low light camera is nothing short of awesome The speaker is much better than my previous phone the S5 Glad its not a rear facing speaker Easy to use and quick running product I was a competitors user and I cant say that I wont go back but Samsung Galaxy 7 is a very good phone they really step it up when it comes to each new phone Ive had galaxy phones for years wouldnt go to another The 7 is the best yet Was able to add the apps I could not on my old phone It was only 8 GB and no way to add more This Phone is Fire I think I found the one I will have for ever it will take a bomb for me to get another phone I have had a Samsung for years and this S7 is the best so far We bought 4 for the family and 2 had I phones Looks like we have 2 new galaxy user for keeps Worst part is placement of keys I rest my thumb at bottom of phone which is where the back button and speaker is and it is very touchy so its aggravating Seems like they needed to do more trials with different people Better service then previous Takes great photos and very fast operation and enjoy the screen Just got my phone one week ago and am still discovering all the special features it has Pictures are great I bought this product on may 7th and Im very happy with it love it I have iPhone 6 Got the S7 for my son I love apple but I have to admit the S7 is pretty phenomenal I had the Samsung Galaxy 5 and wanted to upgrade to the S7 edge I got the Samsung S7 edge in Gold platinum and I love it The battery life is amazing and it also comes with a fast charging charger I also love how fast it downloads The size of the phone is perfect Ive had this phone for about a week It has been easy to transition from my old phone I really like the screen Its easy to use and the features are great I love my samsung easy to use has a lot of features that are easy to do Great phone Wont break if dropped Can be dropped in water and it wont hurt it very easy to use I love the Galaxy phones I have an upgrade and am looking to learn more about the phone This phone is great Its fast and easy to use The only phone I will ever buy is a Samsung Got this for mothers day and it doesnt get more than 1 bar of signal most days Took it to the store contacted Samsung no one knows why Never dropped a call ever with my s4 upgraded and cant hold a conversation Everything else about it is nice I absolutely love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 The camera is one of the best features on the phone and the sleek sophisticated look is a Go I also like that the phone has 32 GB of storage plus you can add an SD card to enjoy more storage The S7 is a must have Lots of really cool features I recently upgraded to the S7 and so far it has been great Was able to transfer all of my apps and other data from my old phone making the transition seamless Phone has some great features for durability as well I have a problem with video when I look the phone stop playing Ive always had Samsung phones Each one gets better and better This phone has been awesome Easy to use and very functional  I just got mine Wow is all I can say Thank you VERIZON I replaced my Galaxy S5 with this newer model Although the phone has a lot of nice features they still load apps that I would rather remove but cantake Idont also like for the battery to last longer I absolutely love this phone Easy to use great screen size and resolution The camera is awesome

Thank you Review period about 1 week
THE GOOD
Video calling  Samsung S Health custom sound for your ears only where you can set the phone to your hearing capabilities  sounds awesome
Resolution of screen  colors Awesome

THE BAD
Like the phone and some featuredapps but man does this thing heat up
Being in Arizona doesnt help any either Have to drill down all the apps power save mode battery usage optimized Screen brightness to at least be able to use the phone  have it go the entire day

ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES
Havent gotten the VR headset yet but have tried it out in Best Buy
Pretty cool Watch for all the S health  related apps though not into having something like that touch my skin all the time Radio waves ie SAR Kind of allergic to Bluetooth nasty migraines

BOTTOM LINE
Not a bad phone but due to the heat issues battery life and trying to figure out what app is taking up all the juice on this thing is a little much for me Shouldnt have to figure out what apps causing my phone to be constantly running in the background
Best advise  look up complaints online to verify you can deal with any purchase you decide Going to Bestbuy to see if someone from Samsung can help me figure this out app issue or possibly phone issue out
My next purchase will depend on the outcome of the above Very fast no problems so far i am very happy with it Bought this phone 2 weeks ago and yet have to discover all this phone has to offer The slick design brilliant screen ease of use and its compatibility is top of its market You can definitely personalize to you and make your own for sure Sleek and hot performance Best phone yet I understand why some iPhone users are going to the s7 Phone is great Keep up the good work I really appreciate the SD card but wish it had a reachable battery too All in all great phone I would do it again I love this phone What more is there to say Great interface good options I am learning more and more each day Very fast and customizable I got this phone as a gift and I love it Love the new phone All the new features work great and the battery life is awesome Happy with the phone I preordered the S7 edge and got Gear VR free with the device perfectly worthy for the price I used this device for 2months now and so far absolutely zero problems

Must buy smartphone for the year 2016 I read reviews before making this purchase and seen a lot of batteryou life complaints I dont have any complaints This phone is AMAZING I upgraded last week from my S4 to the S7 Was so glad I waited and didnt do the S5 or S6 wanted to keep my SIM card for pic storage Major improvements I am thrilled with it Still getting used to change battery life could be better Screen too sensitive to any touch even with fingers used to hold the phone Battery life horrible even after changing settings Easy transition from my old phone 32 gb of storage is a major plus I bought it a month ago and it is useful Would love to know how to use the phone better it will come with time and use This phone has so many features easy to set up and takes great pictures Just got phone about a week ago I love this phone it feels nice in your hands I love that its water proof It has so many great features The camera is seriously my most favorite it is such a great camera so crisp and clean Overall I like the phone Build quality is good Samsung touchwiz has been drastically reduced and is no longer as present as before which is a good thing Camera is very solid and the phone feels good in hand The waterproof rating is nice to have but I havent had any reason to test it yet The biggest complaint for me is battery life is still subpar Using it somewhat frequently wont get me through a day and I still find myself reaching for the charger half way through every single day Not including USB TypeC was a disappointment but Im sure they had to leave something for the Galaxy S8 Love my phone its water proof and easy to use great features on it S7 edge is a great phone Camera performance and features are great Phone is super fast and responsive Crystal clear audio great resolution on screen Overall a great phone the HD screen is vivid I had an S5 and it was great I did not get an S6 because they removed the ability to add more storage via mini SD card The S7 has this now and all the featuresincluding the Edgeare great I hope they have more enhancements for the Edge down the road

Get one you wont regret it its fast has a beautiful screen resolution and isnt too big I am a truck driver and I can use my bluetooth to start Pandora or other apps like my navigation without touching the phone I bought the phone about 3 weeks ago and I am so happy I did It is user friendly and the perfect size the product is decent but there are a few things that could be improved Great phone Better than iphone Extremely satisfied with this product would recommend I was struggling with a phone that the functions were not working consistantly My Samsung S7 works very well I love the phone and anything dealing with Samsung This is the best Galaxy ever Its a little pricey but well worth it Had phone for a week and the battery dies faster than my 2 year old s5 Only complaint with the phone I had wandered over to another brand about 3 years ago frustrated with the lack of innovation asthetic design at Samsung and annoyed by the bloated TouchWiz interface The s6 caught my attention and the S7 finally made me take the plunge Boy am I glad I did 

This phone has all the features I could have imagined in a phone and on top of it all it looks simply beautiful Everyone comments on how good it looks whenever I use it or just set it on the table

But the best part if the phone has rock solid performance and tremendous battery life 

I love it I have only had my Samsung Galaxy S7 for a couple of weeks now but i love it It is so much better than my old Samsung Galaxy S5 I love all the new features and design of this phone I am a big android fan I love this phone Everything about is good Would recommend it to everyone I admit I had not really exceeded the limits of my Galaxy S4 but I wanted to upgrade so that I could run the latest softwareplus I was bumping up against storage limits every couple of months or so This Galaxy S7 brings back the microSD card option and that was a big seller for me Also I rarely used the lock screen on my old phone but the fingerprint unlock has me convinced Im not a natural photographer so any help I can get with an improved camera is welcome The water resistance is comforting but not really why I bought the phone Finally the fast charging has really eliminated my major phone problem  I know this is available on some earlier models but not with the microSD added storage I like the screen but not really seen much difference yet from the Samsung I had Reluctantly had to upgrade to the S7 from the S6 after losing my phone


Good improvement good features better battery life and quicker charging Very well designed Its beautiful and very smart All my electronics are Samsung Wouldnt have it any other way Thank You  The display and phone and camera are fantastic Somewhat pushed the phone out a little too early and did check compatibility with many popular apps especially Facebook I am eagerly awaiting the update that will resolve these flaws I got this because it is the latest Samsung and because I have the Note 3 and loved the NOte 3 I am disappointed with the Edge if you have to touch the edge it is difficult because of the cool curve Also in contacts I dont have mine as first like the note 3 lists difficult to find phone info especially mine screen in smaller than note 3 so wonder what was with all the hype just marketing hate that they put the annoying Direct tv app on that continually bugs you This is my first Android phone I was worried that it would be really hard to get used to but its really easy to navigate There are so many more ways to customize and personalize than with my iPhone The only negative thing Ive noticed is that some of my frequently used apps are different on Android I guess thats not necessarily a bad thing just takes some getting used to Simple easy to use phone that seamlessly transitions from the prior smartphone Keep the same name and operating system Love the feel and the designew of the S7 Accessing my most used apps via the Edge Screen is extremely efficient The quality of the camera is exceptional Split screen capability also helps with effectiveness and efficientcy by allowing me to view 2 apps at the same time Quick connect feature also allows me to share informationot with like devices easily and quickly Being water proof is a big plus for clumsy people like me 
Overall very satisfied with the phone Great phone Great phone Great phone Great phone Great phone This phone is even better than the Galaxy S6 I did think they could make it better I love all of the features of the phone I especially love some of the apps that are specifically either for this phone or samsung products I love video calling and being able to charge wirelessly It works well with my Samsung gear s2 watch I started with the GalaxyS3 then went to the Galaxy S5 and now the Galaxy S7 I love this phone I considered the S6 when it came out but changed my mind as it didnt have the removable Micro SD card slot They brought it back in the S7 Transferring everything from the S5 to the S7 was so easy and great This phone lives up to the Great Galaxy reputation I would recommend this phone to everyone whether and android or apple users I have quite a few people ask me about the phone when they find out what i have and I tell them it is well worth purchasing I have small hands and I love that the screen area has not shrunk but the width and thickness of the phone has I have a much easier time holding the S7 Best phone by Samsung yet love it Two days ago I updated from a S4 to a new S7 not realizing features that I enjoyed and liked on Samsung S4 are no longer available on new S7 I wouldnt have upgraded to new phone The camera on this phone is stunning its a must have You can even get it in RAW file for perfect photo editing The phone is a good buy but a bit pricey I think its worth it though Everything about this phone is amazing I doubted Samsung for a while due to past experiences but give them another chance and I couldnt be happier Love the low light camera Everything about this phone is everything youd expect from a device of this value which I cant say the same about any other device at this point Samsung won me back Best cell phone I have ever owned great features easy to understand Would recommend this phone to everyone wanting a top of the line phone Got ATT service no problems love it This phone is amazing I love the camera I also lije the way it operates Loved my S6 Edge Plus was kinda upset a new S7 came out so quick after purchasing my S6EdgePlus But hey gotta pay to play I love this one even though the display is a bit smaller than the previous i dont notice it And it feels better in hand 

Cant wait for 8

Oh Samsung you can use that slogan I just need a spot in the commercial a new S8 and some accessories I love all the features on the phone like being able to take front photos with the touch sensor on the back The screen is very clear and great for movies The headphones could better I wanted to wait a little longer but glad that I did not I finally upgraded from Galaxy S5 I skipped the S6 because it did not have key features to me ie external memory card and water resistance Which my S5 had This time they got it right Excellent installment of the Galaxy S series I just purchased a few weeks ago and love my new Samsung enjoying its features I have never owned a Samsung phone before this one and Im really excited about this phone The different camera modes this phone has is a photographer dream This camera has so many features I cant begin to explain them all Samsung Galaxy S7 is over the top I was hesitant to get the S7 Edge due to disappointment with the S6 Primarily the battery life I would have to charge 2 to 3 times a day Now I get a day per charge and by day I mean 24hrs The phone is incredibly fast smooth beautiful and fixes the issues from last years model I almost waited for the iPhone 7 in September but I took a chance and it paid off big Thanks Samsung for getting it right I went from a Note 4 to the S7 While it was great in every area I needed a bigger phone I returned it for the S 7 Edge and its everything I expected 

I have bigger hands so maybe the size isnt an issue for me like other people I use my phone often for work so I prefer the larger screen for writing emails using the calendar and viewing documents S7 suppose to be the newest and greatest  dont bother to buy this junk I just upgraded from the s5 and I havent really noticed any new features yet Theres no learning curve which is nice and it runs faster Just bought this phone two weeks ago and it was able to transfer everything over I do wish the keyboard was bigger but thats it Its super easy to use and keep getting better as I go on Everyone should have this phone I love this phone so far Pricy but its great to work with Im happy I bought this phone 4 days ago and am already disgusted with it It is slower than my S3 when you try to open it all screens are slow to load I havent found where I can add attachments to text messagesthe list goes on and on

I asm seriously considering returning this phone and canceling my Verizon service before the 14 days are up The best phone its so Ezra to use and navigateso happy Upgraded from 5 to 7 Slow speed poor memory and constant crashing to new a few problems I am very happy the additional easy functions and additional ways to use my phone The device is sleek and responsive butthe battery life is significantly problematic worse than my two year old S5 battery difficult to believe that after all this technology advancement battery life would be so short Im not crazy about how the gallery does not have a option to hide your photo albums Other than that the phone is ok I which wastes an ancient Droid 4 with the new Samsung S7 I also have a Samsung S6 addigned by my company Yes 7 is noticeably faster and its fingerprint unlock function works perfectly I like this product I have suggested it to my friends and family Upgrade to get a better camera and that it is I bought this last week and it works great I love the screen protector and the charger Super easy to use Super happy great camera quality I got this phone a week ago and have had problems already with it not working right Most of the time it wont let me refresh my Facebook account so I can see new posts It tells me to check my internet settings so I have to restart the phone for it to work from the app but i works perfectly through google I took it in and the lady checked the settings and said they were good She uninstalled the FB app and reinstalled it and told me to try it for a bit but it did it again when I tried a couple hours later I hope to be able to get a new phone and not an insurance one as they are worse I originally didnt want to get the edge because I thought the screen would crack easily But now after having the phone I love the edge panel and the features available with the phone a little expensive but a good purchase Finally upgrades from my trusty S4 What an amazing phome Best one out there Not disappointed by anything on it Highly recommended The galaxys7 is bigger more functions and a better camera The camera has far exceeded my expectations There are so many different settings and the picture quality is amazing The Galaxy 7 is the best update ever I love the simplicity of using the icons and ease of downloading new applications Transferring information from old phone to the new phone was a breeze I love my phone Im a picture taker and I love its camera Although its behind on some of the app updates its a good phone I was going to switch not until someone else had this phone and I played with and and I feel inlove with it I have so far love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The only lyrics thing I wished it had more storage instead of having to buy another SD card The only complaint I have about the S7 is the feature that allowed me to block any calls that werent in my contact list I had this feature on my S3mini and used it everyday it kept away the annoying telemarketers calls from ringing my phone Wish there was an app that I could download to replace this missing feature Other than that really love the phone Everything about this phone sets the bar on phone expectations with a few minor exceptions 1 Hate that you cant remove the battery 2 The sd memory card slot can be annoying if you ever lose the little tool 3 Wish the screen was a little more durable None of these are real deal breakers overall great phone Samsung has really outdone themselves with this phone I have taken photos that Id never imagine Id take with a cell phone The HD phone calls come in clear and I can always hear who Im talking to perfectly I really dont have anything negative to say about the phone There are the occasional hiccups due to apps and Android but the phone itself is awesome I feel like they are making the Galaxy series more complicated and cheaper material design Nothing new in the pros of the Galaxy series but not having a removable battery is a major con Also very difficult to addremove sd memory card if you were to lose the small tool they give you The screen design is much more fragile than it should be for the cost of the phone The phone even has a naturally heavier feel than most On the internal workings of the phone it works great like the previous Galaxy phones Its the exteriorand lack thereof that is a let down I have been an avid Samsung Galaxy follower since the S2 Skyrocket and finally kicked the KoolAid habit This new S7 is great as it brought back the external memory that was a game changer for me and the water proof I honestly do not like all of the new features in the OS such as the removal to set a selection as default or Just Once I loved that feature now if you select something it makes it the default whether you like it or not and I hope to see that one small yet VERY IMPORTANT feature return In my situation I use RingCentral in my business and it integrated with the phone so that every time i dialed a number a popup would ask me if I wanted to set it as the default or Just Once there are many times that I do not want my cell number to display and have my office number display and the convenience has been removed of just using my phone which is now referred to as Contacts I have to do it the Apple KoolAid way and open the RingCentral App and dial from there quite an inconvenience as I could use my contacts when I had the per dial choice instead of the OS now deciding that every time I make a choice that it will be the choice that I would make EVERY time the access authorization by application is a little too granular now as well almost too cumbersome Other than that little vent it is a ROCKING phone and I will recommend it to all that will listen I just hope that Samsung takes into consideration of adding back that wee little selection of Always or Just Once for more flexibility of the usage of the phone instead of having to look through the overly granular setting defaults to try to undo or change something but completely consider myself a Samsung Shop BTW I immediately put in the 200 GB Micro SDXC and have my 60 GB music library there with so much room to spare  so Awesome Thank you Samsung I live this phone because of its great features and design
Its not too big no too small
I cant wait until i get the smart watch for it the phone is really nice has great features its light weight the battery last for more then 3 hours best one yet I would like to say that this phone has the best futures ever and with water prof that is good too I am a Samsung customer and I was previously using the Note 5 and when I saw and the saw the S7 
Edge I upgrade right away from Note 5 to S7 Edge so I really reccomend the phone to anyone I love everything about this phone from the features to the design I have always used a Samsung phone but this is by far the best one I have used One of my favorite things about it is the water proof design and how fast the operating system is I also am in love with the camera I was originally a iPhone user and now will never go back I love the options and customization I get with the S7 The screen is crystal clear and sharp battery has a good life camera takes great pictures in low light compared to my Girlfriends iPhone 6s and its expandable memory was a must for myself with pictures and music I couldnt ever imagine going back to an iPhone after this purchase I would highly recommend the S7 to anyone Love how quick the battery recharges and how long it lasts I switched from the iphone I have had nothing but troubles with every iphone I get Many friends love theirs so I must have just been unlucky The transition to a Galaxy S7 has been good So far I really love it and find it pretty easy to use I had an S4 for 3 years and decided to try this The camera is not very great I go to a lot of concerts and I saw a guy with an S6 take amazing photos at the show so I figured the S7 must be better but it is not The edge display really isnt good for much Just seems like they wanted it to look slick and all it did is make is slippery so that unless you have a case itll slip out of your hand If you want a S7 stick with the regular and do not get an Edge I learned my lesson Ill just have to wait to get a new one I guess This phone has all sorts of cool features like the Samsung Pay fast processor awesome camera easy interface and a host of other features I love that its waterproof Cmon Who wouldnt love that feature I once dropped my LG3 phone in the toilet and it was pretty much toast Now dont get me wrong its gross but stillI dont have to go through the whole rigmarole of getting it replaced Just let it dry Febreze and clean the heck out of it and BAM Ready to roll
Love love love this phone The download speed is unbelievable the video quality is unbeatable the phone general design is beyond my expectations best phone on the market I can not say enough how much I LOVE this phone For someone that is in the older generation it is very easy to use Thats probably one of the best things about this phone Also it takes AWESOME pictures For me I have yet to find anything about this phone I dont like So happy there is a phone like this on the market So far my S 7 has been a big improvement over my S3 which lasted 3 12 years The only thing I am not pleased with is that there is no removable battery very unfortunate Ive had my S7 for 3 months and I like the features Ive been android user for many years I like the look and feel of the phone Im maybe an average user or maybe a little less and the battery can be drained by about 4 or 5 pm I expected to be able to go a full day on a charge but not the case Even with all the battery saving modes it still cant make it much past around 5 Good phone wish had better battery life Much better then any phone Ive had doesnt give me any problems battery life is awesome much more durable love it I have had nearly the entire series of Samsung phones and they just keep getting better The S7 is lightweight slim with a fantastic screen The camera is great sound is great The transfer of my information from my old S5 to the S7 was a breeze with the transfer connector Havent had to use it yet but its great thats its waterproof I like having the micro SD card because I take a lot of pictures Its water proof and the camera is great Love the phone I upgraded from the Galaxy Note 4 I absolutely live my s7 edge It is capable of so much more than i will ever need but the things i do use are by far the best ever on this phone Bought it a week ago So far so good on all angles and aspects This phone is sleek It is packed with a crazy processor and a amazing camera The screen on this is beutiful Walked in with a question about storage on my old S5 and found it advantageous to roll into a new S7 Not only did I get credits for the S5 but I also received great help in the store Galaxy S7 Edge for me was a great decision because I usually find myself going along with the Galaxy S the edge for me as more features and of course the display is larger and for me its a well rounded phone that fit my needs beyond that I can imagine The ultimate upgrade Love this phone This phone is helping me keep track of my health issues and so much more I can track my fitness listen to my tunes stay connected and increase my knowledge Love this phone Coming from a Note 4 huge improvement on battery life Very thankful for expandable storage making a comeback almost had to move away from Samsung Also very appreciative of the IP68 water resistance feature huge bonus with life being so unpredictable Curved edges are cause for concern especially as cases have to be manufactured around the curves and significantly reduce effectiveness Had it almost a month will update at the 6 month mark with more details I would recommend anyone to get this phone Its the best Is my first galaxy I always had htc phones and I love my new galaxy This phone has great features and at the top of that list would be the water resistant design see specs for details which is why I purchased it I was thinking this phone was durable like my S5 but its not The phone is very fragile like an IPhone If you dont have a case or screen protector your phone is as good as gone if it drops Minus that I love the feauters of the new phone I absolutely love everything about this phone I dont regret anything about it I bought this 2weks Im very happy An amazing upgrade So happy I went with this phone  This is probably the best smartphone I have ever owned I wish the screen responded better Overall good phoneLOVE that is has a SD CARD DRIVE Love the camera and the extra storage A phone Lightweight and durable Love my new cell phone and everything is does First started with the s3 followed by the s4 and I was way behind in technology and decided to make that jump to the s7 Im so glad I got this phone From the overall screen resolution to the responsive key pad love it And the pics taken with this phone are far superior to any other phone Ive had Ive had it for two weeks Everything about this phone is substantially better than my previous phone I miss not having an HDMI port though Very happy with the service and the capabilities of the phone Love the functionality of this phone it can merge with several devices This is by far my favorite Samsung phone Everything is AMAZING on it The phone has great features It is quick and easy to use but for the money may not all I hoped for very good display great definition and color brightness Best phone I have ever had It functions perfect I like that you can text while doing another app without having to close it out to go read I love everything about this phone the color how smart it is also every feature about this phone has me smiling from eartoear My new Samsung 7s is the best phone ever So far the best phone Ive ever operated still learning to use it its really cool and I just got the wireles charger which is really good too I absolutely love this phone Its faster than my last Samsung and theres so much feature to this phone love my new phone better than Iphone in my book This device is very useful in everyday life It can help you with almost any problem you encounter though out your day Awesome screen quality fastest processor ive enjoyed Movies are something else the screen is what grabs you first its about as sharp as any screen Ive ever seen Next is how smooth apps work on this rockstar no lag quick switching back and forth between multiple open apps Sound quality is fantastic voices sound clear and loud I really love the edge notifications when my screen is locked too All around a real winner for Samsung The camera alone is amazing Best smartphone ever Incredibly satisfied with the addition of the MicroSD card back on the device Who wants to limit what they put on their phones Still getting use to the curved edge of the screen but I think itll be mastered soon 5star phone for a 5star user Took me a little while to get used to where features and buttons were located compared to my old phone However overall its much better My only complaint is that there is no setting I can change to keep sms programs from turning screen on when I get a message The galaxy s7 is truly an amazing phone its fast lightweight and feels amazing in the hand its the best phone Ive ever owned but it has 1 major flaw that almost made me return it and that was the black screen of death Ive factory reset this phone 3 times so far because 3 different times its happened hopefully it wont again and just a minor inconvenience is the Samsung music player isnt on the phone you have to go to Samsung app store and download it overall I love the phone Waited and waited for a Galaxy phone to come out with expandable memory and then the S7 came out Very happy with its similarities with my old S4 but even more pleased with the camera and speed Happy purchase I have owned the S7 for a month now I like the features and have used some of the installed apps The display has great quality for watching videos and excellent stereo sound quality My only issue is that I did enjoy the size of the S4 mini I previously had Fit easily in a chest pocket This phone only fits in my rear pants pocket with a otter case on it I love this phone Its so fast It takes great pictures and video Its a great phone all around for work I can read an email while a call is coming in Or read an email and text at the same time Great phone for my busy schedule and work Have had mobile phones for over 40 years and I am now seeing the power of mobile A great life style changing device and experience Very fast and has a lot of great features best phone yet I came from an S6 which lasted only about 10 minutes when running virtual reality applications with the Gear VR before it overheated The S7 solved this problem I havent had problems with overheating yet Im sure I will be able to get it to overheat but it doesnt happen by far as often Other than that I like that its waterproof for peace of mind and the slightly curved screen of even the nonedge phone makes it looks more premium than the S6s complete flat display The only thing I liked better about the S6 was that I could get it with up to 128 GB of internal memory Its so much easier to deal with internal memory than an SD card My S7 has 32GB internal and it took me some time to set up the most storage hungry apps to use the SD card because that isnt the default I bought it a week ago I used to use galaxy s4 and s7 is so much greater than the s4 The camera is great There are many options to take picturesThe sound is nice and loud I like how i can use fingerprint to unlock the phone Oh and the battery life is way longer compared to s4 The best part is I can customize many things I can change the theme size of the keyboard size of the screen etc And the phone itself is pretty so i just got a clear phone case I didnt check the waterproof because im afraid it might work But I really like my phone And my friend got this phone too after using mine for a day I purchased two phones to replace our ancient basic phones This is our first smartphone The setup was easy and the design is great We were able to use it right away It is pretty straight forward and easy to understand the instructions 
My one issue right now is that the touch screen is very sensitive They should make a way to adjust the sensitivity I recently got out from under the massive boulder I have been living under and upgraded from my antiquated S4 to this shiny new S7 and WOW Why was I wasting so much time waiting for apps to load and videos to buffer This thing is lightening quick and does more than I ask it to do A Samsung Keep up the good work I like it better than the S6 too much like an iPhone because I was able to put my SD card back on it with all my pictures and music just missed the IR fixture for remote control for TVs and exedra I havent had it that long but I love the features and design I am still finding features every day I went from the 5 to the 7 just how it worked out in terms of 2 year contract The battery and speed on the 7 is so much better than the 5 I love the fingerprint access ability The size is also very manageable Im also glad they went back to making it water resistance I have no idea why that was left off of the 6

The headphone jack on the bottom did take a little getting used to only because when at the gym I I dont wear it but rather just put my phone on the shelf or in the cup holder of the cardio equipment that Im on Great memory space responds great to everything I needed from a phone I would highly recommend this to anyone else in need of a good phone I opened up new service last month and I was so impressed with the phone and also with Verizons Customer Service Great Job My Galaxy S7 has so far been the best phone Ive used in a long time I used to have an iPhone and made the switch to Galaxy S4 Fell in love with it 

Time for an upgrade and I saw the S7s being installed This phone is absolutely thrilling Its compatible with everything I need to do 

The wireless charging saves the wear and tear on my charging port My battery lasts almost all day The low light camera takes stunning pictures and when its sunny out the pictures are even better

When giving my son a bath I dont mind having my phone in my pocket He splashes about and I get wet I can pull out my phone with no worries of  oh no it got wet 

I dont fawn over technology often but my experience with the Galaxy S7 Ive never had a better time

Thank you for making a product that fits my lifestyle I can capture moments with my family whether its light or dark out and even when its raining This phone is superb in all aspects Quality wise excellent So fast elegant in appearance and fantastic performance Thank you Samsung  more power I owned a Galaxy S3 and couldnt wait to get this Phone This was an upgrade from an S4 which I must say is a major upgrade I really like that it has a memory card feature for pics videos and can also store some of my apps The AMOLED screen has incredible detailpicture and the camera on this phone is outstanding I really like the smooth movement feature on the camera for taking clear pictures The battery lasts amazingly long between recharges and I am very happy I waited to upgrade to this phone The Samsung Galaxy S7 is definitely one of the best Android phones available Operation is flawless and the phone also looks great with beautiful quality and craftsmanship Ive owned Samsung products for years the galaxy S7 is the best phone on the market Hands Down We bought 2 Samsung S7s One of them has had problems just suddenly going to a black screen We could hear the phone ringing  notifications coming in but unable to respond with no visual This has happened 34 times in the past 2 12 weeks I have had it We called Verizon support  found out what to do Apparently after looking online we found that some of the S7s do have this problem it wasnt just ours The phone itself is amazing Lots of features that didnt take too long to learn how to use Camera  audio are fantastic Battery life is really good The screen does seem extra sensitive We put a Zagg glass screen protector on one but still sensitive One of my game apps wont pull up sometimes I have to restart phone That is the only app I seem to have trouble with with the new phone So far ram and memory with addtl sd card are great Still playing with my new toy I discover something new it can do everyday I switched to the s7 and love it I owned a note2 before and loved it also The screen is so bright and clear Overall a great phone Its the best samsung galaxy yet I have owned a galaxy from the s3 mini s4 s5 now the s7 edge I couldnt be more pleased The s7 edge has been fantastic so far Right out of the box I was able to sync all of my information and settings very easily and quickly The rounded back is better than the s6 edge plus Feels better to hold and easier The slightly smaller size is also better Battery life is impressive Fast charging is fantastic Great picture quality Finger print scanner has improved as well I love the S7 and its features the waterproofing the camera megapixels and I am in love with MILK I hear all my jams at work I switched from an iPhone 5c to the Samsung s7 edge I could not be happier I love everything about it and it has been fun learning how to use something other than the iPhone The fact that it is water safe is a good thing for me as I have dropped several phones in the toilet I have heard that if the screen breaks its not cheap to fix so I invested in a case and am currently waiting on the tempered glass curved screen saver to be released I will definitely put one of those on All in all I love the phone and an certainly glad I took the plunge ha and switched from iPhone For the short time Ive had this phone is have noticed much improvement from my galaxy s5 The speed of this phone is excellent The only issue Im having is the blue tooth connection Randomly disconnects with any blue tooth device Overall its good nice features great performance but only one thing i noticed there is no built in media player i think the player from S5 is still better just saying my own opinion Ive only had the phone for a week or so and so far so good Still learning new features and experimenting with the awesome camera The only problem Im having is getting the text message alert and the default notifications working properly The Samsung Galaxy S7 is great From the camera to its performance The phone is very easy to use And taking advantage of all its perks it will only enhance your love for Samsungs products I have yet to connect it to other Samsungs products however very eager to Cause it deserves to be used to its full potential with other Samsungs products I truly recommend this Grand Phone of this generation I have used all most every Samsung phone and this is there topnotch device highly recommended to all Was looking forward to camera upgrade and was happy it met my expectations I love this phone It is easy to use and is not heavy The screen is a bit extra sensitive to touch but easy to get used to I would recommend a case for protecting the screen because nothing is perfect and it can still crack Really debated for a long time between Samsung S7 and iPhone 6S and have experience with both So glad I chose the S7 It does everything I need and more Love the camera it takes great pictures The expandable memory is also great Its easy to use and the battery life is just fine The only thing I would like to see would be the handsfree option of the S3 and S5where it had the option to read aloud your text messages and the sender of the message The samsung galaxy s7 is a great advancement to the future This phone is the greatest thing to human kind This is a great phone because you have all the greatest newest featurs including android pay and samsung pay This phone is compatible to everything from paying at the grocery store to accedentally dropping it into a small pool I would recomend this phone to everyone who isnt sure weather they want to buy it or not I used to love another company but now i am in love with samsung Thank you samsung I recently purchased the Galaxy S7 Edge and Ive owned it for about a month The camera is amazing in any setting Im in the battery is perfect for me since Im always on the go and it allows for fast charge so I can stay on the move With all the features of the current phones on the market I can communicate efficiently with all devices new and old Definitely one of the best purchases Ive made this year Thanks again Samsung I really just love the Samsung brand Have had several over my years of owning a phone I have to admit that my S7 Edge is by far the best smartphone Ive owned From unpackaging until now there have been few problems with the phone I use it for nearly all my Internet and entertainment needs and look forward to using my phone for at least the next two years I love all the Samsung Galaxy phones but the S7 is awesome I love the it is water resistant is easy to use has an amazing camera and the list goes on Love it  I made the switch from an iphone to android I absolutely love everything about the Samsung 7 It does so much more than the iphone I love the fact that I can pretty much sync my Samsung Tablet and Samsung 7 together The size of the screen is great the thinness of the phone is perfect too Android has me sold esp on the Samsung 7 The best phone I had ever the camera is really good is light and easy to use Battery takes to long to charge for the length of use And the phone is fragile it cracks very easy I really love this phone I recently had a Galaxy lll and were pleased with it When the time came to upgrade I went with the iphone WRONG choice i wasent pleased with it sent it back in a flash I said then i have got to get another Samsung Galaxy so i purchased a 6 and the 7  And my husband an I LOVE THEM I love this phone the features are amazing I also love that it is waterproof and it is so easy to use Ive had all the galaxy series and this is best one I can remember Fast processor memory card just runs smooth I absolutely love it teamsamsung Excellent phone my only disappointmentioned is in the signal it receives It is weaker than the s6 What they did right 
1 Battery life seems to be significantly better than the S4 or S6
2 Bumping the Device Memory to 32GB helps
3 SIM capacity for 128GB
4 Display is best yet
5 Watertight design doesnt require plugs

Disappointments
Still too much junk software you cant delete Still too much software that cant be moved to SIM I have only used Samsung products and i can tell you none is yet to top this phone I love my new s7 I have recommended this phone to all the people I know that like android phones I have had 6 friends get either the s7 or the s7edge Phone features are good and overall I use for systems at work boiler and lights control very good navigation on phone quick too I just recently upgraded from the Galaxy S5 Active to the Galaxy S7 Edge 

I havent had any disappointments with this phone the only thing that I can say is that I would do wish that it did have the rubber charger port cover like the S5 Active

I love the S7 I have no complaints about it The camera takes beautiful clear pictures the frontend camera too Most amazing phone Feels nice Looks nice Works great The looks the style the easy step by step transfer and walk through to bring my old pics and data to the new phone was awesome 
Step by step instructions to transfer to my new phone easy to use software  faster charging time longer battery life awesome camera  For all of these reasons I love this phone I had the galaxy 4 This is definitely faster Battery lasts longer Doesnt last a full day with heavy use Lasts probably 10 hrs heavy use for me which is a lot better for me It is nice to finally have blue tooth up to date again Great camera Sound is better Good screen size Havent tested out the water resistance I like that it is really competitive with the other big brand I can unlock with finger print There is less wasted space on screen I dont like the bottom left corner button it now turns it so you close screens The middle button if you press and hold turns to an OK Google  screen which seems useless Not intuitive how to make folders for organizing apps used to be easy still cant do it Overall good phone Exquisite design great quality and an amazing cameravideo You wont wonder did I settle for something less I change from the S6 edge and I dont regret it at alltotally in love wit here this one Samsung has the most premium products out there and this phone is no exception This phone has not let me down I am really diggin the Edge feature still getting used to it but I really like it Samsung makes life easier in a rush worldThank you Samsung I love the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It is fast slim it has a high quality screen has many sensors and the curved display is awesome I would defiantly recommend this to a friend and a couple of them are already jealous of it I am still finding out each day more that it can do So I have owned this phone a little over a month and Ive already been saved twice by the waterproof feature You dont know how awesome that is until you need it You can really tell that the camera is MUCH better than the S6 taking low light pictures is much easier with the S7 than any smartphone Ive ever used before My wife says the pictures look so crisp on the S7 even when the subject is moving I wouldve been a little more satisfied with a bigger screen I am extremely happy with my Samsung S7 I love it a lot its slick design and beautiful features such as a amazing camera and video When it comes to producing samsung is second to none the best everything is own is made by Samsung once aging great job on the phone nothing compares in fact the competitors cannot match samsung products 

Thanks I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge Its beautiful sleek and sexy I like the looks so much I found a case that is super thin and clear to show it off The pics it takes are amazing but I still cant figure out how to move downloaded pics to my gallery help The increased battery life is wonderful improvement too Now I can get through an entire day without having to be tethered to an outlet or sitting on the floor near an outlet of some busy airport My only complaint is actually quite small why cant Samsung come up with a bigger keyboard The enter key is almost invisible and my big thumbs keep hitting the period key instead of the space key Who was responsible Make him or her type on the factory installed keyboard all day Its torture Great design and features My only issue with this phone is the occasional issues with wifi not working There are a lot of things to like about this phone however the obvious attempt to make it inconvenient to toggle onoff my mobile data has overshadowed them all I have read many comments from others who are just as insulted and outraged by this tactic Really

Decent battery life Slick design although the very cool beveled display is proving to be problematic for screen protectors Plastic ones tend to peel away and tempered glasswell you dont bend glass

If not for the data onoff nonsense Id highly recommend this phone The S7 has so many unique features that make it so much better than the competition The water resistance is very cool Amazing speed and battery life Phone looks and operates amazingly I am so happy with this phone and would say it is by far the best camera video or music player too This phone is so awesome Very user friendly Fantastic battery life This is a great phone I like Android 6 Camera is better than previous phones Battery is amazing Favorite Galaxy so far and the best phone that I have owned 

No real major complaints Minor annoyance is that the edge is a little sensitive sometimes and so I scroll or other by mistake if not careful I avoid this much easier with a case Ive always loved Samsung products but this is better than I could have imagined Its easy to use sleek and the perfect size I love this phone I swapped from iPhones for the first time and I love it so much I love that I can customize almost everything unlike iphones I upgraded from an Galaxy S3 and the difference is night and day My battery can go all day on a single charge and the screen is super bright I love my phone I adore samsung products and have several However the hype of the S7 left me disappointed when I got it You took away the music player easy access to SD slot other than those 2 things there is no difference between S7 and my previous S5 The so called personalization is almost nonexistenthe just a sad few themes to pick from Same with the Gear Vr that was also hyped also left me disappointed All for the waterproof which Ive no desire to test Love the phone as a long term owner of the competition I can honestly say I made a great decision switching over Every feature I could ask for and some I havent ever thought of for example waterproofing Keep the innovation coming Samsung I love the fact it has 32 GB and I am able to use more apps I love having access to mail and other info as needed I love the size of the phone Love the feel Love the interface and the design Great photos Bought this phone after my last phone with a previous carrier took a swim and died Hadnt upgraded device in about two years and havent been with SamsungAndroid in about 4 years I am happy I made the switch back miss some of my windows phone features and have nothing bad to say about Windows but the play store has some more apps on board at the moment The Samsungandroid interface is great fast and very easy to use The phone is light battery lasts for a whole day with no problems I play games stream and surf makes calls and texts all day long with brightness on full setting Paired the gear s2 with the phone and enjoy both as a combo I would recommend this phone to anyone I have yet to test the water resistant feature but I dont think I will go out of my way to find out any time soon has great features and good product no problems with every fetures Love samsung phones The one problem that I have with the phone is that I use my phone to workout but have difficult playing music on it It often goes super crazy Brings up Google talk and opens apps on its own But only does it when I play music i like it taking very beautiful photos
also the edge are very convenient
also i can add a sd card for record video as well as photos
i am happy with it I purchased the S7 from Cricket after having looked at what it has to offer and the advantages over the S6 The screen is perfect for viewing anything the camera takes great pictures the battery lasts all day and overall its built to last The finishes on the phone make it look smart and professional and it weights just the right amount Samsung Pay is on it and comes in handy at store that are not equipped with NFC It is great phone for the price and with all new features its good deal Both rear and front cameras are great and gesture photo capture or voice commands for photo capture are great The edge does feels good however sometime it is little too much It is big screen phone and it has options for one hand opertation however that shrinks all the gadgets to smaller size it indeed is easy to operate however then it beats the purpose of having a bigger phone Sometimes operationg with one hand becomes little tedious as the back button is litlle bit far away from home button It has great sound for music playback little improvement needed for video playback as the vertical video playback is downside of the phone Great phone has nice speed and battery life The edge takes getting used to with fat hands I kept hitting it when emailing or texting Once I got a case it solved the issue Also its super slick since its glass on both sides Dropped it the 1st day I had it and broke the back and lost the great water proof feature about it once again a case is a must Love the edge screen for watching movies
 Download fast phone Easy function Very user friendly All my friends ask me about it all the time Couldnt be happier The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone When I first opened it I was amazed with the way it looked It was an easy setup to get the phone started and ready to go Since I bought the phone I was also amazed by the camera The super fast focus the camera has is beyond great especially when in need to take pictures in a hurry Not to mention the water resistant on the phoneThis has to be the best thing about the phone Overall the phone is superior and the best one I have ever had Awesome phone I love this phone The features are awesome It has a beautiful display Love this phone But then I love Samsung phones
Im impressed with the edge I like that it shows me what comes through with out having to pick the phone up Love it Had galaxys beforethis one lives up to its name Nice looking and great feel for a phone Phone has an exceptional picture This product has great features when something new pops up it give you an example which is a plus to me since Im Farley new at this The best thing is that you dont have to know a lot to use it Will by my mom one for mother day even have an display for older buyers Awesome phone overall the best phone I have owned Always been a Droid person  easy to navigate The edge bigger screen  better pictures love the edge bar Pros

Cons 
Over all not much different from S5 as looks go
Nonremovable battery I totally love this phone Im so happy I have it This phone replaced my s5 The s5 was also a great phone My only complaint so far is the screen when blank and I had to reboot the phone is safe mode It hasnt happened but the one time I love my new S7 edge I got my new phone as a replacement of my galaxy S5 Exceeded my expectations The picture quality is superb The battery lasts more than a day I love the new look and all the wonderful edge features On top of that Samsung has free classes with helpful nice and knowledgeable tech guys who go out of their way to make sure you know how to use the new features and phone I have always loved the Samsung products and now with the S7 Edge I am sold forever Now for accepting payment with Samsung Pay 2nd phone in 10 days issues with WiFi force the user to rely on mobile data Horrible to have this issue with what otherwise seems to be a good phone Most of my friends have iphones the reason is that they want something reliable the galaxy s7 edge Not as much Fingerprint scanner works 60 of the time home button is also kinda weird if you press the sides it wont register as a press you have to press more in the center I dont know if its only my unit or in general Other than that its truly an amazing device great battery life gorgeous screen button placement is perfect camera is the best in the market all in all its a pretty good and solid device I love this phone Its sleek easy to use and you can change the theme without downloading anything other than the themes themselves and I love that dearly One complaint I have however is that the screen sometimes randomly turns on for no reason that is annoying to me Other than that its great  I was concerned about it the size difference after the Note but this screen size is perfect Great features camera especially I upgraded from the HTC M8 and this phone loads apps quicker and has a better camera but the telephone reception is terrible and the battery drains very quickly The Samsung Galaxy s7 is overall a very good phone It has a fantastic 1440p display amazing 12 MP camera and fast snapdragon 820 chip But the phone by no means is without issues first off the battery life sucks It is a 3000 mah battery that should last me all day yet I find myself having to find a plug in at 4 PM moreover it runs Android 60 which has doze a feature that extends battery life while the screen is off That seems to be non existent here The speaker strait up is terrible Wish is had USB C The front facing camera is supposedly 5 MP but I cant tell with how grany it is as well as it has a bit of a fish bowl affect distorting the top 4 GB of RAM yet I find apps like Spotify or Pandora dropping out when I have more than 2 other apps open The fingerprint scanner never works on the first try Lastly touchwiz Samsung always has the top of the line everything except for the OS Touchwiz plain and simple sucks It is buggy very cartoony and runs very differently from pure Android It needs to be greatly fixed or it needs to be dropped and also put the back and resent app buttons on the correct side And one more small gripe When I hit the recent apps button and try to swipe away an app it almost never works on the first try sometimes takes me 3 or 4 Other than those few things it is a very good phone But next year please fix those things I made the switch from an iPhone to the Galaxy S7 and have nothing but great things to say about the phone Great features that really come in handy awesome design and functionality Would absolutely recommend this phone to a friend Everything you can expect from Samsung and more Definitely a better product than the competition This is the best smartphone you can get This includes all the features you ever dreamed The Samsung Galaxy s7 is an amazing phone From its performance down to its sleek design The gold platinum color makes the phone even more appealing Great battery love the always on display feature And youre able to make the phone your phone by adding themes of your choice Im so happy to see the return of the SD card  water resistant features I must say I am very impressed with Samsung Galaxy s7 smartphone Its hands down the BEST PHONE Ive ever owned I purchased the iphone 6s plus  it still didnt compare to the s7 so i decided to give the s7 a try  boy was i happy with the decision i made
The s7 take way better pictures holds a longer battery charge plus yu can charge it wireless I jumpEd in the pool with it and it still works like its brand new If youre looking for a ALL AROUND gd phone the Samsung Galaxy s7 smartphone is the way to go trust me you will not be disappointed Has a lot of potential Really great for gaming Very fast processor and graphics Camera takes amazing quality pictures Cant be beat by anything else out there Ive been a long time iPhone user and was intrigued by the Samsung phone I did a lot of research before taking the plunge Im very happy with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  great features super fast charging long battery life much more rugged than the iPhone Im still getting used to the Andriod operating system but Ill get there I find this to be a much more go to phone than my iPhone I have one for my work phone Samsung pay works much better than Apple Pay I also like that you can add memory on your own  unlike iPhone which is fixed with steep buy ups This is my 2nd S7 in a month The first one wouldnt connect to my home wifi network The replacement worked decently until about a week ago now not all of my text messages get sent out and starting yesterday Im missing calls and my voicemail wont accept messages Ive talked to AtT and they said Samsung pushed a new software update out causing the issues in the meantime my phone is unreliable and useless This phone is very sleek performs well has good battery life The camera features are great with many effects to choose from This is by far the best Samsung out of all the ones Ive had I have had almost all of the galaxy phones since tell original galaxy s captivate which I still have and use as my alarm clock The S7 is great  Looking forward to seeing what galaxy comes up with next When apps are connected to the Bluetooth more time then not I have to turn the bluetooth off the back on in order for it work Took my phone with me to myfirst bubble run Enjoyed being able to take pictures in the bubbles worry free after a mins of letting go Love the sleek design of my phone as well Camera is amaaazziinnnggg I appreciate several features of this phone The camera is wonderful despite the lower megapixel count I find I dont use the edge feature as much as I thought I would but I do appreciate having the full screen for viewing The display is bright and crisp even through the screen protector Overall Im extremely satisfied with the S7 Edge I very pleased I decided to upgrade very early despite the cost My primary reason for upgrading early in my contract was the expandable memory the Galaxy S7 has that the Galaxy S6 does not have I am very pleased with the featuresadvanced features the Galaxy S7 has compared to the S6 A more advanced camera system much more memory capability a battery that lasts longer clearer pictures and a more advanced system than the S6 The camera is very amazing and the videos look very good but the edge feature is also very good and the design is dope I love this phone Feels good in my hand features are so easy to use I have had the s3 and s6 but the s7 is so much better There is so much to this phone you really need to try it you will be amazed Great features  color and durability water proof  just a little problem that the screen goes black after someone stay playing for more than an hour The only problem with this phone is the poor battery life upgraded from the S4 mini and I am impressed with my S7 Absolutely love it and would recommend it Ive always had a Samsung and the 7 edge is the best ever The quality of sound pictures and everything else is by far better then anything out there Fantastic processor A little disappointed with the written instructions Have not checked for tutorials  Im sure they will help Love the fingerprint to unlock it I love my S7 Edge Better than any of my other Samsung phones The phone is not waterproof enough to get wet the way Lil Wayne pours champagne in the commercials I tried to pour champagne on my phone and the speaker became distorted I do not consider a phone that needs to be placed in rice after getting wet water resistantpretty sure thats just every phone Or maybe my champagne was too cheap I am loving my S7 Galaxy phone So glad I went back to my Samsung Love it love it I love my new S7 smartphone Perfect size and super fast My new Galaxy S7 is all I was hoping it would be Great camera picture and I use the memory slot for 200gb of memory What more could you want I love the way it hooks up and works with my Samsung smart tv I finally found my candy store Good job Samsung The Galaxy S6 continues the Galaxy legacy with style It runs Marshmallow without a hitch and the improved screen resolution helps VR look even better The device has a sleek professional appeal and fits nicely in one hand I have been extremely pleased with mine so far Great phone with worlds of features that all complement each other I have only had the Galaxy S7 edge for about a week but I can say that it continues to surpass my expectations I have a number of Samsung products from a tablet a smart TV and now this phone I have always loved Samsung items for their excellent pictures Now I am finding out how good the rest of the technology is I knew this phone did a lot of things when I bought it but I keep finding new things that it does every day as I learn how to use it to its fullest The display the camera the processors and just everything about it screams top of the line I must say that I was already a Samsung fan before I purchased this phone but if I wasnt I would be now The Samsung S7 Egde is a really good phone It is very fast in everything I do with it I really enjoy the phone My battery life is really good on most things but where I work it drains the battery down really fast This is due to the building I am in because I work for a hospital and there are lots of interference that might be related to my battery drain At home the battery life is great I recently upgraded to the s7 from a RazorM Yes it was a huge upgrade Ive read all of the complaints from other users but I have not experienced any of them The phone is working great The battery life is lasting for days the network and wifi connections have been continuous Granted Im not glued to my phone like most folks which might be why my battery lasts so much longer but my old phone would die just sitting on my desk So this is a big improvement It also charges super fast I think this phone has a nice design and feel in your hands 
The screen size perfect for me as I like a large screen but I want to carry it in my shirt pocket The glass at the edges had a slight bevel giving it a very refined look I love that its water proof and has an sdcard It has an incredible camera When I first received this phone I took a couple of selfies and I was Impressed by the depth and richness of the imageI took an outdoor picture It was lit by street lights on a dark evening I looked at the image on screen and I was amazed at the level of detail I snapped the picture still not expecting much but the image had captured all the details on screen and more It is the best nighttime photo I have ever taken The phone is quick with plenty of memory The battery life is definitely a step up and I dont feel tethered to outlets and chargers This is the best smart phone I have ever used I love this phone I will not list every feature but it has it all and everything is top quality I chose it over the IPhone and enjoying it every miute I just purchased my phone yesturday This is my first smart phone and I was surprised how easy it was to use I did not want to give up my flip phone but my wife made me and I am glad she did The phone has been great so far The only complaint I have is that I accidentally hit keys on the side of the screen when Im reaching across the phone The picture quality is great sound quality is ok its very responsive and feels great in my hands I have the clear view case for it which I love because you can answer calls without opening the case Is not a bad smartphone Good phone overall but over price Been using this phone for a little over a month and really happy with it new features are a lot of fun to use Bit expensive but didnt expect anything else for a new release There is a lot to like about this phone The waterproof feature is fantastic and I am really thrilled about the inclusion of an SD card Still wishing for replaceable batteries 

Really unhappy that adoptable storage was disabled I cannot understand the reason for that

Overall the best phone by Samsung so far I originally had the S3 for about 4 years and was fine with that but I cracked my screen so I figured I would upgrade and got the S7 edge and so far have nothing but good things to say Phone looks cool its super fast and the battery easily lasts all day get one I love many of the features of this phone There are only a couple things that I would change but overall great phone I bought this phone a month ago and LOVE IT better camera excellent screen fast water resistance and more LOVE IT One of the best phones that Ive ownedpicture is cleargreat cameraIm not afraid to use in the rain or at the pool I highly recommend this phone to everyone You wont be disappointed  I love the slender design and the great speed it has The storage and memory are outstanding The battery charges in less than half the time of my old S4 Still learning all of its great capabilities I recommend it to everyone I like the most of the new features and the improvments made to old ones It preforms well besides a short lad spike every now and the or an app shutting down completetly The phone itself is good I wish it was a little thicker though The S7 is similar to an iPhone 6 but I can still easily distinguish the two Overall I like what was done and congratulate you guys on your success Im a truck driver and the voice commands are so nice on this phone Ive owned many Galaxy phones and this one didnt disappoint I have had this phone for almost 2 months and I absolutely love it I really liked my S5 but the S7 is much faster more responsive and seemingly more durable I highly recommend this phone My only really complaint about this phone is the fingerprint reader Its really frustrating to have a flagship device but I have to place my finger on the reader three or more times to unlock the device I dont care for the glass back because thats just another post of the device I have to worry about breaking Samsung never disappoints  This phone is lightening fast it takes AMAZING pictures and the pictures in low light conditions are out of this world  Im a Samsung fan for life  I also love the speaker on the end of the phone instead of the back A great product I love the display and colorsWell made and an outstanding product I own Samsung TVs  a Samsung refrigerator  two Samsung phonesThe Samsung VR is so realistic its addictive Ive had many phones The S7 Edge has been my favorite with many features Design screen excellent camera and battery strength Ive recommended this phone to many friends who are also enjoying the S7 edge as well excelent unit performance i love my new Samsung S7 I like the life of the battery and that it will take a 200GB SD card to hold my job site plans The dbl tap button for the camera makes it so I dont miss a shot The speed of the phone is incredibly awesome I like that it has more settings for privacy With all this it cost the same as my S5 did two years ago Cant beat this one so go get you one and you will not be disappointed at all Everything from the huge amount of space for my music and photos on the phone itself it us even more impressive that I can add an SDcard up to 200G I love everything about this phone the size the features everything 
I only have one complaint and that is how slippery the phone itself is
If I put the phone on any other surface that isnt perfectly flat it slides off 
But other than that I love the phone Samsung has really outdid themselves with this news S7 Edge phone larger screen bigger battery waterproof they even brought back the extended memory card  superb camera watching videos and movies on this phone and looking at pictures its ever so clear  You dont own one of these phones you need to get one soon so you can see it for yourself Just cant go wrong with the Galaxy Love the fact it went back to the old connection The quick charge is great no hassles Love the fingerprint ID for quick access Havent had any problems loading programs i used on past Galaxy phones with compatibility only complaint is the phone book I preferred the old Galaxy 6 version I love this phone the features it have with the camera you can take a 3D shot or you can record 4 different modes onto one pic I love my phone Takes great pictures I havent seen all it can do yet and not sure if I will ever use all of them But I am a Samsung girl all the way Love the size and feel Did get a little hot at first but seems fine now I love almost everything about my phone Its not very user friendly but Im sure Ill figure it out soon Holds more appsfastlove night camerathank goodness for water resistant Fast and easy to learn Im in my 50s and a slow learner on this new technology 
This phone was know problem for me and very fast even removing sensitive when graving from any way keeps activating features or apps that I do not intent to I love this phone The only thing that I would want to change is some of the built in apps I dont use It would be nice to be able to uninstall some of these apps or not have them at all But there is no way to really get them off the phone Other then that I think the phone it self is great Overall the device is phenomenal and the cases are great However weve had a lot of trouble finding screen protectors that work with the curve The device freezes a little bit on Minecraft and totally froze up once shortly after processing but everything since has been a dream machine I really love the phone and it features The only thing that I wish was better is battery life Fingerprint unlock and using fingerprint for Samsung pay as well as many other apps is an awesome improvement over s6 Always on display is also a great new addition Had the Galaxy 5upgraded to Galaxy 7 Love new features easy to worklearn Glad I upgraded First off take this review with a grain of salt My prior phone was an S4 switching to the S7 opened up a lot more performance and features that I wish I would have had two years ago The only thing that I wish was better was the battery life I can definitely get almost 3 days brand new but I have this feeling that after a good six months of use the battey will be two days with power saver My favorite features is the multitasking split window the ability to use Microsoft Office and its Google Sync features All in all it is a nice phone although there are a few glitches here and there and extremely pricey for the average person Primarily used for work outlook Salesforce et al work seamlessly photo quality is incredible love the business card scanner built in to the contacts Love the smooth design and the ability to add memory Best feature of any phone that I have had in the past i recommend this phone to everyboby 5 star friendly use Love the fact that I can add memory Very few smartphones will allow that I love everything about this phone Its very easy to use Very lightweight also I love my new galaxy s7 Its has a very fast response Pictures are great Nice to hold in your hand and its a beautiful phone Cons
Fingerprint sensor is slow and sometimes doesnt recognize saved fingerprints When selecting links on screen it often zooms in the selected text instead of proceeding to the link For one handed phone operations in particular right handed a protective case is required due to the screen edge impeding other functions because it already feels your palm I havent found a screen protector suitable for the curved screen 
Pros
Camera picture quality is really good compared to that of the iphone Screen size is excellent compared to the overall size of the phone I now see why my sister is so excited about this phone 
It was time to upgrade Old phone was the Galaxy Mega I took her recommendation 
The speed camera and video resolution and battery life are outstanding especially compared to my old phone
I compared the S7 edge to other phones The S7 edge was easier to operate
Some people are concerned about protecting the glass screen I chose the new SView Folio cover I dont even worry about putting my phone in my pocket because the phones glass is covered Also I purchased the wireless charger I never have to take my phone out of the cover The phone charges so fast
This phone is truly amazing Im coming from a Galaxy s4 so seeing how its grown up is wonderful Navigation is easier double click for a photo picture quality is unmatchednavigation is super easy and the battery life is double what I had Moving info from one phone to the next was truly seamless Im a Galaxy Girl I upgraded from an S5 It was a flawless transition The apps it came with ATT are useful The battery holds up well The camera is phenomenal This is a unique product Samsung keeps producing better the features are awesome its slimthe colors especially the gold is beautifulthe camera is super bright and sharp you need to use it to know It was worth the price the camera is great and the voice quality is so clear I also love that the screen is waterproof The other day I accidently splashed water on my phone and almost had a heart attack but then I remembered how reliable and safe my phone was Thank you It has been awesome having it Everything works great and I havent had any trouble with it Was kind of leery to step up from a Samsung Galaxy S4 but I am overly impressed with the performance of the Galaxy S7 Edge Powerful can handle just about anything I need to do
Love the SD card option
Edge feature is cool but I dont use it much
Miss the IR blaster of my Note 3 I consider the Peel Smart Remote a killer app for a phone

I think the s7 with the addition of the IR blaster could be the perfect phone I was always an iPhone user and this S7 Edge has blown away the thought of ever going back The camera is simply amazing no flash needed in dark areas nightclub And the sleek design is very convenient also Although I want to try out the water resistant feature but afraid to loose the phone But went from the note 4 and loving it Thank you Samsung I love all the features and shortcuts The edge makes the apps and people I use most easily accessible Not to mention the camera takes the best pictures of any phone Ive seen to date I cant say enough great things about this phone I feel like its made my life easier I love this phone It has an amazing design and amazing features Great screen long battery life EXCELLENT camera and some great features A great improvement from my previous phone I love the phone so far its beautiful runs great fast battery last a long time My last Samsung a Notebook 4 was exactly the same but after 4 months it went hay wire I got a replacement same result so we will see
 If this one goes off the rails it will be my last Samsung I love it looks good I like the curved screen and the water recistance I got my new phone about a month ago and I absolutely love it It is very user friendly I am a real estate agent and I can do anything I need to on the go I would definitely recommend this to anybody that is considering purchasing it I love this phone I started years ago with a Samsung Galaxy 3 then got the Samsung Galaxy 5 when it first came out and now I have the 7 and it is everything I thought it would be and more I am able to do everything I would on my tablet on my cell and more I use this as a personal phone and a business phone The phone is amazing The only bad thing about it is that the actual phone is very slick you need to put a case on it so it doesnt slide all around Amazing device Love the different camera functions smooth app loading and fast startup Battery life is amazing This is the best phone  Beautiful pics easy video sending as a text trim to fit I love this phone and the fast charge is amazing  I cant wait for the 8 to come out Ill be getting that one to  This is a very nice phone love the edge to edge screen Is much faster than my previous phone the note 4 also very nice that it is water proof I bought this phone for my wife who is technology challenged She fell in love almost immediately and loves to use it She is especially impressed with the camera and has fantastic results with the finished product
I also was impressed enough to go buy the same phone the next week so fal not disappointed The s7 edge wow its an amazing gadget its worth every penny Samsung did a wonderful job with this one cant complain Good features a nice change from the IPhone in most respects Excelent Phone I love this samsung
The battery is durable
TheThe display is very brigth It is so great to see the return of waterproofing and removable storage all in a sleek design As I have been a Samsung user from the past 3 years I must say that the galaxy s7 edge is the best smart phone I have used so far Its design is just flawless and the features are amazing Its battery life can easily last a day The feature that I like the the most is the one handed operation I can simply hold the phone in one hand and type easily without even using my outher hand I would totally recommend this product The new Galaxy S7 edge has been a breeze to learn and the edge features add a coolness to it The curve of the screen was strange at first but I have gotten used to it The speaker is kinda whiney with music I have had other products but this phone is best had so far The S7 is perfect I have no complaints I had the a new phone because I could upgrade and only had it a month when the S7 came out I had to get The S7 It is the best phone I would recommend it to everyone Ive had lots of phones before in my life This one is one of the best that Ive ever had It is beautiful and has great features I recommend it highly Got the new galaxy and its amazing fast Its the best phone Ive ever had Love this phone to death this phone is very customizable One word to describe this phone Amazing The lag from the 6 is gone I love it The new battery also makes it a must have I go a good 14 hours on a overnight charge and I use it lots for apps games and stuff so for its battery life to handle me Im impressed the phone is amazing compared to my iphone there are so many different functions that a simple iphone does not have Pros
Snappy and responsive with no lag
Best Version of Touch Whiz yet
Best looking smartphone ever made
Feels great in the hand fun to use

Cons
Nothing important enough to mention I am really enjoying this phone It has lots of features Go out and look at them if u have not yet So much better use of the larger screen than my iphone No more reading glasses for me I limped my Galaxy s4 along for months waiting for the s7 to come out I was disappointed when th s6 came out without the SD slot I prefer to have all my photos and music in the SD card instead of the phone so held out for the s7 hoping they would add the SD slot back and was happy to see that they had 
I have 2 Galaxy tablets and this is my second Galaxy phone I dont understand why so many people are obsessed with products from the company named after a fruit from the Garden of Eden My husband has that companys phone and I hate it Everyone says they are easier but I sure dont see that to be the case 
I love my new s7 The slim design is easy to handle the touch is very responsive and the screen is crystal clear Battery does not hold the charge as well as I had hoped but is fine for me I dont talk on it a lot so it will last all day I just charge it overnight 
One thing that I miss from the s4 is the ability to hit the volume buttons when in text messaging to change the size of the font on text messages Maybe I just havent found the setting to allow that 
Overall I am very happy with my s7 and definitely recommend it I think I have my husband talked into replacing his eye phone with the Galaxy s7  This phonemail is amazing Nothing compares to the high quality of thiservice phone The camera is by far the best on the market It is super fast and easy to use It is light weight and thin The display is incredibly beautiful This phone is by far the best so far fast easy to use and has style I like the color weight and overall look of this phone The battery is much better than anything I have had before I like this one better than s7 its a little bigger than and smaller than s6edge Nice upgrade from my last phone nice amout of space
Only problem with it is the back is made of the glass material used on the front and Im clumsy so theres cracks in it already
Get a case if youre clumsy I have to say that I am very happy to exchange my iPhone 6 to the S7 The S7 has so many features I enjoy it The phone is very capable fast processing and beautiful look

The S7 was the perfect choice for me as it operates an android OS and it gives so much more advantages to the user

Way to go SamsungLOVE MY S7
Luiz I accidentally didnt plug in my phone that night before I went to bed I woke up the next day with my phone being at 20 after being turned on with use for 28 hours Then i plugged it in and within the hour it was at 100 again Absolutely love the speed battery life lack of heat everything except one small thing The vibrating feature is so much improved that the phone walks off the table during the vibration phase We had to add sticky strips to the back of the phone to stop the walking Easy fix but my sleek gold phone is marred by sticky dollar store fake jewels to prevent the phone from walking off a table onto the floor Still I would highly recommend this phone just stay with silver color as that is the sticky jewel color This phone has great performance the edge feature is more useful than I thought very lightweight and can use this phone with ease with one hand I really love my Samsung Galaxy but the problem is that it does not come with the memory card slot so it does make the galaxy slower faster as the cellphones memory getserves full if this cell oh one wouldve had this feature it would be the perfect phone overall I always recommend galaxys and that one is the best galaxy I ever had love it Love itso many cool features Great phone very pleased except that just like the S5 people have a hard time hearing me and for no reason the call drops and then comes back That is annoying No matter what better than the iPhone Instantly liked the phone after I activated it Keeps a charge well even with the number of apps I needed to install Looks sleek Given that it is not the cheapest phone on the market I would advise purchasing a case to protect it I am amazed at the products that Samsung creates  everything form their phones to their smart watches I have owned several different brands of phones and in my opinion there is nothing that keeps my attention like my Galaxy s6 edge plus and my Galaxy S7 
I cannot believe how beautiful the screen is  everything is just do vibrant looks like the pictures jump right off the screen The speed of the device is second to none I have had no drag or I guess studder that I have noticed I love the integration of Google and the backup of pictures my family pictures mean everything and Samsung just Rocks out taking movies and pictures
I like to share my pictures and Samsung has made that such an easy task
The size of the phone fits perfectly and is really comfortable 
The S7 is just a remarkable fun piece of future technology that is available today

Thank you for these devices please keep up the Awesome work and designs You have a customer for life with me So far loving it It is so easy to personalize for your needs and likes It seems every day I find new better features This has great battery life All other features are great like the s6 Features are great Color quality is awesome Overall rating is excellent Bad part is the screen so sensitive it will get you all over the place when you using without a case Screen glass can break easily I love Samsung products This is the third Samsung phone Ive had and it is a beast I love it I have other Samsung products and will continue to own Samsung products Thanks for another great product Samsung SamsungForLife This phone is light weight easy to use and has excellent performance Simply amazing in every way Other phones want to be this phone The design is simple yet stunning The edge is very easy to use All the features are amazing and all the apps open immediately The only thing is that there isnt a default music app Other than that it is amazing The galaxy s7 edge is a beautiful phone with great features Upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the S7 glad I skipped the S6 Impressed with the new capabilities really like the screen and glass Also glad it kept most of the features I liked from the S5 and improved on them

I wasnt aware until I had already bought it that it no longer has the IR capability Bad decision on Samsungs part should never loose capability If you are looking for a phone that is more than just an ordinary phone than the Samsung Galaxy S7 is for you It is user friendly has great features and looks good Not only does it have great calling and texting features but it also has an extremely awesome camera I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 If you are thinking about getting a new smartphone think smart Think Galaxy S7 The MAJOR issue with this phone is the battery This was supposedly an upgrade from my previous phonebut turned out the battery was a downgrade I have to charge it numerous times throughout the day even though on music or anything is playing I put it in battery saving mode and it still drains pretty quickly That is really the only issue I have Carry a charger at all times or you will be with a dead phone The volume could definately be louder as well This phone is lightweight easy to use and looks great The camera is great and I am glad that Samsung has emojis now I was feeling left out in comparison to a certain other big name phone maker but now I feel like my phone is the better product Samsung Milk is an awesome music player as well Tнιѕ pнone ιѕ ѕleeĸ powerғυl and ғιтѕ ιn yoυr нand perғecтly I traded my iPhone in for the Galaxy 7 a week ago To me this is much easier to use and has more  better features I love it The Galaxy S7 is a great operating phone The transition from my S5 Active was seamless Honestly ive owned Galaxy S series phones since the S3 I absolutely love this phone I work in power plants cleaning the condensor units with water Ive ruined other phones before because of water damage But i can play my music on the amazing sounding speaker and keep the phone in the water box with me If it falls in the water i pick it up and it continues working Also this phone has the longest lasting battery ive ever seen Cosmetically this phone is very good looking and structurally this phone is very well built I have recommended this phone to everyone i knowand i will continue to do so Ive even talked many people into converting to this phone This is the best phone ive ever owned Once you go Galaxy S series youll never go back There isnt anything I could write about this phone Its a Galaxy same as years past plus the return of the SD card slot and water proofing Main selling point for me was the water proofing However this is just like any galaxy or android for that matter Same OS you have used and will be slow in 6 months to a year due to use Camera isnt amazing nor is the phone itself Lackluster but usable Good phone sure but its the same with most others Great top of the line phone I love the fingerprint scanning ability the responsiveness resistance to water and dust and the camera is just awesome

However all of the awesome does come with a steep price tag I absolutely love this phone It has literally everything I want in a phone and then some Its fast has a beautiful picture and the processing power is truly something to behold Wow I just upgraded from my S4 to a S7 Edge I love this phone The battery power lasts longer than any phone I have had in the past The ultrapower saving mode and the fact it closes out apps running in the background that have not been used in a few daysgreat The camera is leaps and bounds better than previous and seems better than any other phone on the market Keep the great updates coming A feature packed sleek looking phone This is a very awesome phone but does have a few downfalls 

Pros A ton of features
Incredible camera
Big battery
Not too big or small
Great resolution
Water and dust proof

Cons Still has some lag
Cant make the sd card part of the system non adoptable storage


Basically I love everything about this phone except a couple things One is the non adoptable storage come on Samsung you give us room to add 200 gigs but no adoptable storage Thats just wrong and just a tease
Also we still cant get away from the Android lag Even though the internal specs of this phone are incredible it still seems to lag once you load it up with apps 
And finally and one thats super annoying is sometimes it doesnt load what I actually clicked on Etc Ill be in my text Ill click on James to text him and it loads Tina Or Ill be in snap chat click on Ashley and itll go to Nathan That could be a BIG problem I have had the phone for a few weeks and I love it It took some getting used tomy previous phone was an S3but even that was doable Its pricey but I think it is worth it for the sophistication storage and speed This is my 4th Samsung phone I have 3 phones and a galaxy tab pro I love that I can use all of them with all my info shared between them I have been happy with the performance of all my Samsung devices the best smartphone I have ever owned Great performance and features Love this phone S health is awesome Great picture quality I love the 7S Edge It feels good in your hand Not at all boxy feeling in your hand I didnt think the edge part of the phone would be a big deal But I use it all the time very great idea from Samsung I will be a forever Samsung customer for everything Keep up the good work This phone has exceeded all of my expectations Its performance is fast I have had phones in the past that claimed this but this phone does it for me Have had my Samsung Galaxy S7 for over 1 month now and really like it Really happy with the fact that it is waterproof because I accidentally had to test my old S5 with that feature and it worked great Havent had any problems with this S7 It does everything that it is supposed to do Its everything the galaxy s6 was and more Love the design and features Being able to take Seflies in low light I feel like the edged screen gets in the way more than it is beneficial Certain webpages its hard to select things you want to open or delete  I was never too fond of samsung but I went and bought this one and I fell in love I love the camera how long the battery last the processer is amazing I even converted some of my iPhone friends into Samsung owners The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is incredible I was not a fan with the direction they were heading in following last years release of the s6 s6 edge s6 edge  and note 5 However this phone brings a smoother experience enhanced theme store and apps back to the edge screen Also back are memory card and water resistance Love the new color options too The black is black and the gold is gold Silver is very sweet The Galaxy S7 is the best phone I have owned to date Super fast performance and terrific battery life And as with all Samsung phones the screen is gorgeous The only thing I wished was changed is the all glass design But that is personal preference Overall a wonderful phone Im really disappointed with the battery life on this phone I traded a Note 4 for the S7  wish I had just kept the Note 4 I dont see anything special about the S7  I had the S5 a few years ago  nothing has really changed I wish I had just upgraded to a Note 5 Samsung did it again it is beautiful phone just love everything about this phone I have had this for about 2 weeks and it seems like i have had to reset it everyday apps dont work as well as they did on my note 4 Kinda wish i hadnt switched The camera is fantastic But calls seem to be less clear The 4g doesnt seem to be as reliable on this phone Bought for my bday to replace 4yr old Motorolano comparison Easy to use beautiful design I love it This phone has everything I need I switched from a Note 3 and the size feels great and comfortable 
The OS is wonderful
The battery life is so much better than my note 3
The camera is also far superior to what I had before The pictures come out very clear and the camera has a much wider range Very true to color I love how this phone feels in my hand  The screen size is bot too big not too small Its fast andhandles everythung i need  i like that there is a mem card slot for extra memory although putting the microsd card is a little scary because I feel like the slot it goes into could easily break or the mem card could fall out when inserting I love the quick camera button its really handy and swipe palm to screenshot feature is fast and easy I also like how quickly I can take photos Unfortunately Ive encountered a problem where the power button and volume button completely freeze and become inoperable I dont know why this happens and its inconvenient but it fixes itself with a restart Also no glass screen protectors can fit this screen because the screen is slightly curved on the sides so every glass protector will either not cover the screen completely or will cover it but have a really bad halo and wont sit flat on the screen 
I love the fast charging feature my phone really charges in no time  However with my use i dont actually think that my phone lasts as long as advertised Its not much of a problem though as it charges quickly  overall a great phone  Does not work with the Samsung Fonts Note 4 speakers are better The S7 Galaxy Edge has great style easy to use features Nice slim phone and great to use but sometimes I have connectivity issuesnot enough to waste the time to call the phone company It might even be the service provider and not the phone but ive never had the issue on previous models I would still recommend the phone because its the best version so far truly Ive had the s5 my bf had the s6 and I got the new s7 which I love I looked up many reviews of this phone before I bought it and all of them said this was an amazing phone I love all the features that come with it and the display is so good So after all the reviews I got one myself All those reviews where right I love this phone and its the best phone I have ever had I can honestly say that it earned 5 stars This phone has been a great product from the day I got it This phone has been one of the best I have seen in a very long time The design is premium and catches the eye of others due to the shine and luxurious tone The camera is by far the best on the market The very fist picture that I took really sold me on the phone and many of my other friends It has a really great high definition camera and works amazing in low light settings Overall this phone has been great and has not let me down At times the edge screen can be sensitive to your palm when you are holding it which can be bothersome at times But overall everything else about the phone will leave others envious By the way the singe charge on this phone will allow you about 24 hours of full functionality I am loving this phone more than any other phone Ive had My previous phone was nothe that bad but that phone is no where in comparison I am constantly learning new features with this device and it is an awesome piece of technology I WOULD  HAVE highly recommended this phone to other friends and family I have yet to test out the waterproof aspect but in due time I will be taking photos in the pool Nice design and much better battery life than s5

Very nice phone My only problem with my phone though I think this problem is universal is that when my phone thinks it knows what word Im trying to type it comes up with the most obscure words instead of common every day words And if you type a word and it comes up with another word it does not give you the most common word that is similar to it as an option causing you to have to manually type it in Most often I type and and my phone brings up abs but doesnt give and as an option Just comes up as Judy etc I think more work could be done in this department Other than that I love my phone The camera is freaking awesome And I love that it is water proof I love the speed of this phone it goes back and forth between apps and web pages in no time flat very easy navigation the built in speakers have awesome sound doesnt sound like phone speakers sounds like you have speakers hooked up to it and the camera is unbelievable the pictures I take no matter the light look great I have only 2 complaints about this phone it goes through its battery pretty fast and the touch screen super sensitive Absolutely love it I do wish it had the moving photo option like the I Phone The battery life of this phone leaves a lot to be desired I have tried turning off just about every feature that made me want to get it just to save the battery with no luck My battery last about 46 hours before needing recharged Quality products and good equipmentthis generations best I really like this phone so far only had it a few weeks just continues to improve on previous versions of the Galaxy phone line up I love my S7 edge The edge is a cool feature that allows quick access to my most used apps The camera features are excellent on this phone The pictures are sharp and clear When i want to listen to music i plug in my earphone and boom it turns on and the selfie feature you just say cheese and it takes the photo Stop adding apps I wont use and cant Uninstall And there were changes made with licensing that wont allow me to download pictures and music with one of my favorite apps Other than that I have been a fan of Samsung Galaxy products since my first one When Samsung abandoned the replaceable battery and SD Card after the Note Edge I was disappointed and went to a competitor for my next phone While that phones performance was ok I missed many of the features that make Samsung great The OLED display the Edge screen the superb camera results the Water Resistance and the built in wireless fast charging along with the many other features that Samsung only can deliver

After the Galaxy S7Edge was released I became more intrigued with thoughts of going back to Samsung but was hesitant to go to a phone with a builtin battery as I like to be able to switch and get back to 100 quickly My frustrations with the not so good brand phone grew and I decided to go back to Samsung

I feel like the Prodigal Son It is good to be home The battery life is phenomenalaveraging over 1 day 12 hours on a single charge The wireless fast charging is so great and really fast too 
Also The Edge features have gotten better than S6E bringing some of the Edge Panels from the original Note Edge back and the design is just phenomenal The phone does not feel as big as it is and the display and camera are the best available anywhere today on a smartphone

If you are thinking of the S7Edge for your next phone dont hesitatetry it out at your dealer or just do what I did and buy it from your carrier This is the best phone I ever owned and the best in a long line of Samsung phones I have previously owned Recently upgraded from a S4 and I am very pleased with the S7 Everything about it is refined and feels fresh Very snappy device Well done Samsung Beautiful phonecant get enough of the phone best Samsung phone ever the feel in your hand so premium well built qualityone of the best s7 ever made go for it you wont be disappointed I purchased this to replace my failing S5 and I have been nothing but happy with it The phone is of a very nice build quality and it runs very smoothly It is an improvement in every way on Samsungs previous phones

There was much hype about some if its exclusive features Here is my experience with them

Alwayson display is actually much more useful than I would have anticipated It uses very little battery and is great to be able to see the time and important notifications while the phone is sitting on a desk

The camera is said to be very high quality Admittedly I have not used it much to take photos however I can say that it is able to focus on things at a very close distance something the S5 struggled with and something that makes this phone very nice for taking pictures of a sheet of paper or something in order to remember it later

The edge display is something I thought Id like more As it stands it suffers by being too Samsungoriented The ecosystem of Samsung apps is an honestly silly idea because while the edge can give me shortcuts to my text messaging app it only works properly when Im using the default Samsung messaging app Something like Facebook Messenger for examplewhich I use often for group chats with friendshas absolutely no integration into it Other calendars cant be used for the edge display either and the biggest flaw is that developers on the Play Store cannot design edge apps for the phone I love my Samsung products and this is not a disappointment I was hesitant about the non removable battery but so far it has not been an issue This phone is easy to use Samsung is always great Who doesnt want a S7 Its water proof and highly recommended Because if you are like me my phone is always near water and have fell in water a few times This phone makes life so much easier Get your self one is you havent already Ive had a new Samsung phone every year since the S3 came out Ive felt that they have typically gotten better every year but even though I enjoyed my s6 it was definitely lacking Ive had my s7 for over a month now and it is almost perfect My main complaints with the s6 were battery life no waterproofing and no SD card You add all those to the s7 plus no flap you have to plug and unplug and an amazing camera and better battery life than I was expecting and you have an exceptional phone I always had Samsung and I think the design and the features of this model is the best compared to the others The camera is fast with high quality Samsung pay is amazing you should definitely give it a chance I liked the phone at first but I noticed some battery issues I would plug it in at night and in the morning sometimes it would be less that 80 percent charged The case always felt warm to me if not hot The final straw was I was at a conference from 7am to 1130am battery drained completely Plugged in my spare portable chargerbattery from which I can get 3 full charges or could on my former G2 By 5pm my external battery pack was empty and my phone was off I had to drive for 40 minutes with the phone plugged into the USB port of the car before the phone would even turn on I depend upon my phone and cannot be without it which is why when the carrier replaced it under warranty I chose a competitors phone I just could not risk being without a phone for any period of time I wish it had worked for all the features that made me buy it in the first place This phone is something else I absolutely love it The ease of of the features are outstanding the look and feel of amazing I recommend this phone to everyone if you are an iPhone user switch now you wont regret it I never plan to get a new phone I had a Note 3 since it released and switched from an iPhone It was the best thing Ive ever done The galaxy performance designs performance and over all ease of use is so much greater Then I got the S7 after my Note randomly broke when in the cold 

The performance upgrade was extremely noticeable right out of the box As soon as it turned on the screen display was immaculate I never had anything with this good of a picture everything just looked extremely clear and realistic I absolutely love the waterproofing of the phone I work around machinery all day and I dont need to worry about any moisture really damaging the phone if its a small amount 
Only two things I was not a fan of is it being so lightweight which is nice but at the same time I feel like it may be fragile which is easily fixed with a nice quality case and theres plenty of them fairly priced 
The second was the price its not overly expensive but I feel like it was still pretty high 
Overall its a perfect phone and Id highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new phone Speechless is all can say everything it does is perfection Samsung has brought it all and then some with there top of the line technology and speed and its all wrapped up in this compact sexy new design its a powerhouse thank you Samsung for 110 when it comes to your products and A1 Outstanding customer service and recognition Sincerely Extremely Proud Owner of the All New Samsung Galaxy S7 Daniel I love this phone Had the galaxy s4  was so excited to get to upgrade to the s7 I bought 2 weeks ago Usually takes a few days to learn It was just like picking up my Galaxy s6 No problem Pretty good specs and nifty features Too smooth though and too large for one hand operations This is the best Galaxy that Samsung has ever made I had the S6 edge and it is a better phone It doesnt have the overheating issues and the poor battery life that the S6 has Samsung you outdid yourselves this time GalaxyS7edge Havent had alot of time with s7 yet but great upgrade over s3 which it replaced Great phone awesome battery sleek and durable Always on feature is so convenient By far best phone I have ever had I love it  It works great and its fast so far dont have any issues with it Coming from Galaxy S6 the Galaxy S7 is amazing
With the new design features and quality product from Samsung you will absolutely LOVE this device Camera is fantastic and high quality we have always received from Samsung You must try this device Its my favorite so far I tried the Samsung Galaxy S7Edge and its an amazing product as well Thank you Samsung for all your high quality products you create and make for us we love My upgrade has been long due my S4 had became a sorry excuse for a smartphone with the battery lasting less than an hour I didnt get the S6 because of the lack of a MicroSD expansion slot Finally when this released I was glad to see they added waterproofing and MicroSD alongside with the same design staying and even more durable than last years The performance on this is amazing If you dont play many graphic intensive games you wont see much reason for it but all I have to say is Wow its almost too much with games running on high at 1440p at solid frames The battery too is excellent and the addition of fast charging I was glad to see as well for when you are in a hurry when you forget to charge it The battery seems to drain very slowly while playing games too something my S4 had problems with Remembering when the S4 had its bulky slow almost Windows 95esque Touchwiz Interface The software doesnt try to be revolutionary on this which to the matter of fact it isnt And thats the way it should be on a phone no frills just the basics The themes game manager and other preinstalled apps are actually useful unlike the billions of preinstalled apps on the S4 Amazon Apps Cough Cough Waterproofing is good but Ive yet to have a chance to see it in action One downside adoptable storage which I would really like to see since I have a 128Gb MicroSD card The design on the phone is amazing though in a since it is last years design which was also beautiful There are some minor changes smaller camera bump and the phone is thicker allowing for a bigger battery Thanks for not pulling a classic Appleism The edges of the phone have been curved for better grip though it still slides around By the way the water cooling is actually just a heatpipe The camera takes crisp beautiful photos aside from the lower megapixel count than the S6 but if youre not that much of a photographer youll barely notice it The sound is good and the Inbuilt EQ is amazing The loudspeaker is actually loud now Lat but not least and the only place where this sexy beast falls short VALUE And Im not talking about the regular one Which is also pretty pricey But the edge 100 more for a silly gimmick and the glass and display shouldnt even cost that much to make even if it is custom made But all in all this is probably the best Samsung phone so far They finally listened to everybody prayers And rants And got it right this time Way to go I have had the Samsung s4s5 s6 and the Note 5 and I have to say the s7 is by far the best phone Samsung has released yet It has a beautiful display the battery life is excellent and it has a lightning fast processor 

I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new phone Really love the phone Easy to use great features Simplified design and operation make using it easy for any user whether beginner or expert Will continue to use samsung galaxy series from years to come Upgraded from note 3 and this phone is amazing Picture taking is great the processor is great Everything is so much faster and easy Had the S5 previously and didnt think that this would be that much of an upgrade Boy was I wrong The display is beautiful and it takes wonderful picture I love the edge screen This is a very awesome phone Everything from it is cool and it is great Samsung amkes the best phones and this time they did it again This is the best brand out there for any electronics mostly for phones Keep it up Samsung you guys Rock Great display and design with the curved displayedge Very elegant Powerful Good battery life Water resistant feature This is a great smart phone I love the 3600 mah Battery lasts all days Finally you can have a phone with near edge to edge screen and it is water resistant to boot You have the Samsung apps your used to great looking screen great edge features make your most used apps easily available Very glad I bought the galaxy s7 edge is a great looking smooth running powerful phone performance is great the screen is great the biggest things that stand out are the slick surface this phone is very easy to lose grip of the shape does make it fit your hand better the speaker at bottom by port makes it a lot easier to hear finding a good screen protector is a challenge i would love to see samsung design a future model with the main glass easily replaced so i wont need a protector i added an urban armor gear case and the fit is great again
over all i think samsung is starting to listen again the phone is great I believe this is one of the best products I have owned I would recommend this product Phone overall is beautiful I continue to wonder how you guys get better with every phone Ive recommended this phone to all of my friends two of them have purchased it already thank you Samsung for continuing to get it right the first time everytime This is a great phone  The features are awesome  I can use window on here to complete homework assignment and drop it all into my dropbox multitask all on this phone You can even screenshot on s7 The camera is incredibly Samsung you guys really did amazing job with the camera Love this phone The design of the Galaxy S7 Edge is sleek and the goldplatinum color standouts without being seen as flashy The processor runs very fast and efficient from one application to the next with no slowdown The snap shot feature on the camera allows you to use your phone like a photographer The Video Talk is a feature Ive been waiting for a long time Now that its here I actually enjoy it more than the nameless other competitors video talk feature 
The only thing I feel missing is a Personal Assistant ApplicationFeature officially sponsored by Samsung Something like Siri or Cortana just better than those two Love this phone Amazing pictures and great features I am fairly clumsy when running around around the pool and toilet so dropping my S7 in water and getting waterlogged is no longer a worry Wireless charging has been a godsend when Im groggy at night and cant be bothered to use precision to plug in the USB cable The phone itself has a very high quality feel and a perfect weight Its almost a little too light sometimes which is good I dont even need to use a case on this phone due to it being built with gorilla glass 4 on both side hugged with a tough metal frame Everything feels much snappier than my S6 and I couldnt be happier Its been 3 years since Ive changed to a Samsung lifestyle and I havent looked back I upgraded from the S5 to the S7 Edge I am extremely happy with my decision The new features are amazing Great phone would recommend this phone I decided to upgrade because the Galaxy S5 did not support Samsung pay which I really wanted The phone seems faster than the 5 and the touch screen is very sensitive Im very pleased with the Galaxy phones and I hope they continue to improve so that I can continue to upgrade with them I have a sign on code for my phone and its because I registered with Samsung pay Samsung pay has a fingerprint sign on At first I didnt like that but then I realized that I didnt want someone to steal my phone and have access to my financial information Good job Samsung Keep doing what you are doing Though pricey buying it without a contract I know I made a good choice The camera is amazing and it helps me manage everything I could not be happier The only issue I have is it tries to use the multi window whenever it wants but it is easy to fix I love this phone I reccomend it so much because the features ate awesome and how it feels Consumer Reports was right  this is by far the best mobile phone ever not just for Samsung but overall The battery life and recharge time is far far superior to other phones that I have owned The added memory makes running multiple apps and switching between them a breeze Beautiful styling in gold  love the new Gold theme for the phone Fingerprint recognition is much much improved from the Galaxy S5 Pairs very well with the original Samsung Gear S watch I like my new S7 however I prefer the old operating system that my S5 had With Marshmallow theyve added clicks to things deleting a text message stringit seems minor but it takes extra clicks now

Also its disappointing that Verizon doesnt have a screen protector that fits edgetoedge on the S7 not the S7 Edge but even the S7

Other than that I do like the phone and love the camera Four family members and a coworker have all bought it I love how it pairs with my gear s2 Im a Samsung girl for life Switching was the best descion I ever made The dialer could really use an update Its hard to talk on the phone without hanging up on people Love the expandable memory and ip68 water and dust resistance Missed that in the s6 This is absolutely the best phone Ive ever had 

My first smartphone was the Samsung Fascinate I stuck with Samsung til my Galaxy S5 then went to Nexus for the pure Android experience My Nexus was so fast and smooth I swore I would never stray from a Nexus

So when it came time for a new phone I was very reluctant to go back to a Samsung because well they were ugly laggy and rarely received updates But when I seen the S7 Edge and saw how smooth it ran and how ugly it wasnt I took the plunge and I have no regrets This phone is flippin awesome I wouldnt trade it for any other phone I cant imagine it getting any better than this Highly recommended I just love this phone I went straight from a s3 to my 7 The Camara is awesome Switching from the 3 to this phone was simple and ready Ive been having the Samsung phones for a few years now and love the way they work Just recently got the S7 a like it so far This phone has great design features and applications that gives you personalized options on how you want your platform to look and feel The typing keys are very responsive and sensitive to the touch allowing for quicker typing speeds The Apps were quick to download and performed very well The phone fits easily into my pockets and is comfortable to carry The slender and edge technology is nice but makes it a little hard to hold without touching and activating something you did not want The picture quality is outstanding as well as the video quality but it lacks in picking up voices 2030 feet away The most important feature is the sense of security in knowing that if I drop it the screen will not shatter or if I drop it in water I will ruin it completely

I would highly recommend this phone to my friends and family So far I am very satisfied with this phone I previously used an S3 for three years and was ready for an upgrade This was definitely a good change Love the high quality sound and video Great for all sorts texts and good gaming phone as well Very fast and worth the money Good camera and more I have had my phone for about two weeks now and I could not be happier Learning new things everyday The camera is my favorite The first thing I liked about the S7 is the extended memory and the capability to add lots more with a micro SD card Presently I have over 100 Gs of memory The picture quality is much better and works great for taking pictures of my granddaughter who is in competitive dance The only thing that I wish could be improved is the battery life but it is still better than my old one The sound quality is a definite plus I love my Samsung phone I took fabulous pictures while traveling in the Caribbean Very easy to use The speaker location is easily muffled by hand Other than that you definitely refined the 6 and make me feel proud to own a 7 Kind of sad that my 2 year old Note 3 could do more things than the latest and greatest from Samsung Still cant control LED colors for notifications cant even control vibration notifications for all apps I guess I will have to wait until I can root the device to get everything out of a smart phone that I am used to The camera is awesome and I like the waterproof feature edge notifications need more customization ability Overall a good phone but still lacking Also disappointed that most accessories offered are currently on back order I found the Galaxy extremely user friendly I purchased the Galaxy S6 Edge a year ago and just recently upgraded to the S7Edge I am particularly enjoying the camera features as well as Samsung Pay feature The S7 Edge is the best performing Samsung phone I ever had After I disabled the ALWAYS ON screen feature the battery lasts for one good day
The design is great looks fancy the performance is fantastic I thought I would never get used to the curved screen but it was very easy All I needed was one good case
Performance wise in the 3 weeks Ive used it so farI havent experienced any issues whatsoever 
Once againI believe this is one of the best Samsung products Its a great phone simple as that Its quick and the fact that it comes with 32gb standard is refreshing The only flaw that I found was that before I got my case it was hard to hold the phone without touching the edges by accident As soon as I got my case that was solved The front facing camera takes incredible dim lighting pictures I was seriously impressed I believe Im a Samsung person forever now I bought this phone 1 week ago and love it I usually dont get new phones unless my old phone is totally not working but I didnt want to pass up on the deal that was being offered I previously had the S4 so I cant compared to the later versions ie S5  S6 There are some features that I wish it had like on the S4 unless I just havent found it yet The best feature to me is the camera The clarity on the screen is awesome However I do keep getting an error message that the Samsung Link is malfunctioning Dont know what to do about that Customer Support here I come All in all this is a great phone so far I luv this cell I would buy my whole family one of I could I travel allot and it works great I have had the Galaxy Edge 7 for about 2 months It is an incredible phone that suits me and what I do Everything about it design quality performance and features are all of high standards I would recommend to all Best phone out in my opinion Great design and features The edge screen is very useful The new marshmallow update has improved all system features The camera and battery life are top of the line as well I am loving my new Samsung phone and every time I show my friends they love it too its fast its reliable it lasts long its sleek it fits like a glove to my hand
I just love it It was a toss up between the S7 and the other one that everyone seems to like that I cant mention Boy am I glad I went with the S7 Love the edge features more than I thought I would The phone has a durable screen it doesnt need a screen protector I have it in a colorful case without a screen protector The sound system is even better than the previous galaxies The camera is off the chain it clearly photographs the smoke coming from food it had no problem video recording objects in fire Love the added design features Especially the removable SD card and added storage capacity on the SD card purchased about a week ago The design is nice and looks much better than the s5 I am noticing that randomly the phone gets pretty warm At times its pretty hot Not sure what is causing this to happen
The phone is a tad smaller than the s5 and is kind of slippery in your hand have to be extra careful when holding it I hope the case remedies this when it arrives
I like the fact that you dont have to swipe the home key for fingerprint recognition now you just place your finger on the home key Almost went with the new iphone but Im so glad I didnt It has all their features with the best of being an android I got the S7 when switching from another carrier because my Xperia Z3 wasnt compatible with Verizon Ive had Samsung phones before and they were nice but they kept falling apart after a while so I hope they fixed those issues with the S7 The only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is the battery life With the Z3 I would be able to go several days on one charge without ever turning on power saver or another feature I hardly use my phone throughout the day and it still decreases significantly The messaging is also a little irksome because they dont have one default text messaging app rather they let you choose between two of them which I thought was rather unnecessary

Other than that the phone is very easy to use reliable fingerprint detection works well the cameras are amazing both front facing and back its customizable but not overwhelming Im pretty happy with my choice I would have gone with the S7 edge but there were small features on the phone I didnt care too much about and it seemed to make handling the phone a bit more complicated so I stuck to what I thought was simpler Id recommend this phone to others looking for a reliable android that they can get the hang of quickly An awesome product for a frequent everyday user lifeline I am amazed at the vibrant colors and image quality Totally love my new Samsung S7 Edge So happy with it Ive always had a Samsung phone my last one was an S5 so I upgraded to S7 Edge and glad I did I have owned 3 Samsung phones The Galaxy S4 S5 and now the Galaxy S7 edge This phone is by far the sleekest fastest and nicest looking of them Im kind of glad I skipped the S6 models as they had non expandable memory and an internal battery Whilst the S7 edge doesnt have a removable battery the 3600mA battery does the trick Lasts all day with moderate use 
 The camera is amazing Front and back My friend has a iPhone 6 and used to brag about his camera He has since shut up with my new purchase 
 The edge screen widgets are a major plus Lots of versatility Everything from the sports ticker to the messaging pop ups Very nice Samsung 
 I purchased the Samsung VR headset with this Very very cool A little bit of a battery hog though With the headset had a little fan in there as the phone gets EXTREMELY and I mean EXTREMELY HOT But the experience is one of a kind Anywhere you go too 
 I havent yet tested the water resistant features yet but Weezy got my tempted 
 Must of the cases that actually protect the screen stress bulky notebook style and wont fit in my phone cradle in my vehicle do I opted for a slim generic case for just in the vehicle The notebook case I got the tech21 does the trick though good being out and about 
 The wireless charging is a major innovation I suggest the fast charger model as it sits semi vertical You can access the phone and see the side tile info in that position 
 The phone is a little pricey and getting the silver model is a no go at the store You have to order that model But all in all I would definitely recommend this phone I have to my friends and family already I have only had a note from Samsung in the past but heard great things about the Galaxy series I decided to try the S7 edge Its smaller than Im used to but is loaded with features and a great camera and the screen is brilliant I am in love Blows the Lumia 950 out of the water I also like it better than my iPhone but its taking some getting used to I love this phone It feels good in my had though a little slippery I bought a case for it as I was always bringing up a program while touching the edge of it
I do like the edge of the Edge and Im very happy with the preformance The battery lasts a long time through texting music and googling Im impressed
I have had the s3 s5 so previously and though I liked them a lot I love this one more I would never consider an iPhone again
Thanks Samsung I am very satisfied with how this phone performs The only feature I have not been satisfied with is the Samsung account problem with syncing to the phone If that can be updated to be compatible with S7 then Id be 100 satisfied I have been using Galaxy phones for a few years now and this phone is the best yet Samsung listens to their customers they wanted the SD card slot back well you got it You want the device to be water resistant again well you got it They deliver on so many levels This device has the best camera I have seen yet with perfect clarity and low light pictures that you can actually see The phone build is solid and feels like a high end tech machine This Galaxy phone is perfect for anyone whatever you wish your iPhone did well this phone can do it Thoroughly satisfied with three newest phone in the Galaxy lineup Fast has pretty much all the features I could want and looks good too Have not had it long so still getting to know the features and best wayselling to use The best deal out there It is schick Volume is perfect comparing I phone 6 plus Has hearing aid compatibility Water resistant Easy to use to download music pictures etc It has so much to offer for the price you pay I love my Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge This phone is so much better than the s6 in every way The battery last all day with no issues and I play a lot of games Great phone I love Samsung Galaxy line of products in general and had no qualms about upgrading to the 7 Edge when it was time 

I love the gold platinum which actually is more of a rose gold in real life I thought it might be too gaudy but its quite lovely It is light in weight but still feels sturdy  not as delicate as it appears and the water resistance is a benefit here in Florida

The Edge wrapped screen is great I hope they carry this feature on future upgrades of the Galaxy line because Im rather spoiled by it after only 2 weeks of owning one The camera is awesome and so are the speakers Lots of little features are beneficial like the always on clock when its asleep and the colored favorites that let you know whos calling with a flash of color

A good quality cell phone isnt cheap but the Galaxy 7 Edge is worth every penny to me I highly recommend it They have fixed the problems from version 6 made improvements and made a phone that stands half a chance of surviving my grandkids We are all very happy with this phone I have had the galaxy s4 s5 s6 aND now the s7 edge Up until now the s5 was my by far favorite and I was a bit disappointed with the s6 but the s7 edge has restored my faith in the Samsung Galaxy I absolutely love this phone from the edgy no pun intended design to the external storage to the water resistancy not to mention the outstanding camera and huge battery And lets not forget its a Galaxy It has all of the bells and whistles yet it still preforms like a dream Longercharge life Lots of space A lot less mandatory apps So I got my phone on the day it came out and I dont have any issues with it yet I love it so much has awesome battery life Screen is amazing and it is so durable The bottom right edge of the phone cracked picking it up from my bed the cracking when most of the way up the phone That seems very odd to me so I expect the phone further and noticed that edge of the screen did not meet with the chassis of the phone most of the way around I put my fingers around the phone and pick up the phone left and right gently and the left side of the screen went black the rest of the phone greenish and spiky looks like an EKG reading This phone is too small I have a rounded back and slips easily from the hand
 The battery drain really bad I cant get 5 hours out of it at minimum use without draining battery most of which is used up by the Android system so it must be a bug back glass is not sturdy and well scratch very easily as well the front I think the s7edge is currently the best phone out  the s7edge fits perfectly in your hand and has the most up to apps and really great features for the edge screen  I love everythinf about this phone
I started using android since the first design came out  and samsung took it to a hole new level with the galaxy line i love the design the apps the look the feel the camera is a huge plusno other like it very clear and vibrant screen I been hooked on samsungs i trie other phones but i keep coming back to this I should probably just stay for good thanks for an awesome phone samsung keep it up
francisco y Overall the S7 Edge is a really good design with really good features that are useful One major disappointment that I have with the phone is still the life of the battery In the grand scheme its a small drop in the bucket of the overwhelming positives of this new roll out Sleek design allows it to slip in your pocket like its not even there its very lightweight the processor speed is amazing theres no lag between opening apps internet connection for nominal WiFi amazing theres so many features Ive barely gotten to use all of them yet calls are crystal clear photos are great I also enjoy sinking to my PlayStation 4 for the double screen the wicked fast the best Samsung product and come out with yet Upgraded from the s6 Love it Been getting Galaxies since the s3 they just keep getting better Love the new features Wireless charging is awesome when running a business Just miss the remote features Great features but feel like it will break with any kind of drop I really like this phone because its is water resistant and brought back sd cards This is the phone you want Every feature that you need and want in a phone Best technology out there Do yourself a favor and buy this phone You will not be sorry But hate the battery life Ad said longer battery life but it is worse than my last phonethe Note 4

Please make one with a longer battery life and this will be a 5 star phone Excellent phone expect for poor battery life S7 edge is a great phone The screen just wows me everytime It just looks amazing to me the way it pops out It is the best thing about the phone that I like I had the note 3 previously so its a slight change especially without the SPen which I loved but none the less I love the phone And that edge I love how you can just put your apps on the side I dont like clutter so it just makes the overall use better for me I feel more organized One thing I do not like is that the phone is all glass I like it it looks sleek but I dislike that I may drop it and Crack it Phone is pretty fast longer battery life I love that they brought back the expanded memory and water resistant I love Samsung I upgraded my s5 to the s7 and couldnt be happier I even work at a cell phone reverse logistics company Samsung are considered to be the best and by far the lowest return rate of all manufacturers Features are outstanding and love the edge Im glad I skipped the s6 that didnt have memory card and have the s7
Recommended to all I love this phone Not sure yet if there is anything it will not do I have taken tons of pictures with this phone as well and the quality is amazing Even when the sun goes down I can still get pictures that look like there is plenty of light even without the flash on Everything loads very quickly Plain and simple I couldnt ask for a better phone Went from a Note 5 to the S7 and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it Not crazy about the camera I feel like pics on my note 5 came out way better but the performance of this phone otherwise is A1 I previously had the Galaxy S4 and it was a good phone but the battery never held a charge and I had to constantly have a phone charger on me at all times But now with the Galaxy S7 I dont need that and I love it I forgot what it was like to have a phone where the battery lasts all day Plus the fast charge feature If Im in a hurry my phone does not take long to reach a full charge at all Ive had it for 24 hours and I know Ill never go back Beautiful display 
Camera is amazing the water resistance helps with everyday use The s7 with marshmallow meets almost all my expectations in a smart phone The OS is fast easy and beautiful and the screen and camera are gorgeous They battery life is long and charging is quite quick The multitasking with the app pop outs with the new OS  processor is responsive and intuitive The phone itself is very aesthetically pleasing and the shape feels awesome in the hands The metal and glass body is quite slippery and prone to smudging though but this design choice is all the rage with main manufacturers of smart phones anyway Another concern with these materials is heat and shock absorption Im pleased to report save from fast charging and heavy use the phone remains quite cool and it never really is an issue but Id definitely get a case The slight curve in the screen is somewhat of an issue with some screen protectors at the moment but I imagine the manufacturers ZAGG will figure it out soon enough My only other gripe is that the phone has had an issue with audio in the software particularly use of the 35mm headphone jack Im not sure if this common but you may need to toggle the UHQ audio upscaling setting in sound to fix issues with static sounding playback Overall the s7 is a accessible reasonably tough and fast phone that I would recommend to any smartphone lover be it the enthusiast or the layman Its quite fair to say that this is one of the best phones Samsung has made to date I like the new lowlight camera feature The water resistance has been a long time needed Too bad its not gorilla glass screen tho I like that they reinstated the removable extra SD memory since s6 eliminated it Also more memory than 8gb is nice to have I wont deny I was an IPhone lover for many years I took a leap into the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I dont know why I waited this long to own one This phone is simply AMAZING The camera has blown my past phone photos away by a long shot Im learning all the different features and so far I have enjoyed everything this phone has to offer Go grab yourself a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge you will be so glad you did  This is my third Samsung Galaxy they are the bestimate products on the market and I own 3 tablets also will never own anything but the Samsung the only reason I have owned 3 of each is because always want the next best thing Samsung puts out This phone is awesomeIve owned Samsung Galaxy there is and this one blows everything out of the water  I really am impressed with the new S7 I am upgrading from a S4 which I have thoroughly enjoyed Love the new features as well as the familiar things carried over from prior phones I love everything about this phone My fav would have to be the camera Absoutely amazing phone amazing features and amazing product The Absolute best phone ever made Hands down the best fitting in your hand phone ever the Camara the quality of pictures and videos is amazingI dont what else to say its water proof Whaaatt holds a charge all dayGREAT PHONE This is the coolest phone on the planet Although I am not a technological genius even someone like me can see and feel the power of this phone I am so glad I held on to my last Samsung smartphone which by the way was 4 years old but ran like a charm despite its age as long as I did so I could upgrade to the Galaxy S7 It is so user friendly that I brag to my friends that I think my Samsung beats all other phones hands down The camera is awesome especially in a low light setting I took a photo of my friend in a dimly lit restaurant and the results were spectacular Apps are all easy to use and the layout and screen are brilliant If you are looking for the coolest and smartest phone get yourself a Samsung Galaxy 7 and dont forget the awesome VR set that takes you into another world The first smart phone I ever had was an iPhone 4s and I loved it until I got a galaxy s5 and realized what a good smart phone was supposed to actually be like Upgrading to android was the best thing I ever did and I loved my galaxy s5 but there was a few things I wish were different about it those things were changed in the galaxy s7 and I love it For example the visual voice mail app is phenomenal and an amazing feature I also very much love the theme store whenever I get bored of my background I can simply change it its quite the refreshing feature The audio is also a lot louder than my previous phone and the Always on Display makes it easy to always know the time without the hassle of unlocking the phone I could go on forever about how absolutely amazing the galaxy s7 is Im very glad I purchased it I am happy with this phone especially for the water proof IT picks up a lot better than other phones and a lot clearer Its clear and takes pretty pictures Definitely enjoy having this phone Havent noticed any slowdowns or hiccups and battery life has been amazing so far The only things that distract from this device are that is a little slippery and hard to find a good screen protector for it I have had the phone now for about 3 weeks The look and shape are great but it feels not a lot of features changed or were added from the latest model Poor signal poor performance bad antennapoor design I thought we are suppose to move forward and not backward when going 2 models forward not this time fail for Samsung There is minimal difference between s5 and s7
Definitely Not enough to warrant an upgrade Save your money and buy an old used phone for a lot less and actually works 
Had a better cell signal and service in my s5
I went backmy old s5 active after returning 2 of the s7 
So sad I had such high hopes My first purchase was an S5 when the six came out I was excited until I seen two features I loved were gone Which was the removable battery and SD The phone took on an iPhone look I was kind of taken back bybecause if I wanted an iPhone I would of bought oneSo I vowed to hold out and boy am I glad I did

Samsung turn it back aroundThey threw a bigger battery in so it takes some of that want to remove battery need out of the way for a bigger battery Then they brought the SD back and added to the ability to go up to 200 GB Way to go samsung The camera has changed on paper looks like lessbut visually definitely out of this world The camera focus is now spot on no waiting on it anymore Not to mention I am a mother with a toddler and it is great not freaking out about spills around my phone either THIS BEAST BLOCKS WATER LIKE A BEAR 

Price is still up there but after vowing I would never spend that kind of money on a phone now I am on my second one If you are up grading from a S5 or under you will definitely be able to tell the difference Might not be as drastic from an S6 This review is being done from my S7 I am not getting paid eitherYou wont be disappointed in this phone you will only be disappointed if you dont Love my Samsung Galaxy of products The only concern I see presently is battery life The S7 Edge makes it through a long day all the same but perches precariously in the red toward the end of the day I wonder though if this isnt in part due to the wireless charger compromising the battery life Pros Beautiful screen awesome pictures excellent processing speed lots of customization for Edge I use my phone for personal work and business matters It exceeds my expectations in every way The added storage over previous models is huge I no longer have to delete something to take a picture or add a new app The Samsung kid zone is one of my kids favorite apps We run an Internet business completely through this phone and it makes the businees completely mobile and easily managed I grew up in the era of party lines typewriters and snail mail and so I am constantly amazed by the power of this technology I highly recommend this phone as it meets all our needs and even some we dont know we have yet I trust in Samsung for a long time So now I have 5 of them and only had to replace one Because the flash quick working Then Samsung look at it and replace another one for me I have owned several Samsung Galaxy phones and was very excited about the S7 release Although I havent had it long Im glad I made the purchase and I know as time goes on Ill love this phone as I have other Galaxys Happy about the ability to increase memory Please consider the removable battery again

Samsung person for life would have liked a little more guidance on how to use the phone The little the salesman shows you barely gets you started I have only used Samsung for my phone needs for many years I started with an S3 and now I have my S7 I love the android platform and I also appreciate that the new phones are always similar enough that they are not hard to use Though there is not much that is different between the S7 and S6 I like this one better because of the SD card slot and processor run smoother I have owned several earlier Galaxy S version and this is the best in features camera and screen 5stars  Recently made the switch over to Samsung products and love all of the features and how well the product runs even afteremember months of use I switched to the samsung s7 Will never look back Hahaha I love everything about it I have recommended it to 3 friends and got them to switch from another style phone as well Fast and reliable high quality pictures I love it This phone is so much more durable than the S6 The battery life waterproofing and performance are much improved Couldnt wait to upgrade from the flimsy S6 Galaxy S7 edge is the most Beautiful phone I have every own and it feels awesome in my hands the screen is beautiful it performs without any problems I most say Samsung you guys did a great job I am just loving the phone Thanks for a phone I can really appreciate and I can use it wen I am talking a bath Wow Ive never had a Samsung phone prior to my Galaxy s7 edge I happened to be due for an upgrade and after reading the upgrades I was leaning toward the s7 I had some friends that had Samsung products and they all recommended Samsung to me
I can honestly say that Im really happy with my purchase Ive never been much of an iPhone person and I was blown away by how streamlined the phone was Its light not overly bulky and has a lot of features that I enjoy Great camera and video quality High processing power and the battery lasts me all day which is very important to me as I use my phone for all sorts of planning and activities throughout the day Either hardware or software have a glitch System freezes once in a while and needs restarting Otherwise a beautiful and easy to use phone Great phone love the design and Camera is fast and light weight This phone is great Ive used Samsung for my last four upgrades and will continue to stay with them Keep up the good work Samsung I really like my Samsung Galaxy s7 edge Its a really good phone i probably dont use as many of the features as i should so perhaps my expectations of pricevalue are a bit skewed having said that it is a very nice looking phone and performs well  meeting all of the performance requirements i have Not having used an Android device since 2011 I was a little reluctant to get another one I initially had the opinion that Android phones would glitch freeze and were prone to crashing After using the Galaxy S7 Edge I am not sure if Ill ever go back to another brand

Pros
Beautiful scratch resistant display
Clear sound from speakers
Fast internal GPU
Large battery lasting all day even you play it constantly
SIM card
Waterproof
Virtual reality with GearVR

Cons
Cannot remove the battery
Phone is encased in glass and is prone to shattering from drops must buy a case
SIM card and internal data storage cannot be combined
Bluetooth signal has dropped on a few devices after extended use car speakers I absolutely love my Samsung S7 Edge I love the sleek design I love the camera Previously having the S4 and before that the Droid Charge this is a huge step up Performance is amazing Ive been able to play every game in the android store with no frame drops including Implosion Dear Hunter 16  Dead Trigger I dont use the Game feature this phone provides but the launcher is convienient Navigating through the UI is very fast and accessing apps is faster than ever 

The design is very similar to iPhone which Im not very fond of The speaker is at the bottom vs being in a neutral area like the back or somewhere on the front Very awkward watching media and hearing the sound coming from one side of the phone but I guess thats what headphones are for Camera is amazing even through its 12MP Could be due to the 4k capabilities of the phone but between my S4 14MP  S7 this is a way better camera especially in lowlight situations 

Lets talk about the one feature that makes this phone stand out amoungst the others and that is the water resistant IP68 this device has Works very well underwater and Ive washed my phone in water plenty of times having it only for a month The only discrepancy I have is the USB killswitch it has if the phone detects that theres moisture in the port If you dont dry this device off quickly you may run into this notification about not being able to charge due to moisture Ive been having inconsistant problems with it Sometimes its willing to charge other times it thinks that theres moisture when I havent submerged it If it gets worse Ill have to get it replaced

In conclusion the value of this phone is ok with its amazing performance fast loading of apps but has a similar design to the iPhone with an awkward speaker Just make sure you dry your USB port as soon as its submerged otherwise you may face a frustrating not charging situation I have had every Galaxy phone since the S3 and this is the best one Great battery great memory with the SD card great camera The size is just right Just a little smaller than my S6 Active Extreme performance and great big sharp display Many great tools and features including quickstart photo fingerprint easy edge panel setup I wanted an upgrade form an older dying phone so I went with this fella and Im happy that I did

Positives
Its extremely fast the battery life is amazing and the camera is fantastic

Negatives
Im not a fan of the bloatware on the device but that was easy to get rid of so its not a huge issue
The edge screen took some time to getting used to since I would accidentally tap things I didnt want to tap This is my first foray into the android phones moving from an iPhone 6 plus The screen is gorgeous and love the optional gear vr system 

I have had some major software issues  the phone locking up screen not turning on and random phone reboots I have only had it 23 weeks and may already have to get it replaced My wifes phone however had had none of these issues 

I love the size of the phone It is comfortable in my hand and in my pocket The water resistant feature is great insurance against my kids

Goodbye all other brands They cannot even come close to Samsung 

You guys are amazing I absolutely love the Samsung Galaxy S7 Its a great phone and pairs great with my Samsung Gear S2 I love this phone Love the edge options and how versatile it is Its the right size and battery life is amazing I love that I can have my phone laying down and it will light up a certain color of certain people This is a 5 out of 5 for me I will be a Samsung Galaxy user for life I have been using a Galaxy S3 Mini for the last two years and am very happy to have upgraded The speed is amazing The clarity of picture is also fantastic I really enjoy having finger tips sign in Lastly the battery life makes it all worth it If I forget to charge my phone over night my phone will still last me the next day And the charge is fast I was reluctant to trade in my S5 for the new S7 Edge but now I am extremely happy that I did The speed is amazing the features are over the top I am hard pressed to find anything wrong I am using the Samsung Pay and love it I have not found any place that did not take it went from iPhone to Samsung and will never go back the amount of things you can do on this phone is amazing faster and pictures are so clear I like the phone except that it has gone black twice and had to reset I hope that you have a fix or will replace the phone as I have only had the phone 3 weeks I just traded an iPhone 4for this so I did step up I like the size and the durability of this phone It has many features but it is taking me a while to figure them all out I have had a lot of smart phones over the years and my most recent experience before Samsung was an iPhone I have never been so happy as the day my Samsung S7 Edge arrived and I activated it the moment it powered on I could tell it was going to be nice to be back into an Android device I had read the reviews and talked with friends that have the 5 and 6 edge phones but I was completely blown away byour everything about this powerful device I have only had it about 3 weeks and I am still exploring its potential WAY TO GO SAMSUNG You now have a loyal customer for life This phone is amazing Very slim and lightweight The screen is decent size and has amazing an amazing picture Great phone with features Battery last alot longer than other ones i have had in the past I was worried about switching from an iPhone but Im happy with this choice I learn new things I can do all the time i love my s7 edge it is ridiculously powerful the touchpad is too fast thats the only problem we have on edges This a great phone slim lightweight very fast on internet My only problem is that it wont connect the Internet on my Belkin router The last Samsung Galaxy I had was a 3so I was very surprised by the 7 It has everything you would want in a phone but it is just not that exciting It seems like Samsung made a better Android version of the IPhone 6s Sadly I liked my LG phones better I think most people would love it there is nothing wrong with it just wish there was more excitement involved New and better I love the camera Im a big fan of the 7 Took a while getting adjusted to the sensitive nature of this curved screen but after finding the right case the phone has since been adored The camera is oneofakind and incredibly HD The ability to takes pics at night and still look great not grainy like the old phones is hands down the best thing yet The processing speed allows me to have all 3 social networks up and running while listening to music and visiting different websites Did question the durability of the screen cause after a fall from a coffee table to a hard wood floor the screen cracked And this happened all within 15 days of having it The Samsung Galaxy S7 is such a fun and very reliable phone Has an AWESOME camera Definitely worth the price I paid Great storage although wish we had options for more other then thru SD cards
super fast reliable no major problems so far I love all Galaxy products they are very elegant in their design However extremely user friendly I refuse to have anything less and everything else is LESS This phone has so many great features I still havent learned everything yet The camera and video is amazing design and its completely lightweight Amazing phone Samsung great job Very quick camera takes great pics The best phone screen that exists Wireless fast charging is as fast as plug in Battery lasts all day Touch wiz is great on this phone Love it As others have said it performs slightly better than old models but everything else is the same The battery life is the same as what I was getting on my 2 year old s5 so thats a little disappointing I generally have to charge it by noon I skipped the 6 and just got the 7S It took me a while to realize all that it does every once in a while I find something newsmile but most of the features are very useful and easy to set up I am very happy with my decision to upgrade Love this phone but hate the software on it that pushes ads They blink on screen when I use certain apps that came with the phone  most recently with the media player Have read Samsung help and user forums and tried many things to get rid of them and Samsung states that its possible but nothing works so far Nice phone lightweight lots of new features Just a little small after the Note 2 Ive been with Samsung since the launch of the galaxy s in summer 2010 I then moved to the S2 S3 S5 and now the S7 I thought I was blown away when I got the S5 but lord was I wrong The S7 is ridiculously fast has the brightest display Ive ever since I can move between apps without lagging or the phone freezing Im so happy Samsung brought back waterproof and removable storage features thats what kept me from getting the S6 Best phone Ive ever had Have not had for long and have already recommended to many friends Told one friend today when her son damaged yet another phone but this time with juice Video app does not have auto play next and multiple video play during selection This feature was the best feature of my Samsung galaxy S5 I love the slim line design The swipe edge features are convenent
I ordered mine on line and setup was a breeze I love my new galaxy s7 edge the photos are phenomenal I have had the Galaxy S3 Galaxy S5 and now I Really Love the new Galaxy S7 Edge
It has the fastest processor I have ever seen  Applications popup no load time  None
The Camera is totally awesome with low lighting situations  it blows away any other camera I have seen The Image Stabilization and the slow motion video features are really great too not to mention a 4K image
Battery life is really good  I love the Wireless Charging
OLED Display  I will never go back to a phone with just a LCD screen The colors cant compare
The Edge Display is really immersive for videos movies and games The Contacts Apps and information feeds on the edge are very handy I am still learning how to use them I have only had the phone for 2 weeks so far
The quality of the manufacturing and design are really noticeable when holding this phone in your hands It feels solid balanced and comfortable The high quality manufacturing really shows
I Love this Galaxy S7 Edge Phone a LOT
I am recommending to everyone  I already talked a good friend into getting one  He loves it too
Thank you Samsung I have had my new for 2 weeks now and I have had a lot of trouble with battery life connecting to Wifi and syncing of my fitbit Although the battery charges extremely fast something is draining the battery on my phone significantly when I am not even using the phone I will be reaching out to a Verizon store for assistance but this is very frustrating As for the transition the phone features are almost identical and why I purchased this phone Hopefully I can get my issues resolved timely I love the phone and features Id actually use but dont understand why Samsung changed the operating system that is far more complicated then the last several models Ive owned

Overall Im still pleased but my only other issue is when typing Because the new design has curved edges to increase the screen size typing is is not as simple since the keypad edges extend to where the curves It often takes multiple attempts to hit the correct letter or punctuation mark because of the curves 

Id still prefer this model over other brands would recommend it to friends and realize Ill eventually master the changes Im having difficulty with I went from a Note 3 to the S7loved my notehad it 2 years and never had a problem but dropped it in water so I went to the S7absolutely disliked the S7screen was way too small to my liking So I was very happy with my S5 for the most part Battery life wasnt the greatest but I understand there is a trade off with so many features and performance and a nice phone to look at
The S7 has given me better performance better battery life faster charging times so I am a happy camper Very minor changes to the OS and menus but for the most part very easy to understand and navigate around Very powerful phone and can do just about anything I need The Play Store has everything I have ever needed in the way of apps so I am not missing a thing
So far I have had all positive experiences with this new phone and it has not missed a beat since I have first started using it I am very happy with it and I use it hard every day

Tom My previous Samsung phone was really poor on its performance and the battery drained drastically throughout the day It was always painfully slow and just not satisfying My new phone the Samsung S7 is great It runs very quickly and smoothly the battery lasts me almost two days and I just love it best phone Ive had by Samsung yet Downsized from the Note IV to have a smaller device Features ease of use are just not comparable Miss my Note IV I went from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the the Galaxy S7 Edge I love it The design is fabulous its slim and feels comfortable in your hands It has a fast processor so everything is quick to open I like that you can put an SD card for extra storage though it has a lot of space on the phone alone I recommend this phone to anyone its easy to navigate I like Samsung but yall need to stop coming up with new phones because they get better and better and that makes me want them I already own 2 and I use both I really like Samsung thanks This is an exceptional product all around comparing to similar device in the market The sleek clean edge with the sides notification is very convenient Great battery life so you need not to worry about your device going down too fast Love the size features  and the simple use A mini personal laptop in a pocket Love it nice resolution Recomendamos it to a friend I love the look and style of this phone The features it has are very accessible and easy to use I like the always on display of time date and battery level I have and use the wireless charger that is very cool and handy lt may be more the updated operating system but I really like the ability to close all open apps with a single click The size of the phone is ideal and the screen is very bright Overall flow of the device is nice Ive been a Samsung user since the dinosaur android  the S3 was created Since then Ive been hooked To me the best design was the S6 For the S7 Samsung shouldve increased the screen size just a tad expanded the battery life which was successfully done added the water  dust resistance qualities  kept the rectangular backing of the S6 Im not a fan of the curved backing But overall I would rate this phone a 9 out of 10 The phone works beautifully and looks beautiful It works to all my needs I purchased the phone as an upgrade from my S5 I couldnt be more happy with my decision I personally chose the s7 edge for the cool sleek look as well as the increased battery size over the regular s7 All in all this phone is perfect All I hope for now is more features for the edge screen Nice futures and great battery life
water proof is working great I want to try wireless charger now Absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S 7 I purchased the S7 Edge to as an upgrade from my S6 Active I like the idea of a phone that is built for real life and the inevitable accidents that come along I liked the look of the S6 edge however I was looking for something that could handle a bit more stress so I went with the Active instead When the official specs for the S7 Edge were released I knew it would be a great replacement I wasnt immediately sold on the always on display however it didnt take long for me to decide that it is a nice feature the bigger battery doesnt hurt either Overall I am extremely pleased with my new S7 Edge I love my new s7 this phone does everything I need and then some the speed of the processor is excellent no freezing no restarting works great I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge The display and functionality is like no other phone out there I love all the great new features of this phone The apps are great and easy to work with This phone tops any iPhone by far I love the bright display  awesome volume of the phone The battery life thoughtotally sucks I dont use my phone from 7am to 330 pm and it will be dead before 8pm at night I have tried shutting down all the options to save on battery life I have been through I phones from the first generation When I switched to the Androids Samsung only I was in love I absolutely love the processing systems on the Samsung I will never go back to any other phones I was hesitant to switch from the Note 5 but I am so glad I did Always been a Samsung fan so i knew the quality of this product would impress Design and practicality allow easy one hand accessibility to the edge functions The camera features are spectacular Very happy camper with my new phone I love Samsung They are easy to use I rarely have any issues My S7 is amazing Ive owned the s3 s4 and now the 7 Picture is great Just love it Been using the Galaxy phones since the S4 The S7 is great Light weight quick charging and the camera are all top notch my only complaint is the phone can get hot some times Very user friendly design I would recommend this product for anybody Overall a great phone Sleek design not too big great performance however it does get difficult typing around the edges due to the curved screen There are also odd times where the screen can get too sensitive where apps open up when unwanted Still a fantastic phone but the screen sensitivity does take a little getting used to I absolutely love the S7 Edge The features that come with the phone are super including the Edge screen I can really see the screen in bright daylight Best feature yet is the Wireless Charging capability LOVE this phone Took a little learning to figure things out but now its awesome Great phone but must have a memory chip to make it usable with only 32g internal memory is not enough This phone is so nicely designed light weight great size screen great camera Samsung already had a great camera but they definitely stepped up their camera game with this phone And how cool is it to have a water proof phonecome on If you dont own a galaxy 7 I suggest you invest in one now I love my phone and have been with galaxies for the past 6 plus years now Plenty of memory and great battery life Easy to use Love it Better than my s5 Very fast My mom who ishould a beginner likes it Out the iphone life yeahhhh My moved to Samsung is the best move ever Excellent phone storage issues solved apps for Samsung phones beats iphones life Samsung pay works to the letter fingerprint security and much more to discover Dump the iphones and get yourself the new Samsung Galaxy S7 you will discover a new world I havent give the s7 a 5 star because i havent given th3 ultimate test Putting it in water The reason i havent is because I have concern about the part you charge isnt covered  i believe if it gets wetits over I thing this it s a great phone i love everething about this phone the camera is perfect to take pictures at day and night is wather resistant whit ip 168 4 gb of ram up to 200gb expandeble whith micro usb Another thing i like alot its the samsung pay you can pay almost anywere somethimes people forget the wallet but you ken still pay whith the phone that its amazing 2k screen and record 4k for me its the best cellphone for 2016 I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to anyone Its not too big to hold onto Feels good in your hand It has a really good camera and the screen resolution is just right This phone is awesome I switch through many phone and this the one is the best yet it clean fast and reliable app that is compact able with this phone is amazing storage area can be a just by a micro SD chip I can switch from one SD to another quick but I dont use 200 Gb on a phone unless to put music and movies on it while not streaming  The good
 Replacing an older Galaxy S4 its night and day better just for the ability to have more apps installed and faster processor
 Love the fingerprint unlock for the phone and especially LastPass
 The split screen is also very easy to use compared to the S4
 Always On screen is great to use when you are waiting for a response
 The camera is amazing for lower light photos
 Android Pay is easy to use and fastersafer than a credit card

What could be better
Out of the box all the cool toys are turned on which drains the battery fast
The trick is to learning how to manage usage
 Disabling builtin apps that you dont need
 Turning off features that are power hungry
 Configuring power saver and ultra powersaver to further manage remaining juice
 Accepting that an external battery is essential to have security that your device will make it through a full day away from a charger Costco gave me one for free

What drives me nuts
 Why make a phone so slim and slippery that you need to buy a case that makes it more secure and easier to hold Why not just build it that way in the first place and increase the battery size while you are at it This is the greatest phone I have had Ive owned Iphones and Samsungs LOL my first phone was a Bag Phone so Ive had a lot of phones

Samsung hit a home run Great smartphone the comeback of SD card plus the higher MAH battery made this the perfect phone for me Going from the S5 to the S7 has been a big approvement I like the design and the feel Seems a little smaller which it is Not for sure about the built in battery But hope it lasts the whole life of the phone Many different features Love the phone very much Samsung outdid themselves with the Galaxy S7 Edge The camera is amazing as are all of the modes available on it The battery life is better than I expected and I love the Edge features Keep up the good work Samsung Youve turned this once avid iPhone user into a dedicated Samsung user TeamSamsung This phone is great It has better speakers microphones and a brighter display Its fast and has all the bells and whistles I wanted my old phone to have I also really like the size appearance and weight The camera is awesome
Itll be a long time before I need to upgrade
Thanks Samsung its a complete power hog even with notifications and displays all turned off 18 hr standby forget it Lasts about 8 hours before I have to recharge and thats normal use a few phone calls and texts DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE THIS MONTH MY FIRST MONTH USING THE S7 IT HAS USED MORE THAN 18GB OF DATA I HAVE ANOTHER WEEK IN MY BILLING CYCLE MY PLAN IS FOR 15 GB OF DATA I RELY ON THIS PHONE FOR WORK NO DATA NO DISPATCHES NO MONEY NO JOB IT ALSO HAS A COMPATABILITY AS DO THE S5 AND S6 WITH PLANTRONICS VOYAGER AND LEGEND PRO HD HEADSETS I WILL BE GETTING RID OF THIS PHONE AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT It does what I need it to do and maybe a little extra It works and doesnt stall or freeze so Im happy with it There are so many features to this phone that I would not exactly say that I just like one This phone has amazing speed and game qualities are excellent I like the fact that you can record a game while youre playing The only thing with the S7 is that the screen could be as big as the S7 Edge Overall this phone gets two thumbs up from me This phone is a beauty to behold and from a utility standpoint hits all of the right buttons I like the features great sound and pictures too No issues was worred about getting use to the edge but found it extremely useful and cool Previous phone a Galaxy 3 and loved it This thing is a data hog Rarely went over my Gigabytes and now with 19 days left on my cycle looking at going over my data in the next 2 days I do the EXACT same things I did before Used 32 GB in one day on email alone  NO DOWNLOADS Something is seriously wrong with this phone I love how quickly this phone charvest It helps alot The features are great I havent had any problems at all with it so far I love the design of the phone Not to big but big enough Its going And super fast And the camera is amazing So far I really like this phone I love the edge features and the camera  And the battery life is great  I have 2 Friends that already followed my recommendation to acquire the S7 Edge Combined with Android Marshmallow and Next Launcher this is the device Ive been waiting years for I actually use most of the features and benefits because its fast enough to not keep me waiting for program loads and screen rendering Amazing device I show it and talk about it all the time

My Note 4 was very close but thanks Samsung for getting it completely right  This phone is incredible it has so many features that I have never seen on any other phone the speed is fantastic Best device ever It is so simple to use

Samsung S7 edge now differ form S6 edge which is great 
Phone looks and feel high end and with Gorilla Glass 4 its very durable We got these when they came out and within 6 weeks both of us have scratches on the screens and my husbands phone cracked from a very short fall in the car We both had S5s before this and those were way more durable  never a scratch on them in 2 years actually neither one of us has ever had a damaged phone in 15 years and we havent used any special cases or anything For the cost it should be at least as durable as its predecessor Amazing phone with endless capabilities Only downside is that it tends to get super hot for no reason The size of the galaxy s 7 is perfect and the features that it has meet all my needs I had the galaxy s3 I jumped to the s5 and then the s6 edge plus but this phone was different than all the others its performance is five star just everything about this phone is great Thank you Samsung I really appreciate how u guys have made such a good phone You guys have the best devices Im satisfied After my LG G3 recently failed I decided to give the S7 a try I previously owned the S4 and was happy with the product The S7 is essentially an updated S4 with better features and hardware My personal favorites include the water resistance and super fast processor Other notable features include the fast charge which can charge the battery in about 40 minutes a powerful camera with many options and photo finishes and the always on feature which displays the time and other information with a small price on battery life Overall battery life isnt great but it hasnt caused any problems so far I would highly recommend the phone and I am very happy with my purchase My new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is so fast and the battery life is much longer then my last phone Samsung Galaxy S5 Active I havent had any problems with it crashing on me I have been an iPhone user for many years and resently switched to android and I do not regret it the least bit The program features and performance is awsome My only complaint would be how fragile this phone is unfortunately it cracked with one fall I find this so supposing and disappointing because when I had an iPhone 6 it took a lot for it to crack I think although it is waterproof the it lacks durability The screen the is very fragile but awsome phone non the less I would invest in a new one no matter what I love the program the color of the phone its an awsome product Would never go back to iPhone  You guys came a very long way This phone is amazing the battery life is perfect the fingerprint works 100 times better the speed is insane fast and the camera speaks for itself Great Job guys Keep the good work cant wait to see the s8 edge One of the best smartphones on the market today Lightning fast processing speeds fast charging technology etc Only thing I dont like about the current galaxy s7 is that they removed the ir blaster for controlling tvs and other electronics Other then that its the best on the market Love the display features and customization of this phone It has a good camera and speakers So far cant complain about this phone I love everything about this phone I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 and its just amazing I love all the features and the themes You you should try it and see if you dont love it This phone is fast great to look at and I love the expandable memory Unfortunately the build is the least durable of any phone that I have ever owned Before I could get a case the phone fell from 2 feet and shattered like a windshield in a high speed collision To compound the problemthe screen is glued to the glass so it is a 270 repair Ive owned a Galaxy S3 S4 S6 and Note 5 and although Ive been pleased with these previous Galaxy phones I have to say that the S7 just really is the perfect smartphone in overall design screen size unique features like waterproofing processor speed and battery life Basically every aspect has improved with the S7 The only thing I would add is an infrared blaster but other than that this phone is simply amazing Anytime I need to know something its great all I have to do is ask google Have own Samsung phones since the beginning This is by far the best phone I have ever owned There are many things it can do and very few things it cant do My son has always been a iPhone user and now he switched after seeing the capabilities of my galaxy 7 edge Battery life is horrible Occasionally feels slow I have to keep it on charger for most of the day to make it through I wish I kept my 2 year old Windows phone Love using this device Very sleek Its makes me confidence in my day to day operation on the phone and carrying it around The product has very great qualities from the look of the phone to the components The quad core processor is definitely a great feature because it allows me to upload and download faster than my iPhone would let me I also enjoy the camera the pictures come out very clear and precise which is a really big deal for me since I love taking photos I also love that the phone is water resistant and that the SD card slot was brought back because thats what definitely set Samsung apart from Apple Definitely an overall great device Love the speed and response the screen is bright and Vivid the sound is great love this new phone I truly enjoy my Edge The Edge design makes it seem like the screen does not really end I was hesitant to go back to a Samsung phone after my old S3 would overheat in my cargo pocket I have not had any overheating issues The only problem I have had is that the notification try does not show up all the time when I use my phone The screen just blurs instead of showing the notifications Love this phone the only downfall for this phone is that the battery life is not nearly as good as the galaxy s5 I had before I upgraded Other than that very satisfied Water Resistance is the most important feature of this phone The S5 also had water resistance and was perfect for me

Performance on the S7 Edge is great the best Ive seen in a phone or any touch device really Perfect for gaming and pushing the limits

Sound quality is excellent both call and media sound quality and volume are excellent

The edge is pretty useless for my personal use but turning it off seems to extend battery life a bit and lets me exploit the giant battery this device offers

The camera is fantastic takes amazing pictures

Every feature of this phone is excellently planned out and it looks great The build quality and design is sleek thin and easy to hold for long periods Its nearly perfect for me ergonomically

The only real negatives are the fingeprint magnet back of the phone I have always loved the Samsung phones I am lowing the galaxy Saturday 7 Buying android phones has always been a compromise Do I want a big battery or a phone with a good camera A phone that looks good in the hand or one with the best internals Finally FINALLY Samsung has stepped up and made a flagship phone that checks all the boxes with almost no issues My phone lasts through a workday with light usage and still has 6070 battery left Wireless charging Check Killer camera Check Expandable storage Check Not to mention the myriad of incredible other features like the Samsung GearVR I dont love the glass back but I get that they needed the style points

Amazing phone This has to be the greatest phone I have ever owned and its waterproof and has a SD card great Good one
Noticed that Applications consume battery
Excellent camera and no doubt
Its get hot sometime when I take it out of pocket
browsing speed can be improved
More features need to manage applications I will be a life long Samsung user This phone is great use it for the camera it takes great photos of my food creations I love that has the ability to save more on the SD card Quick responsive love this phone and water proof 
Ron H After all the reviews I was expecting a much better phone Overall an amazing and worthwhile phone Besides a few minor WiFi problems the phone is outstanding Fast and user friendly Really happy with the phone thus far Great features and easy to use Easy to use features great pictures LOVE LOVE LOVE I absolutely love my new Galaxy Edge 7 I previously had th six and love the edge screen features with the 7 edge screen I love that I can add more contacts and even more apps or check my data usage all at the swipe of the screen The camera is so stunningly clear that my photos look professional and with me being a all star cheer coach I can record the routines and play them back to girls with HD quality and sound Speaking of HD even my phone calls are crisp and clear no matter the call volume This phone has helped me manage the extra tasks thrown my way during the week I love that the expandable memory is back and that I can upload from my old memory cards Overall I ADORE my phone and wont be jumping ship to any other brand anytime soon I had the 1 and 4 so when I seen they had a 7 coming out and I could buy one I went to get one Im so loving my phone only had it for 3weeks now still learning some of the features but its awesome I am very impressed with the phone I strayed away from Samsung and will never do that again I went on every site and read countless reviews and compared to several other phones I expected a few things to just be but found that even the negative reviewed features just hadnt been explored enough by the reviewers My only complaint is that it doesnt hear me correctly No device has Im still working on it though Very happy for the money The phone is very touchy I have had 1 major issue where the screen went all black and it had to be reset The camera options are very nice Otherwise I think most of the features are the same as my old S5 I do love how fast it charges Upgraded to a new phone first brand new phone in about 5 years In the past I have purchased used and refurbished phones Please keep in mind that I use my phone for business By the end of the day the battery life is really not measurably better than my old phone Droid X Personally I dont like the fact I can not find a way to highlight unread text messages which is important to me for business Also alerts for email and text messages are not erased after I open them to see what has come in This means that I have to manually clear these alerts which is a hassle when you send messagesreceive emails multiple times throughout the day The camera is great I will give it that The plastic screen protector that came with my phone is not as big as the screen which obstructs visibility on the screen Storage on the device is limited which I plan to expand with another sim card
I have also experienced problems moving photos from my phone to my PC manually and had to resort to emailing them to myself which would not be an issue if there werent many images But moving 50 photos can be a huge hassel Having had the S6 the S7 was a natural choice Processor and Ram work very well for a fast and smooth operation While the battery was increased somewhat it was not enough but I would rate the battery as acceptable Screen is top notch WiFi is super fast wifi calling is wonderfull speaker sound is good but not great Overall this is one of the best phones of 2016 if not the best I love the features of this phone I have owned each of the Samsung Galaxy S and they just get better and better And how can you not love a waterproof phone I have been a long time iPhone user and was pretty down on Android devices in general after using about 5 of them and all of them having issues Google and Samsung have their act together now This phone is amazing the feature set blows the other OS out of the water Between wireless charging water resistance touchwiz no glitches good battery life etc I dont even want to touch my work phone anymore iPhone You wont go wrong the 55 display is as big as the iPhone  but is compact enough to be pretty close in feel to the regular 6 or 6s I absolutely love this phone Very fast processing and easy to use I would highly recommend this to everyone Ive used samsung since the Note 2 and then Note Edge but really fell in love with the S7 The features are great no lag and size of the phone is perfect one of my favorite features is the camera the picture quality is amazing I switched from the iphone 6 to this phone I do like it bUT there are sometimes when it freezes up My iPhone did this but it was almost 2 years old I was so excited to get this phone but Im thoroughly disappointed It constantly crashes especially when on wifi has problems charging and is just a pain to work with I would think it was just my phone being glitchy but my husband has the same phone and he has the same issue My first cell phone was a Galaxy S2 That phone actually lasted me almost 4 years The phone still worked when I finally upgraded It just didnt have any memory left for updates therefore it just kept getting slower and slower The Galaxy S7 really impressed me with all the new features and ease of use I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone that appreciates a good stable easytouse android phone This is one versatile smartphone Easy to use brilliant screen and sharp design Very legible water resistant and overall excellent Highly recommended This is my 3rd Samsung smartphone and that is the correct way to describe this device Very SmartPhone I love it and will not change manufactures Even purchased a Samsung smart TV for my office Love it But it doesnt get a good signal  My daughter talked me into the new S7 from Driod Maxx WOW  I am so she did this phone is outstanding The camera is great the battery life is great great phone Best Galaxy phone yet I would recommend it to everyone I love it Battery lasts forever Its nice and big for things I like to do on my phone Having a cheap phone will teach you to truly appreciate a nice one I am so enamored by my new Galaxy that I proudly show it to everyone I chose the gold version which nicely compliments my car It is fun and classy at the same time Whats on the inside is far better There are so many functions options memory and capabilities on this phone that its akin to having a new toy everyday I honestly doubt I will ever run out of new treasures on this model Great phone where can you get a device that can do it all and is water resistant I live near the water ocean and it is a awesome feature that works The camera is outstanding and takes great shots a little work still needs to be done in low light situations but I would put it against many of the high end SLRs out there 

Awesome device So far Ive been very impressed with the phone The look and size is great It took my SD card from my S4 with music and pictures on it with no problem Pictures and video look great Havent tried low light photos other than seeing what came up in a very dark night shot It did get an image but it was very pixelated Only drawback to design is that without a case the edge can be sensitive to being touched by your hand while holding the phone Love that you brought back the SD Card slot feature I had missed that with my Samsung Galaxy s6 Active Its skinnier of course than my s6 Active which I love and the screen is bigger than my s6 Active Ive only had my phone for a little over a month now but I just love it more and more everyday I love that you have made the waterresistant a feature on all your phones not just the Actives Also love the fingerprint lock feature It loads apps faster than my s6 and the picture quality and modes seem to have improved over the s6 I say keep up the great work Samsung I have been a fan since the s3 and will continue to be a fan I always recommend your phones when friends and family are talking about getting a new phone The Galaxy S7 is great it has all sorts of features Some of the features are the Quad HD screen that is great for Virtual Reality the fingerprint sensor the magnetic payments the feature rich camera and the heart rate sensor The processor is fast and nothing has lagged like on my previous phone the Galaxy S4
Some things do still need to be worked on The Galaxy S7 still has a customized TouchWiz version of Android Marshmellow Updates will take quite a while to reach my device You cannot make this look like pure android even with the download able themes that do help The fingerprint sensor is commonly inaccurate much more often than a friends iPhone Fast charging while using Google your phone brings the tentative to over 100 degrees on the right side of the phone and it gets uncomfortable without a case It will need a case or at least tempered glass since it is slippery Ive had nothing but a great experience with this phone so far Everything runs fantastic the camera is phenomenal fits nicely in my hands and has some really cool features The only downfall that ive seen is that when the phone screen is locked all my push notification never dissappear unless i manually clear them It makes me feel like a savage for it to be doing that when the phone is this great Existing phone is top of the line The camera is wicked fast clear and easy to use The phone is the same My base complaint is that you need to trade off on protection for the device If you want screen protection you cant have a case because itll lift the protector off If you want a case no screen protector has yet to work with one Anyways though the edge feature is also nice to have Very convenient I love my new samsung S7 It works great The camera is awesome Phones in general a little pricey I was nervous about switching from an iPhone but I love this phone Easy to use and awesome features Takes amazing pictures I have really been happy with the phone its pretty fast and I like the options for privacy and increased notification settings it has only down side Ive found is if you use some thing like zedge for ring tones it automatically sets it as a default instead of the old option of asking if you want to use once or always Also when turning mobile data off it always asks if youre sure instead of just doing it is a little annoying Overall Im pretty happy with it Got this phone as a gift Couldnt have expected any more Phone is waterproof and I have dropped it in water many times The S7 Edge is not only good looking but the responsiveness of all functions is impressive as well The screen is absolutely beautiful Its bright with brilliant colors And of course its BIG Love the low light camera Great display Super fast The only thing I would change is to be able to use the phone as a remote like in other Samsung phones I have owned The galaxy s7 is a wonderful phone All the features are great works like a charm Fast and reliable Love love love it The Samsung Galaxy edge is a fantastic phone The style and beauty catches the blind eye than grasps their attention with the limitless features the phone has to offer The cool Samsung pay feature works flawlessly along with a speedy processor that transforms your phone to a mini pocket machine Do be careful with this phone as you would any other Ive only had the phone 2 weeks and accidentally dropped it and cracked the screen pretty bad so dont put to much confidence in its featured gorilla glass protect it with a screen protector as soon as you can to properly protect your new best friend But all in all absolutely great product Samsung This phone has done a complete 360 from the S5 days I upgraded from the s4 which I loved to the S5 I felt there was NO changes to the phone No wow factor Kinda the feeling of why did I upgrade Lol I went to another phone not in your life ios but another manufacturer I kinda overlooked the S6 but when the S7 hit the market I was like Ill try it What do I have to lose I purchased this phone over a month ago and love it Easy to hold love the spilt screen I can finally play music on YouTube and do something else without stopping the music Im sure you all know what Im talking about The phone is smooth and its not contested with bloat ware Keep it up guys Ive upgraded from an S4 and this phone is great I do like that the speaker is not on the back any more so I dont have to flip the phone when using speakerphone I do miss the ability to have a removable battery though even if this phones battery lasts a lot longer than my old phone This phone is amazing it may be expensive but it is well worth the price After having the galaxy s5 then upgrading 
there are many new features I just wish it was clear instructions in using all the features The upgrade in ram and the core strength are amazing The design is great I love my phone I just do not like the fact that it is all glass and will break with the first drop This is absolutely the best phone Ive ever owned Im not entirely sure Ill get rid of it when the S8 comes out There are a few minor features in previous Galaxies that are now gone that I wish Samsung would have kept but overall I cant complain and am more than happy with this new generation of the Galaxy Fast reliable great battery life The water resistant feature is perfect Dont expect to go a full day of lightmoderate use on one charge Yes it charges quickly but I dont want to connect to a charger twice a day If you use the battery saver it can go a full day but it cuts back on the processing power I bought it for the advertised 24 hr of usage time and the 4 GB of RAM but it seems like you have to choose one or the other Its a good looking phone and has some cool features but if youre not by a charger all day probably not the phone for you This phone is amazing the battery life is outstanding I went 2 days without having to charge which is something that hasnt happened in a long time It is very fast performs really well under high stress games and applications It is by far the best phone Ive had in a long time It just keeps getting better with every Galaxy I buy Im never disappointed Overall the S7 Edge is easily the best phone Ive ever owned It is quick easy and comfortable to use and feature rich

Samsung Pay is fantastic and can be used almost anywhere I was reluctant to try it in smaller venues without taptopay but found that I could use it anywhere from the corner store to big box outlets I use it almost exclusively now

The edge display at first seemed like a gimmick to me However I have found it to be useful for notifications in meetings and quick access to my contacts

If you are going to buy one do yourself a favor and get the Gear VR as well You get a full featured VR setup for short investment I am amazed at how well it works

The only downside is screen protection With the edge display it is near impossible to get something to keep it from getting scratched up I have tried several products and none live up to their promises Samsung should probably jump in and provide a reasonably prices screen guard for such a pricey phone Phone looks slim yet stylish and easy to carry anywhereAlso extra new features are wonderful Its been more tha 2 weeks and still i am exploring something new everyday Ive owned Samsung phones since I had a red Samsung flip phone From then on Ive loved the innovations and quality of their phones My entire family owns iPhones but I refuse to change I love how I can manipulate my phone to my liking Im not into the whole this is the product we offer Like it or leave it Keep putting out great products and Ill keep buying them Awesome device I wish it came with a quick start guide that included more of the features available on said device Im currently going between an iPhone 6S Lumia 950 and now this beast Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Im loving the form factor Just beginning to get reacquainted with using Android over my preferred Windows 10 mobile I seem to have all the apps I desire though I havent been able to get S Voice to act right so far I do have the Gear S2 and these two together have been great I have owned a Samsung before but I was not impressed or happy with it so the next time around I choose another brand This time in I thought OK I am going to give Samsung a other try and I love this phone I thought my other phone was great but I like this phone even better My only draw back is that my other phone was a little bit bigger than the Note4 and I am finding this phone just a little harder to hang on to but I am sure that I will adjust to the smaller size Had to take back to store to reset after an update Was unable to turn oof screen or phone Had to do a reset I really love this phone I have been having a wonderful time playing with it This is the best phone I have had in a very long time Its easy to use has all the bestuff featureso and an amazing battery I went from a gs4 to a gs7 and could notbe happier It was truly like coming out of the stone age of smart phones This phone does everything I could ever want Mainly this phone is used for work but with the better battery life i find myself listening to a lot more pandora and with the multi link Bluetooth capabilities it works fory headset as well as in the car at thesame time Still getting used to the samsung pay app and the finger print scanner could use a little work but over all this phone has surpassed my expectations we got two of the s7 edge and we love them both have had no problems with them and they perform great amazing picture quality I had the original MotoX and needed something new I was not a fan of past Samsung phones due to their TouchWiz frontend Theyve really cleaned it up and toned it down with more pure Android flavor coming through Im really happy with my purchase and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it Great phone beautifully designed looks fantastic Love that it is water resistant The phone works really well Easy to use Has just been great overall Its got a nice sleek designvery nice cameragood battery lifeand tons of great features for the phone savvy individuals Great design over the last model where the storage choice was set in stone with 32 64 128 instead of choosing expandable storage which is the case for the s7 Phone is pretty much water proof which I tested on several water rides recently on my Florida vacation I find it impossible to keep this phone from changing settings movingdeleting display icons

It is completely annoying Samsung phones are kind of like a person with plastic surgery They may be pretty but sometimes theyre just adding unnecessary features

I havent had a Samsung Galaxy phone since the S3 I didnt care for that device The amount of bloatware already on it slowed down the general experience for me and toward the end of my 2nd year with it the battery life slowed down significantly

I switched a different android phone during the time of the Galaxy S4 thru S6 I enjoyed the experience but part of me still had a desire for the flash of a Samsung device 

I had heard of the rave reviews for the S6 and heard that the S7 was just an improvement upon that and decided to give it a shot 

So far I have been very impressed with the S7 It is a gorgeous looking device but I never really cared much about that Id use a phone shaped like a foot if it had cool features and operated well Luckily the S7 looks great and operates great as well

 Yeah it still has bloatware but with an improved processor it doesnt slow down the phone Some of the 32 gigabits is already going to be taken up by Samsung apps but unless you have a ton of music andor videos your still going to have plenty of room to play with Also with the return additional micro SD storage you can always add more My other big issue with my old S3 was the battery life wasnt very good Theyve answered this by adding a bigger battery and including a lightning charger for a fast recharge 

The always on display is a nice addition for those of us that use our smartphones as an alarm clock The water resistance will take away your anxiety of dropping the phone in the toilet how does that happen anyway What are you doing in there 

Speaking of private things The fingerprint unlock gives you security but is way quicker than using a PIN or trace pattern Ive really been enjoying the Samsung pay as well It doesnt work with everyones debitcredit machines but Ive had about a 90 success rate and since using NFC payment isnt used that much where I live I get looks from cashiers like I may a sorcerer when it does workso I got that going for me 

Theres a few minor things about the phone I dont like The speaker being on the bottom I feel was a bad choice If your holding the phone vertically youre likely to accidentally cover it with your hand a couple of times and generally the speaker isnt that good Sufficient Yes An improvement No Im probably a little spoiled from having a device in the past which had two speakers I also dont like the choice to put the volume keys on the left side of the phone I have a kickstand case and when its sitting on its side its on the volume keys it makes adjusting the volume a little inconvenient 

Like I said earlier these are such minor things that shouldnt scare you away from the Galaxy S7 Probably the best Andriod phone on the market right now I have simple needs when it comes to a phone I want a good camera long lasting battery and clear connection for phone calls My previous phone did not meet any of these needs So far the Samsung S7 has been great Samsung cameras are known to be good Photos are sharp even in low light The voice quality during a call is amazing as if the person is right next to me And the battery lasts all day Performance is snappy Very happy with the phone Being a farmer Samsung Galaxy Note 3 owner I am very impressed with the Galaxy S7 and its features I like the grouping of the ions and the double touch camera home button feature I like the looks and the design of the phone Steel news to using this phone and discovering all the features with it So far my only disappointment is the battery goes dead quicker than I thought it would I have had the galaxy s series phones since the s2 Now obviously it goes without saying they have some a very long way and I recently upgraded to the s7 from an s5 I opted for the gold because it looked the nicest out of all of them in my opinion and I have to say it looks very nice The only issue I have is the battery life doesnt seem very improved against the s5 granted I charge it nightly but I would like it to be as good as my wifes s6 active just because the battery lasts so long However overall I adore my s7 and I am glad I didnt get the edge Awesome phone Then only complaint is the back feels like the front Im constantly picking up the phone thinking the back is the front This phone is very fast and smooth The camera takes excellent pictures even for someone like me who doesnt mess with any settings and just points and clicks at crazy kids and dogs The back button and volumepower buttons are on opposite sides of my previous HTC phone so that has taken some getting used to but that is my only issue so far Had this for about a month now and Im loving it I love the innovative technology Samsung has to offer to us
I have Samsung phones and tablets there awesome  
Samsung keep up the good work  I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND I TRIED ALL PHONES AND THIS IS THE BEST ONE EASY TO USE I WILL ALWAYS STAY WITH SAMSUNG PRODUCTS TRY IT  YOU WONT REGRET IT TAKE THIS FROM A OLD WOMEN I love this phone it is way better than The iPhone s plus I tried the iPhone first and didnt like it Keep getting knocked of on wi first voice mail doesnt work Carrier said the phone needs upgrades that are not available yet I wouldnt recommend this product to my worst enemy Great reason to go back to the i phone Simply put this phone is amazing Short on bloatware and very very fast I have been impressed with the ease of use and customization options available with this phone As a prior htc and iPhone user I was skeptical but have found this phone to be more reliable and much more customizable I love the s voice I love the voice mail features I love everything about it Absolutely amazing phone Would recommend it 10 times out of 10 I usually dont upgrade and was very happy with a Galaxy S5 I owned The S6 did not seem a true upgrade The S7 truly is It has better battery life better camera and is fast I like upgradeable memory and the fact it can take a bath like my S5 I have taken underwater pictures with it Two new features I really like are the Samsung Pay that works on ALL credit card machines I have tried Much more useful than that tap and pay format I do a lot of running and hiking so the newhole blood Oxygen reader is awesome So far no complaints I love it A real uograde My main issue right now is that my phone keeps locking up and I have to reboot the phone Its everything they say it is and more Its fast reliable durable and lightweight Its powerful and convenient I love this phone It is an amazing phone with a great touch screen great speakers amazing camera quality and just overall exquisite phone The feature I love the most is the Virtual Shot that takes 3D view I also love the pro feature that makes it like one of those expensive Nikon cameras Another thing that I love is the video call feature that it has in the default phone app Really amazing that I can converse with my family like that Another thing I like to do as well as my girlfriend like to do is customize the theme of the phone to my preference It is great when the theme of the phone changes it also changes the apps theme as well The camera is really sharpthe pictures are clear The screen is great Waterproof feature and external memory got me Its an awesome phone only complaint would be battery life I love the different things you can download for the camera I received a VR headset with my Galaxy S7 and it is much more fun and realistic than I thought The processor is also faster than the Galaxy S6 I just upgraded from My new Samsung s7 was functioning correctly until the tenth day the for absolutely no reason the device lost all screen function and was black  My carrier replaced it with a new one I own several different Samsung products and have had few problems hopefully this was just a one time incident and look forward to using this phone  But I must give a 3 stars review for now  This is a great phone I absolutely love it EVERYTHING about it is 5 starsexcept

 Only comes in 32gb size This is plenty of space for me right now and not currently a problem I have all the apps I want But my last phone was 16gb and it was fine at first too and then at some point 16gb became impossibly cramped 

 The price is high Not that you dont get a great value but still it doesnt come cheap The different promotion Bogo and gear help soften the blow

 The edge screen is awesomebut its super easy to inadvertently trigger actions while handling the phone This is a nuisance but I put a clear case on the phone its all glass even the back and that provides just enough buffer to eliminate the issue for me This is a great phone glad that brought back the external memory everything is excellent the only thing is the fingerprint marks  The camera is very stable and easy to focus and take great pictures
The resolution is excellent and shots are visually breathtaking
The battery lasts longer and does not drain even with heavy usage This is a great phone with lots of extra features The new Galaxy 7s Edge is amazing I cant believe that its got so many features packed into such a compact design Im extremely happy with my purchase Love it fast sleek design and easy to handle Love it This phone is the best smart phone I have had the pleasure of owning and using The graphics are amazing and the curved screen allows functionality never seen before I have this phone in a case with a glass screen protector I have dropped the phone a few times and had no ill effects It is light weight and has excellent battery life Signal quality is also very good it seems to get good signal strength everywhere I go Samsung edge 7 is really nice and useful i really like the way am able to keep open all the windows so i can come back quick Ive had the s3 s4 and the s5 and loved them I didnt get the s6 because I didnt like not being able to put extra memory I love the upgrades on the s7 especially the camera Comes in handy with a photogenic 2 year old running around So far havent had any trouble or complaints about this phone I only buy Samsung phones because their phones are the most innovative and the most advanced phones ever made The prices of their phones are steep but you have to look at what you are getting with the phone you buy and you will agree that the price set is very reasonable for the most advanced phone that money can buy I love my Galaxy S7 Edge it does more than my computer I have replaced my computer with my phone because thats all you will ever need You get the very latest Android operating system and the very latest hardware that will replace your computer and even your TV If your looking for a new phone then look no further you have found it I just love how I can make the galaxy s7 edge my phone I can make my own widgets for quick access to apps Its very convenient and makes life so much easier Phone is so much faster than S3 Split screen is nice and I really like the wireless charging and the fast charge wired adapter Comfortable to hold and use Phone is reliable and will get the job done Only problem I have with it is when you are holding it your hand rubs on the edge part and messes up your text or whatever you are doing Best Samsung phone by far Love the size design and functionality I like that it has more memory on the device The camera takes great pictures And the battery lasts a lot longer Compared to other galaxy phones this feels built a lot better Feels a little things without a case for someone like me with bigger hands But with a case no problem This phone is amazing it is light sleek and more powerful than ever when you add in the features and capabilities it puts all other phones to shame Samsung is light years ahead of others with this phone I upgraded from an s3 to s7 and love this phone The display is unbelievably clear and crisp The size of the phone is just right and the cameras are great 

The battery lasts all day but this phone battery does drain more quickly than my husbands S5 even with extra features turned off I have noticed that when listening to music the speakers sound a little scratchy when the volume is up Best phone ever Fast and great graphics with lots of accessories and options Love the graphics and the way the phone works Would have scored higher however the phone is a bit large for my hands and the battery is not assessable Love the other features Would like the speakers on the phone to be a bit louder for usage with the alarms Overall I enjoy this phone very much It was a nice upgrade from the s5 the one complaint Id have is the edge is hard to hold without the edge press screen and opening apps I dont wanna use there is no where to hold phone but its features are great like water proof the phone has quad core and 4 gbs of ram so its faster then my previous s5 This phone has a really cool looking design has great features and is easy to use 1 Splash proof never lose a phone due to a spilled drink
2 Need more memory Buy a card that simple
3 Nice camera excellent in low light situations 
4 Not to big for average hands
5 Its a Samsung To say the least Samsung has always made the best phones interface wise My s7 edge has brilliant colors and I love the way samsung brought back the SD CARD slot The design of this phone is beautiful and it has everything you can ask for Again for iPhone lovers dont even try it It might be difficult for you to understand the awesomeness of this phone With so many android devices in the market galaxy s7 edge has features where you wont miss anything at all I love my phone and would recommend this phone to all the android users especially I replaced my s6 edge plus with this phone Once again I compared other phones and once again samsung seemed to be leaps and bounds ahead I couldnt be happier with my decision The new S7 could very well be one of the best phones Samsung has ever made With the combination of Android and Samsungs design this phone without a doubt blows away the competition The improved feel in your hand and the new water resistant design makes this phone a must have for anyone that uses their phone as a daily tool The only issue I have with this phone is the voice command It doesnt always know what Im saying and doesnt find what Im asking it to If they made it more like Siri it would be the best phone ever It has a lot of great features and is very durable From the start I have really enjoyed this phone There is nothing to complain about My first smart phone Nice but very sensitive switches screens with slightest movement very small keyboard I need to use a stylist good apps and works well am pleased with settings as i was concerned it was too small for me but i can customize it
vr is the most wonderful thing if you follow the directions All good except the battery life The features are very easy to use I went from Samsung 4 which I loved to Samsung 7 transition was smooth the phone is lightweight and fast I love the cordless charger I aslo have the rapid charger which is incredibly fast Love love love this phone Super fast handles multiple open apps and background operations and split screen with ease Its not huge but its not small I personally think its the perfect size for a smart phone The apps that are made specifically for it are amazing as well Very intuitive Does everything I need a cell phone to do has excellant call quality I had a S6 edge and this phone outperforms that in almost every way The battery is significantly better

But there are a hundred different problems with the WiFi that Ive seen on threads For me when I have Bluetooth on the WiFi is either very slow or non existent This may not be such a problem for some but Id prefer being able to leave Bluetooth on instead of toggling on and off This is the only thing bringing my rating down 

This MUST be a software problem just fix it The 12mp camera works great in low light
I feel the battery life on the device has improved
Processor makes device run smooth The main reason I switched to the S7 was for the excellent battery life and it has not disappointed me It is also faster and sharper than my other phone Would highly recommend it The Samsung Galaxy S7 is smaller than the S6 Edge which is something I really like The features are very similar and I dont notice a whole lot of differences One thing I dont like is that I dont get the notification sound on texts if I have the window open Maybe I just havent found a way to do it but I prefer to hear the incoming text message when Im not looking at my phone whether the text window is open or not The one real good feature I really like about this phone is that when I make a phone call and put it up to my ear when my headset is not being used I can actually hear the person on the other end I dont have to worry about my Mom not being able to hear me or I hear her
The other features are well I just love them I dont need to tell any of the previous Samsung phone owners that The reason I bring it up is because its my first Samsung phone Its not my first Samsung product Oh no I have been a Samsung product person for quite some time 
My first smart phone was an iphone It was a good phone but in comparison to my Galaxy S7 to me there is no comparison I love the Galaxy S7 I would recommend it to anyone interested in features that are available with this device There are too many to describe but on a one on one conversation Well theres alot to talk about In fact Im looking at my phone just now and just thinking how much I really love this phone After one day I cant believe how great my S7 Edge is Its ease of use color navigation and I could go on and on but all I can say is youve got to try it to believe it I had 2 different phones they both overheated during the 5 an while on the charger Great battery life and runs fast Much better than my s6 Overall a great bounce back for Samsung after the S6 flop Bringing back the SD card and making both phones waterproof was truly Samsung listening to their customers Battery life is better lasting a full day with moderate to high activity I really enjoy the video call capability with other S7s a pretty neat feature I didnt have high hopes for The phone audio is a major improvement The speaker in the ear piece seems much more powerful and clearer almost sounds like your wearing an enclosed headphone The phone feels solid similar to the s6 metal design Still recommend getting a case for extra protection 

The cons are nit picky but in my opinion would make this phone unstoppable in a head to head with iPhone First software updates from providers Stop the incessant reminders I as the customer choose which software I want to upgrade too and on my schedule Apple has won this battle by not forcing customers to update and allowing them to delete updates from their phone Give customers the choice to install software updates from providers and Samsung People will stop rooting their phones if they dont have to deal with annoying popup software update You mean they will stop rooting their phones if we stop the pestering reminders they cant turn off YES Next Samsungs Svoice feature could be better In fact it doesnt recognize voice well and is tough to use during hands free  OK Google works better so I started using that instead Other than that this is a real quality phone that you will love minus the price This phone is perfect every time I touched itI smile Very impressed with the style Had a s5 before This phone has so much more to offer Easy to use and easy to learn new features It takes beautiful clear pictures Very happy with my purchase This phone is as good as if not better than other Samsung phones that I have had The design is beautiful Huge clear screenwith CURVED EDGES The new color is hot and makes the phone look ultra premium Water resistant and battery life is terrific No complaints other than the price I really like the ease of using the phone straight out of the box  The edge option makes finding apps much easier  but the cases for the phone dont really protect the edges And the cost of the phone was way more than I wanted to spend but I love new technology  and the volume on this phone via speaker or earphones is significantly lower than my previous phone Got this one and sent it Back Its way to small of a phone compared to my note 4 I will wait for the note6 This phone has excellent reception Great features and user friendly I would recommend this product to anyone I often find myself performing the wrong function because I am touching or have touched the curved edge It wouldnt shut itself off and restart a dozen times a day All the reading Ive done shows that a single app or a combination of apps is causing this I would rather it be fixed on their end rather than me having to delete apps one at a time to find the culprit In all honesty this is the only issue I have with this phone

Right out of the box the phone looks amazing As always its very easy to set up and get your accounts up and running It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand Everything that you need is within thumbs reach For those that have used an edge phone before you will still enjoy using the edge functions Those that are new to it will love it

Performance is amazing There is nothing this thing cant handle Except for certain apps see comment above The camera is great during the day but absolutely amazing in low light conditions

One of my favorite features is the Samsung Pay Easy to set up and even easier to use

All in all a good phone Samsung needs to fix and major bug for me to consider it great Best phone I have owned to date By far outshines all of my friends devices I upgraded to the S7 from the S5 and boy what a difference While the phones are actually very close to being the same size the screen on the S7 is far superior

 I am a little scared of the all glass back and it does show fingerprints horribly While I used the S5 naked I bought a case for the S7

 Fingerprint reader on the S7 is amazing Just place your finger in it for a second and it reads it and youre good to go Samsung has out done themselves again This phone is both powerful and elegant all in one I am very pleased with my new s7e So far it is really nice overall Just needing to get use to a few things but otherwise great If you liked the other Galaxys you will love this as it is them and then some take everything of them and just increase its quality by ten fold My previous smartphone was like a sleek sports car the design was eyecatching and pleasing the features were beyond expectations the performance was overthetop but it has one problem  it had a 2 gallon gas tank The battery life was terrible You had all of these impressive attributes but couldnt use or display any of them because you were always tethered to an outlet somewhere Very frustrating
With the Galaxy G7 I now have the complete smartphone package It takes all of the great attributes of my previous smartphone to even greater heights AND has a sufficient size gas tank to boot Finally we have a balanced system that includes a battery that will take me through a normal day and at a fair price point It doesnt hurt that now I can even drive it in a rainstorm with its improved water proofing
Great job Samsung Ive had tons of Samsung phones Note 3 Note 4 Note 5 S5 S6 and now the S7 and notice a huge difference when I went from the Note 5 to S6 in performance The 4 GB of RAM makes a big deal IMO After having the S6 for a few months as soon as the S7 came out I jumped shipped and had to get it I ended up with the S7 Edge and the performance so far has been better than any of the Notes I had which the Note 4 and 5 were amazingly fast The edge is a nice touch and allows me to easily open apps with just a quick swipe Performance aside I get tons of compliments on the picture quality on the display It has a way of making a picture look 3 times better than it actually is The vibrant color and the quality is top notch This is definitely the best phone Ive ever owned The Samsung 7 is a very good upgrade of the Galaxy series and the battery life is excellent Im loving this phone so far The only thing Im a little worried about is the built in battery So far so good though 
This phone is a lot faster and loving the SD readdition The camera is amazing and although this phone is totally waterproof I have to admit I havent tried soaking it in Champagne just yet I think this is a good phone for the fact that it is water proof and has a good size screen I upgraded from the S5 Its smoother faster sleek with some new odds and ends that make it a great phone Camera is awesome

Battery life could be better but Im a Samsung fan If you dont have one get it and throw them I phones in the trash My husband dreaded getting a new phone but the S7 made it easy for him He really likes the HD sound We also got one for my motherinlaw and we love that she can connect to her Wifi to make phone calls at home because she doesnt get cell reception there Were also impressed with the battery life I have always been a Samsung person my favorite samsung galaxy was the s5 because of the water resistance and the SD card however I also liked the s6 because of the camera and the ir blaster so when the s7 was announced it was like the s5 and the s6 were fused together The s7 has met all of my expectations greet battery lifegreat camera SD cardwater resistance Only thing the phone could be missing is the IR Blaster There is so much thing to do with this phone and the camera is beyond exceptional My whole family switch from using iPhone for almost 5years and we did the right choice for waiting for galaxy s7 Highly recommend for everyone to switch I love the sleek design of the phone but its whats under the hood that makes this device so great The Samsung Pay is awesome and can be used almost anywhere The water resistant design has saved my bacon a few times already And the high end specs make this phone one of the fastest and smoothest devices i have ever used I have really enjoyed this phone I opted for this version vs edge because I am partial to the original style at this time System works well and I havent had any operational issues Features are nice Camera is awesome and the picture on the screen is sharp and colors are vivid Love MY NEW PHONE ALL THE FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A NEW UPGRADE Amazing phone Best battery life Ive seen on a phone Great improvement on the last version Finally a phone thats perfect for everyone including us gamers My battery power is super strong and the water resistance is awesome I love my phone I cant get over how great the camera works Great graphics The galaxy s7 edge is perfect for me with its new edge features my most simple apps are just a swipe away Not much different than the S6 They should have put a little more into it This phone is the most dynamic phone Ive ever had It has great quality best screen best video and allaround great phone everyone should have one it puts the iPhone to shame Lots of nice features love the look wireless charging is sweet great looking phone easy to figure out I switched for the iPhone 5s and it is a huge upgrade Phone works good FULL of uninstallable bloatware Locked bootloader should be against the law If it is your device you should have the ability to do what you want with it Including using your own custom ROMSoftware Android is opensource and is not designed to be locked down I love thia phone Works so well Very fast great performance and speed All the apps makea it easy and saves time Would recommend to everyone BUY THIS PHONE I got this phone a week ago and I absolutely love it The best phone of 2016 ever Love this phone and always the best phone I ever held and the phone is very attractive to me in silver titanium Very user friendly great styling and the return of the SD Card is a very welcome returning feature I love everything about the phone The battery almost last 2 full days Its very fast I do miss the IR blaster but i love the sd card I got a samsung pro 128 sd card I have no preformance issues I also wish it was the size of the S7 Awesome phone By far my favorite one over the years Great battery good camera fast at most tasks I would buy it again This phone is totally awesome I absolutely love the Virtual reality headset along with the BB earphones this phone has great attachments Also for a great price I got a lightweight waterproof and bright display Form and function for the S7 edge are both amazing From the first moment of turning it on it is clear that the device has learned all of the lessons from within and without the Galaxy line of phones Sleek smooth and with expandable memory it has all the things I loved about the S5 the things I wanted in the S6 edge and none of the things that kept me away from the S6 Bringing back the SD card slot was a must

I miss the IR blaster and hoverover features like photo previews But the larger battery more than makes up for the loss of the removeable back and the water and dust resistance without a charging port cover is amazing The builtin wireless charging and removeable SView cover are all delightful plusses

My only complaint so far is that the new edge features take a lot of getting used to I keep bumping buttons when trying to operate the phone onehanded because my fingertips curl around the edge Its also sometimes infuriating to type words with a keyboard that touches the edge of the otherwise amazing and beautiful screen I did immediately replace the TouchWiz launcher though because Im a total addict to infinite scrolling home screens 

Images colors photos fingerprint integration and Google integration are all superb Samsung Pay is a sea change for mobile payment and I cant wait for more banks and cards to get on board I cant rave about that enough

It also works so great with my new Gear S2 I only wish that they could track my sleep better but thats another review 

All in all this is the best phone Ive ever used  Samsung or fruitbased I have been using Samsung forver and I just cant get enough of it This phone is amazing features are perfect all around I really like this phone Ive had Samsung for years but this new 7S is the best My favorite feature is the camera Its easy to use and the photos are clear and crisp The zoom feature is awesome and easy to use I was very reluctant at first but I took the chance and I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed This is a great piece of equipment Easy to use and with the upgrade in memory it has taken the place of my old phone and iphone and my ipod 160 gigs
 I would recommend this to anyone Money well spent product well pleasing This phone is pretty awesome my only downfall is the screen I love the edge but I have no way of protecting my phone if it falls on the screen This is my second edge already Good phone pictures great but battery does not last long have to charge every day Smaller than galaxy 6m faster than any phone Ive had Had galaxy for 5 years now Overheats when charging overheats when used screen is often unresponsive pretty installed apps are not usefully and unable to be deleted This phone is great picture quality is great I havent had it long and I dont know all of the features yet but what I have used is very good It has a lot more features than my old Samsung The phone is as great as I expected it to be The display is great and the design is even better It has a great battery life and last all day even with major game play Couldnt be happier with any other phone I had a Galaxy S5 for a couple of years and was waiting for an updated version but thought I wasnt quite ready for an upgrade however when I went to the phone store to pay my bill I found the Galaxy S7 The employee went over the new features and I was hooked It has been a great phone with wonderful features especially the camera I have to say Ive tried other brands but no other phone has the features and reliability that Samsung has I will definitely consider Samsung as a primary option when I decide to shop for a new phone in the future I have been a Galaxy fan What I would like to have seen is a thin phone in Rose gold I would have also like to see smaller size All these phones are getting bigger and us woman would like a phone to fit in our hands as I have small hands Also the charging port should be redesigned On my previous phones it came loose and made hard to charge on my S6 You should remove the little middle prong peice 

Other than that pretty good phone so far ThED waterproofing whether you need it or not is handy just in case Design is far better than previous generations The fingerprint access is well designed and works flawlessly The camera is way better compared to the 5 or even 6 Low light images are much more clear and colorful Display gets brighter than the max brightness when in direct sunlight making it much easier to see outside Speaker is quality Fast and smooth processing of applications Core phone works as well as always Samsung is quality I upgraded to S7 Edge from Samsung Note4 I did not need the S Pen The just fewer less wide screen on S7 Edge as compared to Note4 actually makes it easier to hold while still being a Phablet enough for me The batter life is way better as well The built in wireless charging is awesome as well as the ability to add 128 GB memory chip for all I would ever need in memory space I dont like the hold placement on the screen when I am talking There has yet to be a screen protector that works well for the design for all edge phones I bought this phone for my son He absolutely loves it It has great features This new phone is awesome I am able to have multiple windows open and still message to coworkers Runs really fast Take great pictures The finger print security is great I now use my phone as a kindle and am able to carry a book with me where ever I go Im able to get my work email and personal email all on one device Used the GPS today and the screen size is just right to place the phone between the dash and the front wind shield but not obstruct my view Love it I love this phone Featurescamera speakers almost eveything Only draw back is when you want to put on a screen saverhardhard hard Then when you put on a case it bubbles Ive had this phone for several weeks now and Im very pleased with the upgrade from my old Galaxy S5 Im really really really happy that they brought back the scard support for this release Never lose that again The ease to connect it and use it with my Gear VR Slender and elegant but battery life is only average Im really happy to got my new Celphone Galaxy 7 Edge I switched from the iphone 4s to the galaxy s7 edge and could not be any happier The display is beautiful and so clear The 16 mp camera takes really crisp and clear pictures I have had Samsung for years starting with the Note 2 until the Note 4 when i switched to the Samsung s7 and s7 edge I switched because if the exception camera and the comfort of use It feels comfortable in my smaller handsbut yet its not so small that I cant still run my businesses from it Great Phone just wish it was less expensive This phone is similar to the other ones Ive had the S35 but more advanced The camera is excellent I think the speed of things are faster Although the phone charges really fast the battery doesnt seem to last long I find myself charging more often than I did with the S5 This phone is good for calling and using the Internet at the same time 

Over all this phone is faster pictures are clearer calling its like the person is in the same room This is a perfect phone for college students business professionals or anyone who needs to multitask at times In pro mode camera has all the same features as my dslr and does a better job of taking pictures I low light I was a huge s5 lover before this phone and if the s5 had more memory I probably wouldnt have upgraded This is a great phone its fast has decent memory Samsung pay is awesome but I really miss my ir blaster it took me two weeks to find my remote The battery life is fantastic and the wireless charging is probably the coolest thing ever Also If you answer your phone with a Bluetooth headset your screen will not lock in your pocket cause accidental mutes and hang ups The functionality of this phone is phenomenal By far the best device Ive ever owned State of the art design fast prrformance excellent camera Very sleek aluminum frame with a curved edge screen bodacious screen resolution in the UHD arena Fast charge frature with more battery ah reserve than most competitors You really cant go wrong with this phone based upon initial use Lifespan of phone is unknown We were very reluctant about giving up our Samsung Galaxy Note 4s that we upgraded to from Note 3 with same reluctance but just the same or even better outcome we were very delighted with the new phone and have not thought about going back The phone is everything Samsung claims it to be and morevit quickly becomes an integral part of your life Size shape features Performance and fun We are loving our new Galaxy S7s The free phone was a plus but not a must We would havre upgraded anyway

K n I Love the design Phone battery drains too quickly but power save feature is great  Would also like to see finger print scanner work better Also would like more display customization features To control screen timing out Great phone Works perfectly A lot of features to learn I absolutly LOVE this phone The design is outstanding Its so beautiful Its incredibly fast and feature full The battery is wonderful This phone lives up to all of the hype and Im thrilled with my purchase I listen to music all day at work and the fact that this phone cant read texts out loud to me through headphones like my last one did without a 3rd party plugin is a real disappointment So much so that Ive been struggling with whether or not to return it within my 14 day buyers remorse It may seem like a small thing to some but my hands are busy doing other things at work so when my boss or someone sends a text and I have to pull out my phone unlock it and swipe down or open messaging app to see a message thats inconvenient
Other than that the camera is great the phone is fast and the waterproofingdust proofing kept me from opting for insurance and instead just went with an Otterbox I love the S7 The battery lasts much longer than the S6 did I really like the Always On Feature with the clock that is always visible and doesnt drain the battery either 

The only complaint is that Samsung did not include the IR blaster on the S7 I really miss the Peel Smart Remote on my phone I used it more than any other app I was very disappointed that I could no longer use that app with my new phone

Other than that disappointment I love the S7 It has subtly improvements from the S6 that make it more user friendly Love that it is waterproof too Good features and design Study device and clear screen Coming from the note 4 to S7 was great The battery life alone was worth the switch I did not switch last year because of the lost of the extra storage SD card  I was used to an IPhone but when I changed to this phone it was simple to operate and easy to get used to its every day use S7 brought back all the best qualities of the S5 with a nicer and fancier look Water resistant for active life but sleek look for personal and business use
I loved my S5 but I love my S7 more Samsung Galaxy X 7 is a great phone with long battery life and a fast processor I love that I can be on the phone all night long at work and not run down the battery Sharp colors Steady camera havent blurred shot yet did frequently with my Note 3 Until now I was a die hard iPhone owner My new S7 has converted me to android and specifically Samsung Newest model in the Galaxy lineup Performance increase over the 6 is pretty good coupled with the newest android OS Addition of larger battery and SD card slot is nice on top of waterproofing If the fluid design of the phone does not catch your eye then the functionality will The way the phone handles when you use the touch screen is fluid If you enjoy games on your mobile device the screen brings out the eye popping graphics of high resolution games The sound from the speaker at the bottom is surprisingly loud and decent 

The performance from the CPU is spot on as well I rarely if ever see any performance degrading while gaming or surfing The new android IOS has very few hiccups if any at all so far If those few things do not convince you to buy this phone you should look into the Samsung Gear VR headset also I was quite surprised by the VR headset as I thought it would just be a gimmick but the VR unit was far beyond anything I had imagined It is hard to describe in words personally so I recommend seeing if your phone carrier has a display up to test It also has built in wireless charging along with cable fast charging From 20 to 100 on direct cord hook up the phone charges in 25 hours and on wireless charging about 3 to 4 hours

The battery itself is bigger in this phone but still consumes a lot of power from it while sitting idle I can be playing on the VR or games for hours without much worry Yet the sitting idle seems to drain it more This is about the only Con I can think of to the phone Other than a few quirks with certain apps the phone has been excellent The camera is exceptionally clear I have not experimented with filters but it has resulted in clear pictures even once enlarged Doesnt anybody test these products before they are finalized If so I think they would have figured out that when you hold the phone to your face while talking it is very easy to hit the hold button with your cheek Come on dont you try this happened first time I use the phone First offguard I have to say that it was VERY DIFFICULT to find a flaw in this device
The S7Edge is an AMAZING DEVICE with TONS AND TONS of options and performance that surpasses my EVERY expectation I can say without a doubt that the fact that this is WATERPROOF makes the S7Edge the BEST option on the market today The only con I have is the BEAUTIFUL finish on the S7 and S7Edge is IMPOSSIBLE to keep shiny and clean It is VERY slick and shows fingerprint and smudges constantly The slick finish is also a con in that the phone slides out of a shirt pocket and will not stay in place when laid on nearly any surface HOWEVER this is in NO WAY a reason to pass up this REMARKABLE CELLULAR DEVICE
I have owned approximately 2025 devices and I have NEVER been more satisfied with my purchase 
OUTSTANDING I love my Galaxy S7 It does everything I am never without it Im still learning all the features on this phone I made a big jump My last phone was a Galaxy 4 which was also my 1st Android I am so happy that I can add memory to this phone too as I use the camera a lot The camera on this phone is awesome too I take photos outside in nature and you would think I was using a professional camera Also love the theme option I can change the theme of my phone with season or mood Im in
I am truly happy with my new phone This is a great phone not quite the same as the note 4 but it is a quality product Cant say enough about the camera excellent pictures  glad you brought back the memory expansion could have a few less apps that cant be removed Great phone Absolutely love this phone wouldnt change it for anything Waited quit awhile to upgrade Went from S4 to S7 very pleased Love the SamS Pay useit all the time and very easy to set up and verify Very sleek design light and portable Great features First time buying edge version  Love the side bar This phone by far beats out the competition IPhone isnt even close I love the new s7 The battery life and performance is better than previous versions Having extended memory capability definitely helps The fingerprint feature is also great and I love exploring my new phone everyday I wish it were a little lighter in weight though I had the 6 Edge now the 7 not Edge and Im hooked I have owned many Samsung phones and by far the S7 has the best camera features and processing of all its predecessors I do wish the screen was bigger Durability is a plus Liquid resistant is a huge plus Overall Im very satisfied I got my phone 2 weeks ago brand new and a few days ago my power button and the button to lower the volume stopped working Its a brand new phone what the heck Besides that I really like the phone but if I cant get this fixed Ill have to get a different brand Im really disappointed Good purchase but kinda pricey Probably worth it Need more experience with it Ive owned several Samsung galaxies at this point  I like the S7 but the battery life is absolutely terrible compared to my S5 The camera is wonderful but its really hard to work around this battery draining so quickly Sure I can put on the battery saver and shut down all of the apps but if I cant have my phone functioning the way I want it to what is the point of having the phone The battery life is my only complaint Otherwise I love the phone For the size of it I cant believe that Samsung couldnt have put a better battery in it Also not happy that the battery isnt removable so I could have a backup Had an s5 this has way better camera screen functionality and etc highly recommend One of the best Phones out there Easy to use and set up The performance and options are outstanding The curved screen gives a very nice view Great phone Many features Great camera Still learning all this phone has to offer Very dependable and very fast I love Samsung products and would recommend this phone to anyone It is high quality money well spent This phone is so convenient and userfriendly Screaming fast as well I have been hooked on Samsung Galaxy products for several years Pleased with improvements along the way This is a good phone battery life is better memory is better Love the big long screen Picture is crystal clear Phone processor is very fast This phone is amazing The camera is great and the added water resistance is a very nice peace of mind I would like the battery life to be better but this phone is so great that it doesnt bother me Keep it up Samsung The best phone ever Its capabilities are amazing and I absolutely love it Ive been a lifelong iPhone user who made the switch to the Samsung Galaxy S7 for its water resistance ANT capabilities and Samsung Pay with absolutely no regrets The phone is great for active individuals who are looking for the cutting edge of technology and features Been with Samsung since the first Galaxy came out with the key board even then I thought how could this product get any better Samsung is here to stay Samsung has done it right with the S7 One of their best phones yet all things I wish for a phone to preform this phone does and with flying colors Really enjoy the samsungs7 edgelots of cool appsgreat picturesgreat phone A phone for anyone This phone can be useful in any where you want to be like your money Just for a month now i took it everywhere even the shower Wow Keep it up samsung keep it up I am a loyal Samsung user but the Galaxy 5 software was a nightmare
All is perfect with the Galaxy S7 Ease of use screens and reliability are A Samsung actually listened They took the best of the s5 and the upgrades of the s6 and combined them The best part is the removable storage I love my new s7 I love my phone but please fix the SD card issue But Im sure an OS update will fix it Other than that this phone is awesome The camera takes great pictures in any light and are crystal clear I got this phone over the Note 5 because of the bonuses that came with the phone and because of its uniqueness This phone first is very slim and light weight
The features such as the low light picture taking of the camera to the way it is designed Enjoy the new music and samsung apps Love the color Size is nice not too heavy The battery life is much better than any of my previous smart phones The edge features are great specially for quick access to certain things Great and elegant design The features and options are endless Great and reliable phone Battery is pretty decent for how much I use my phone love the quick charge Bought this Samsung about 1 month ago and it is not as easy to work with as my Samsung 3S Crashes at work for no reason frequently Cannot use my bluetooth with this phone2010 car does not recognize this version of phone The phone is a good phone and it has a good camera to take pictures Good camera fast software a lot of features solid phone Negative Forced to use Google chrome needs a stock webrowser so please include that in next system update 
Positive removable memory I want to love this phone but so far my experience has been horrible Ive been having issues with the sounds ringer and internet stability and Ive not had the phone for a month yet I understand that during production sometimes things just go wrong and this may be an isolated case But so far bad outweighs the good I am returning this phone for a replacement and hopefully my next experience will be better As far as value I believe the pricing of cellphone are totally ridiculous it is getting so cellular phones arent affordable anymore This is the most Ive ever spent on a cellphone and I will never do this again Much too expensive I loved my S5 and there really wasnt any need to upgrade However my wife thought it best and I must say that there is much to be gained from the advanced technology I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to the S7 It was a simple process with the enclosed device and the usb cable All of my contacts apps etc were transferred to the new phone It took about a half an hour I love the memory expansion slot the clock which is always on and the fingerprint security feature I couldnt be more happy with it Not to mention the water resistance The instant on camera is another great feature I am very glad that Ive decided the right phone device Samsung combined what was great about the S5 and what was great about the S6 edge plus and made it even better The fast wireless charging is super convenient while the one handed operation options if fantastic for those who want the big phone but have small hands The always on display and night clock are great because they are actually saving me power from constantly checking the time I used to have an iPhone 6 and this phone is so far beyond in terms of technology I also loved the USB adapter that came in the box because the one thing that I dreaded about leaving behind my iPhone was loosing my music but with this new tool and samsung switch I was able to import all of my iTunes library into Google music Everything works very well Excellent camera
I wish it was easierfaster to move apps to the sd card but that is it This phone is perfect in every way Its fast powerful has lots of features and its visually appealing Its amazing This phone its awesome the resolution and the themes and tha cam definetly I loved This has been the best phone so far Its a must have Everything works and looks great I have to say that this is probably my 8th Samsung phone and they never stop impressing me Flawless fast sharp looking great battery life Keep it up Samsung 
Costumer 4 life Phone works great with normal functions Good phone overall However it overheats at simple tasks like getting directions and charging It can be slow at weird times There are random ads that pop up when you turn on your phone from Google play and on the internet and I cant figure out how to get rid of them Front camera takes a second to load and if you want to take a picture quickly it will be too dark It is heavier than the S4 but not a lot bigger These problem are pretty minor though and I like the phone as Ive been using it so far Theres a lot of features I have yet to discover and I hope that I find them really useful because Ive liked the ones Ive seen so far I love the speedthe lookthe HD the game play everything is off the charts I wish I could say more about it but Ive only had it for a few days now  hope this will help you decide between other devices Love it The look the weight the clarity all of it Love the way it looks Screen display and pictures are so clear Its a great phoneits easy to operate and i will continue to suggest it to people every day Switched from iPhone Never going back Silky smooth performance that cant be matched I thought the S7 was going to be a little bigger like a 6 but other than that the S7 is great It seems like the screen is always lagging out and its always tell me I have no Internet connection when Im at home and my husband is connected to the WiFi and Im not If Im at work and I have 4glte coverage I cant connect to the Internet always It is an extreme bug and its slowly turned me against this phone Overall A meets highest expectations
Light weight good price I just upgraded from a Samsung s4 to the s7 I love my new phone It has a very good camera and new software for you to use The battery life is excellent You cannot go wrong with the s7 Love the design battery life features and the fact that you can insert an SD card Havent tried it yet but the fact that it is water resistant is very awesome Ive had this phone for a month and a half and have had no issues at all Fantastic in every respect Smooth operator long lasting battery fabulous photos and the best looking smartphone ever Best cellphone yet Love the edge features and battery life This phone is really great First samsung owned battery last 2 days with heavy use resolution is amazing cameras are amazing I love this phone 10 of 10 for me We decide to buy a new one we love it its awesome Im liking this phone Only issue Im having is the battery drains fast Not sure what is causing it yet Ive owned the Galaxy S3 and S5 so I was excited when the 7 came out 

They made a few changes that I do not like They changed up the phone and contact set up and uses which I hate They also added more builtin apps that are annoying the heck out of me because they keep popping up and giving me phone warnings that mean nothing The speaker also stinks because it vibrates Dont know if its just mine In the 2 weeks Ive owned it Ive had to soft boot 3 times It seems to be because Im running an app while its wirelessly charging not for sure though 

Im very happy because it came with more storage as well as external storage is backyay

Overall I expected the 7 to be even better but I do not think it is at all This is an upgrade from S5 Overall performance is greatexcept when it moves off of my micro tower to the nearest cell tower I wish this would be much faster though I plan for it when leaving the house Battery life is good but could always be better and I have only ran it low 1x on purpose Now for my rantwhy did you leave off the IR Blaster SAMSUNG I WANT A IR BLASTER The IR Blaster is a great tool as was the tool box Overall better than the iphone but others maybe getting close to the Galaxy S7 I feel the S7 has the perfect size and is very quick Now if Samsung had included the IR Blaster it would give it 48 out of 50 as it sets 43 Yes I use the IR Blaster allot on my S5 Went from the galaxy s6 edge love it wish they had more cases Camera should have screen touch capture My young children and babies take selfesteem by just touching screen but this phone does not have that option Should be able to use both cameras simultaneously We love the large screen but hd would be nice All my videos I share are blurry for the people receiving them Facebook is the only to share to keep them clear Pros Battery lift great processing power great Samsung pay is great multi tasking abilities are excellent very happy that removable micro sd memory card is present in S7skipped S6 phone because of that extreme water resistants is great

Cons missing IR blaster from my S5 missing mhl support also that S5 had wish voice snooze that S4 had would return to future galaxy phones The only issue I have is accessing Galaxy when I try talking to it andor give a command I originally started with the Samsung family with a Galxy S2 Since then I have had the pleasure of owning the S5 S6 and as of now the S7 I absolutely love this product It has delivered everything Samsung promised it would This is a great phone with great features that anyone can fall in love with Thank you I am very happy with this phone and all its great features The camera is amazing I bragged so much about this phone to a friend he went and got one for himself This is a great device A lot of really nice features My wife and I each got one and we both really like them we are on them all of the time There are so many great things about this phone from the waterproof design to the gorgeous screen I could go on and onbut lets cut to the chase

Whatever is causing the wifibluetooth issues is annoying  one shouldnt have to turn off the other to make them work Touchwiz continues to be unnecessary and the bloatware is annoying

This is one of the best phones out there hands downbeats my old iPhone 6 plus Some faster software updates might just solve this little bugs Overall the new galaxy s7 is suberb in every single way Love it the camera is great battery life is a plus too Upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and love the phone so far Some great and neat featuresThe only disappointment is losing the IR blaster from the S4 so the phone can no longer be a remote control Good cellphone I will recommended to all my family and friends Great batterywater resistant and dust proof Edge screen is fun to look at I find most all applications work great on this phone I love my new phone so much cool features And cant wait to get my VR gear in the mail I love the size and feel of this phone It definitely has great features The wireless charging feature is great I dont like the Samsung bloat ware but overall I really like the phone I havent learned the total use of the phone yet but I love it This was a great purchase for me I love the memory and the extended memory capability The camera is a jewel and the features are something to be desired I love the samsung galaxy S7 The phone is great you can get extra storage up 200 gigs but the battery life is not what you think I love the camera It takes excellent pictures in low light conditions for a phone I dont feel the need to also carry my camera The one thing I dont like is Im not able to use a blue light filter app on my new phone It creates issues with most other functions Not the case with my 5 I have enjoyed the Galaxy line since the SII and just recently retired my S5 for the S7 Im continuously impressed by Samsungs devotion to adding and enhancing the features and apps of the Galaxy line The S7 is everything I expected and more

I especially like that the S7 is a bit narrower than the S5 and that it is more water resistant with its enclosed battery Im thrilled to have the beveled glass again as the S5 did not have it It feels silky smooth and stronger The 200 Gig MicroSD expandable memory is awesome and the speaker on the S7 is a huge improvement over the S5 Locating it on the bottom rather than the back of the device increased its overall volume and sound quality One feature I find particularly helpful is the ability to set safe zones to keep the device unlocked while Im in a designated safe place

Thank you Devs for your superior attention to detail  you rock The galaxy s7 is awesome I would definitely recommend it Love my Samsung will never have anything else Way better than the iPhone Fast functional and great battery life Best phone Ive ever seen POOR  NOT WORKING  LOWEST BRAND  THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE WIHT SAMSUNG TV  AVERAGE 10  I like everything on the phone I would reccomemd it to anybody that has a phone Galaxy is the best I love my Galaxy S7 and I love all Samsung products could use a removable battery but over all a great phone always loved galaxiesI owned a G4 before and you coundnt beat that camera but this one comes close not really any complaints other than not be able to remove battery I love it Im very happy with everything about this phoneit was a great choice Everything I expected from Samsung and more Great amount of storage Looks great I am really impressed with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge it is action packed and is beyond feature packed Extremely satisfied with my new S7 Edge I love the smart features color display and battery life I have owned every Samsung phone made and I will tell you how pleased I am with this one over any other Samsung or any other phone period I could have not asked for a better phone Keep up the great work team Samsung I love everything about this phone Every time I turn around I find new features like the Samsung smart home the gear s2 has its own phone thats awesome and the gear vr is insane I dont wanna ever take them off This is a very good product runs very smoothly the only thing I would change is the fact that you cant change the battery as mine is already starting to drain more quickly I love that they brought back the extra storage slot The speakers on this phone is amazing Makes listening to music an enjoyable experience Watching videos on this phone is great Very clear crisp picture and great audio quality Taking pictures is easy and good quality I went from the G5 to G7 and oh boy what a great phone Fast downloads and live streaming Very impressed with this product I love this phone it better then the s6 my friends buying them one we love glaxazy phones The issues are more with the phone than Verizon The person that helped me activate my phone was great The problem I have is with the phone It is supposed to have a great battery life but on a good day it about par with all the other phones I love my smasung galaxy s7 it is water resistant so now i can bring it with me in the shower without worrying about it getting damaged I also bought a 64gb micro sd card and added it to my phone because it has expendable memory so i dont care abour wasting my gb I have no problems not one with this phone the water proof is very true I say this phone is better than the iPhone by far great features 1 phone on the market camera is the best too Great for games good battery life cool samsung apps Product makes calls through WiFi screen is bright fast and seamless Internet interactions This product has a great camera video sound and features on it easy to use connect well with computer Back from iPhone love my Galaxy7 So fun personalizing I bought this phone as an upgrade and its a huge difference from my old phone Its extremely fast and I havent had to restart it all the time like my old phone Friends and coworkers are very envious of it and all want one of their own some even use iPhones I am impressed with the battery life of this phone it lasts all day with average use If youre looking for a great phone to upgrade to this is the one Since I have gotten several Samsung products I love them Great apps and features Updated from Galaxy S3 and love this phone Fast Clear viewing even in sunlight Great pictures Upgraded from a S5 and I love this Fingerprint is much better Also like the always on I had the Galaxy S5 before this but I am more than pleased with my upgrade The s7 Edge has a much better screen and it even seems to run a bit faster as well I have nothing to complain about this product All i can say samsung for the best The phone has a great feel in your hand the display is excellent The edge feature is great for doing quick things I upgraded to the S7 from S6 because I didnt want to have to deal with the device overheating while using Gear VR I havent had any overheating issues with the S7 at all I wish the microsd storage could have been bigger Given 512GB microsd is out on the market Id love to have used that in my phone TypeC USB would have been a big bonus as well The 240 FPS slomo capture is amazing I was able to see a lot more of my problems with my golf swings as compared to the 120 FPS on S6

Overall I have been generally really happy with Samsung products except for that Galaxy NotePro 122 screen flicker issue Higher quality build materials SD card mount waterproofing and a lack of bloatware loaded onto this phone make it easily the most usable Samsung phone Ive had I bounce back and forth between iPhone and Android and this has been the only phone with the potential to convince me to stick to the Android side Its a great quality for the latest galaxy I skipped from the 5 to the 7 and its about the same Better visually The only thing is the camera I have had to get it fixed twice now Went from s5 to the s7 edge What an incredible experience I am still finding cool new features it has Definitely will keep my edge and recommend to my friends and family So far the S7 has been the best phone I have used yet I fell inlove with Galaxy with the S3 It was the S5 that really put me on the bandwagon And now the S7 Its extra rugged build and solid feel really puts this phone on the top of the durability charts The OS is great and fast and I really enjoy a lot of the new features But of course lets not forget the waterproof design and gorilla glass screen I love Samsung phones I am on my 4th one with the Galaxy S7 Edge and it is by far the best one Very easy to use
Fantastic battery
Amazing camera The galaxy s7 edge is by far the greatest phone Ive owned so far I upgraded recently from owning a galaxy note 4 and honestly my note 4 may have worked 60 of the time The S7 just works Flawlessly I have not yet had any issues with it The phone looks feels and performs as a phone should Being able to use samsung pay is a game changer I have only encountered one place where it didnt work and that was walmart I think that may have something to do with my card though It had worked everywhere else even vending machines Really love this phone I am a total Samsung fan in everything from phones to appliances The S7 doesnt disappoint The durability is awesome and the features unlimited I may never use them all but the ones that I do use are easy and reliable The battery life is amazing and dual screen rocks Havent had to find out if its as water resistant as they advertise but knowing me its only a matter if time This is just an amazing phone with the edge design and features The split screen is an amazing feature and very cool I like to be able to record game play for my YouTube channel This phone feels like a iPhone 6 but has all the features of a galaxy This is bye far the best phone out right now Most features work intuitively It would be much better if the phone can be used with voice command when paired in car via blue tooth I just bought this a few days ago and I am impressed with the capabilites of the functionality of the phone I must say I have had a few samsung phones and devices Never had any complaints and they most certainly will not start now Normally I have seen a good amount of bloatware being on Verizon and this being a Samsung phone I was pleasantly shocked to see only two items of bloatware and both from Verizon My friend and I got the phone at the same time We both also got the GearVR and are amazed by how much we can do The screens have such high pixel density that we found a dead pixel on his and could not see it until we used the VR headsets The phone is so good even defects can be drowned out Even getting his replaced was a breeze I remember having to deal with Samsung in the past however the customer support has improved also So we have a good company providing a great phone that keeps getting better How can other companies compete when one of the best just keeps getting better I just love the quality and features of the phone and gear watch I do many hobbys such as bmx racing and snowmobiling I like to carry my phone incase I need it and with these sports other phones will and have been easily destroyed I like the phone for its size customization and features The water resistant is really nice but the phones build quality is amazing I always get a glass screen protector just in case but I have never managed to crack or damage the phone in any way The battery life on this plus the camera features makes this one of best phones on the markets I live that Samsung gave us back the SD card even though I dont use one and the water resistance is a huge deal for me Cant wait to see what will come out next The only complaint I have may not even be Samsung fault There needs to be more phone cases for this phone 
I absolutely love the phone The features are amazing and the phone is durable and beautiful 
I have several Samsung products and have always been very impressed with all of them
Currently I own
S2 tablet
Tab pro
65 inch HD TV
4 Samsung smart phones
I love Samsung and will only buy their electronic products The edge portion is the only hangup on this phone as you can easily touch things you didnt mean to and also if you have your hand around the phone the wrong way and attempt to type you may not be able to until you release your grip of the phone a little bit or reposition it This can be easily remedied with a cheap plastic bumper case that adds drip to the sides and isnt bulky like a full real case Best money spent I love everything about it Beyond compare I like the speed the phone will work at  Doing multiple things at once is easy  This is one of the best looking phones Ive ever owned and operating is so smooth I also bought the Samsung VR to pair with this phone and it is magnificent and completley revolutionary  Ive even convinced several of my friends to switch from iPhone to Samsung which is a great leap but leap well worth it wow this phone is awesome

I love everything about it 

battery life and functions are the best theyve ever been Awesome phone I enjoy everything about it Glad I got this Previous phone had a disapointing camera in low light situations This phone takes great pictures in low light venues Love this phone Fast excellent audio quality and features are great Nice job Samsung This phone stays charged for a long time I had the S4 before this one and I am glad I got the S7 now At first was strange because I had to find everything but it didnt take long to learn it It seems to be very helpful and lots of features I didnt know I needed Also 32G is very large and is not easily filled up I think the phone is very good and I like it very much I would recommend getting an S7 for sure Great phone love it if would recommend this phone to anybody nicenice nice phone is really very fast and easy to use Have the perfect tools with great memory But need more perfomance betwee both memories Still trying to learn the new features but i am in love with my Sansung Galaxy S7 Performs flawlessly and exceeds my expectations I upgaded from an S5 This phone is really fast and I love the double tap home button that brings up the camera The camera being one of my favorite features The quality of dim lighting pictures has shocked and awed my friends I will definitely be looking forward to new features I have yet to discover My third Samsung phone The is the best so far Would recommend this to my friends I love the phone Its fast user friendly and waterproof What more could you want in a phone Ive only had this phone for a couple of weeks now and Im still getting use to it My previous phone was an android but not a Samsung Copying over my old data was a snap although it missed a few contacts The phone is sleek and light along with tons of features I still prefer the feel of my old phone in my hand I also think that the battery on my old phone or the power saving capabilities were better Im also getting use to the edge feature and find that sometimes when I cradle my phone in my hand that I inadvertently touch the screen with the inside of my hand Maybe I need to reduce the screen sensitivity I know that I started this review off with listing a number of annoyances but there are a lot of good features too The display and the camera are amazing I havent taken much advantage of using the edge display but I like the concept and will start using it more Its the thinnest phone that Ive ever had and lightest phone that Ive had in a long time I do a lot of hiking and skiing and appreciate the waterproof capabilities not just for the rain or snow but the sweaty pockets and misty weather in the PNW I havent used the heartrate monitor much I prefer to track continuous heart rate when I hike or exercise rather than take snapshots but the shealth app keeps track of steps for me I have a gps tracking app for my hikes and the screen makes it easy to check the map Im hoping to hang on to this phone for a number of years I bought this phone on the advice of the ATT salesman and he did not disappoint I like the feel of it the look of it and the way it performs I would definitely recommend this phone to a friend Overall this is a nice phone Camera is fantastic screen resolution is outstanding and Im able to delete or at least turn off many of the builtin apps that I dont use However there is one critical flaw the antenna is significantly subpar This is the primary function of the phone to make and receive phone calls I have not changed providers moved residences changed jobs or changed my daily commute tofrom work Yet the reception I receive from this phone compared to my previous LGG2 phone is way below impressive I have significant issues with reception in my home office where I never did and neither does my wife on her Iphone 5 before the Samsung S7 Also the phone is super slippery for handling Great phone but I dont like that the battery is fixed and I cant add storage Yes yes I understand all about the cloud but I dont always have WiFi etc I like the over all product  Havent had any issues with it What a great upgrade super fast and unbelievable camera My wife and I received our Samsung 7 Edges two weeks ago and we can not put them down We upgrade from our Samsung 5 Active to the new Samsung 7 Edges because the new features that Samsung has provided in this great phone I went with a Samsung watch that was being offered I now have a Dick Tracy watch that I can recieved phone call on I have been sold on Samsung products since buying a Samsung TV years ago My wife and I can not put our phones down These phones are the best investment we made this year Upgraded from galaxy s5 Many new features but very easy to use This phone is by far the best that I have had the pleasure of using The size may be off putting to some initially but with the display scaling feature and the ability to resize the keyboard this issue quickly fades away The display is also stunning 4k videos look absolutely great on this phone A little too small for my taste and a little hard to handle with the dual edge The single edge design was better in my view A lot of accidental screen touches occur and when trying to open up an app near the edge you often get the edge tab to open instead causing frustration When the security update came down shortly after purchase it caused my wifi to quit working costing me extra data until I eventually had to do a hard reset after talking to ATT support and Samsung support which was an extra pain since I had just installed everything and had just got going It fixed the problem initially but started to fail again so I reset network settings and that did the trick for now Well see Having owned previous Samsung phones I have never been dissatisfied S3 s5 and now the s7 
If you enjoy taking photos the new features are great for low light settings I also love the fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone and any apps that you want to Upgraded from the Galaxy s5 to the s7 and i would have to say it was the best move i can do It has such a beautiful display and the volume sounds amazing Battery life has improved alot i would recommend this phone for everyone This is the greatest phone ever made In my opinion great display and best features out there This new S7 is so user friendly and easy to use I cant believe I was still using that old S4 There so many new features and everything responds so well I love it I have had the phone for 3 weeks now and amazed how fast and enhanced the phone is Very happy with my purchase I enjoy traveling and I take lots of pictures Ive been able to take some fabulous photos with my new phonecamera Liking my S7 after about 1 month Like the wireless charging Themes and feel Since Im not allowed to mention any info about other companies Im just going say I was frustrated tired and just plain bored with the phones that a company that shares its name with a certain fruit has been providing I wanted a change and I wanted to be able to make changes which the fruit company would never ever allow Just the little things like changing themes and fonts and colors was so liberating I loved it right from the start

The reason I put only four stars in performance is because when I play certain games I notice a bit of lag and hesitation It doesnt last the whole time just the first part of the game  less than a minute Just something I notice every time though

So if you are one of those people that are thinking of making the change to something new innovative and actually customizable then I say DO IT Ive owned many different kinds of phones and this S7 Edge is by far the best performing and most attractive phone Ive ever owned Its like Samsung took the galaxy series and introduced it to steroids Somewhat upset that I switched from my Galaxy 5 to the Galaxy 7 It was supposed to be faster and have all these extra features The wifi doesnt work well at my home when someone calls me in my office I can hear them but they cant hear me and the battery life is awful I take it off the charger it has been charging all night and it already goes to 99 By the end of the day it goes all the way down to 19 etc My other phone didnt do anything of the above I had a Samsung 5 the battery was starting to drain too fast and memory getting low was not happy with picture quality so decided to go trade in and upgrade THINKING I would try another brand of phone I went with the heavily touted spectacular battery life of the DROID TURBO 2 HUGE disappointment  the battery was dead by the end of the day even though advised 48 hours of use the features that SAMSUNG had this DROID had none I guess the grass is not greener I had to find out myself I guess after 7days of trying to like the DROID and went straight in and grabbed the SAMSUNG GLAXY 7 EDGE BEST choice ever oh how I missed the great features and extras the picture quality was improved and spectacular the battery even lasted way longer than then advertised everything about the S7 is well worth the trade up I am not happy with the price its rather high but I dug out my wallet and paid no eating for a few weeks but hey I have the best phone on the market Impressed with camera like the quick access to camera and quick focus The phone is awesome Easy to use fast and reliable Best samsung phone I have had yet Edges are so handy The battery life is great last me all day with being on my phone a good amount The extra SD card slot is what makes the phone it helps put a lot more stuff with out overwhelming the phonesystem memory Have had lots of android phones most all in the last ten years have been Samsung But this is hands down the best love the edge for quick access to apps and more Mine is paired with the gear2 watch what a get combo The swipe keyboard is my favorite thing of all Just how slick it is the memory card is a big thing with me because I like to download a lot of music the picture of the screen and beautiful like Im watching my HDTV Everything you need in a phone Water resistant amazing camera etc Love my new phone very sleek I love how it sets up your apps in the phone for an organized person this is great that you can shuffle the apps from az As a Veteran who has loss most of my hearing I rely heavy on the vibration mode of the phone to inform me of incoming text and calls This phone has vibrations but in normal use you can not feel it I get more movement out of the speakers than the phone Not a good buy for hearing impaired The typed voice message is supper cool I guess you cant have anything With the new Galaxy S7 I can see the world in a whole new light literally The new camera features allow me to capture perfect photos in lighting other phones can only dream about Finally a phone with a camera that sees what I see I just replaced my HTC One with the Samsung Galaxy S7 I feel like I got a new pair of glassesthats how crisp the screen is on this phone I know that the battery in a new phone will last longer at first but this seems to be much better than I ever expected

Photos are of a very high quality and the shutter is quick Audio clarity is excellent

Highly recommend this phone I was happy to get my new phone after having broken my other one trying to get it out of the case I did buy a case for this one The reason I did is because this phone is sleek and I was afraid it might slip out of my hands Im not sure I would go with the Edge again only because its hard to protect The camera is super sharp I really enjoy that The clarity is so good I am in awe The Internet is fast and goes from my email to the Internet in no time I can switch from one site to another without any drag time I did add a micro sd card for photos I did figure out that after some searching with getting it to do its job that sort of thing Once I got everything set up now I just enjoy it It is lightweight and the display is adjustable very bright to dimmer Edge is easy to use and lightweight Know featureso from previous models but I am learning more and more with the new Edge I miss my S5mostly because of the battery I could swap it out I was mislead to think I might make it through the day without a charge No way Had to buy the GearS2 as a back up Together I can get into the evening Very disappointed with the battery life 

Love the other features in order of importance for me wireless charging doesnt charge as quickly as the S5 with the qi adapter expandable memory water resistance nice improvement eliminating the port cover nice improvement with the flattening if the camera lens over the S6 camera features are excellent and the size and weight are nice

Someday Samsung will get the battery life right They are almost there Best phone ive had thus far Although its a huge jump from the S4 to S7 I am very impressed with the performance of the phone I already accidentally ran it over and left in rain and is in perfect condionthe size is perfect and go performance I use this phone for everything from playing games to creating powerpoints and managing network infrastructure this phone holds up with no issues It has yet to freeze or even lag for me The adaptive display is also great for different lighting This is an altogether great phone and I would definately reccommend it This phone looks good its light weight and perfect for an all around phone Camera is really good too Like how it has the fingerprint to log into phone and into certain apps The phone hold some very nice features that are simply cool to have Like a full charge in one hour Thats awesome Im in love with my new samsung galaxy s7 great quality Double tapping the home key to access the camera is brilliant The speed at which the camera comes on is very impressive as well I love taking pictures of my german shepherd and as any dog owner will tell you getting a good picture can mean having your camera going and ready for the good opportunity Not with the S7 Within 2 seconds im ready to get her cocking her head just right or to catch a good shot of her chasing a squirrel Using the slowmotion feature is amazing also I love this phone and was taking pictures like a savage before now i feel like a civilzed person that can share a quality picture everytime This phone is amazing I have not found anything that this phone cant do Ive only had my new Samsung phone for 2 weeks but Im very happy with it 

Its fast  responsive  has lots of features that I appreciate I like the new slim casing and glass cover that protect the phone without bulking it up I also like the fact that the phone is water resistant can be set up to respond to my fingerprint for unlocking it  displays the time  power level even when the home screen is shut down I purchased the inductive quick charging system which has a sleek design  is easy to use

 Im still learning about the phone  there are some issues with my emails loading with images as well as not always knowing how to use or access some features I know its a powerful computer  I look forward to exploring all the things that its capable of doing The Galaxy S7 Edge is easily the finest smartphone that Ive ever owned Its powerful functionally intuitive and its just darn sexy it even feels good in your hand 
 It earns 5 stars with me in each category except for the 4 stars I gave it for performance and that is based solely on battery performance which although is solid is not as strong as my previous experience with the Droid Maxx 
In summary SAMSUNGs Galaxy S7 Edge is an incredibly capable aesthetically beautiful phone inside  out I love this phone Perfect size and the camera is absolutely the best out there Need I say more Samsung products are awesome I love this phone its exceptionally fast and is very easy to use The only thing I would change is to have more battery time I use this phone for everything Corporate email calendar and my Camera just to name a few I have a one year old and this is the best camera Ive ever used on a phone As a busy career woman and mom I definitely recommend the S7 Nice screen it had it all Battery life is great Great graphics Great sound still learning the phone but the more I mess with it the more features I find Following I like about S7
 Expandable storage 
 Integration with gear S2 seamless 
 Display 
 Loving Samsung Pay Im still learnin g all the things that this hand held powerhouse can do for me Love the look speed and user friendliness The camera is  WOW Every Samsung product I have ever owned has been great and the Galaxy 7 edge is no exception The screen is larger since it goes the entire width of the phone It does take some getting used to tough The screen response when you touch the sides which can cause some frustrations but nothing too major I love the phone Took me a day or so to figure it out and it was funny about adding people to my contacts but otherwise is good Wireless doesnt seem to connect to the network as quickly even when its saved on the phone Requires me to restart it The voice mail icon stays on and you have to go thru extra steps to get it off Great phone Battery life last a long time Very easy to use Only thing i dont like is the s voice has a hard time working Could be the otterbox tho I love this phone The camera is great It takes beautiful clear photos  the reverse camera with the flash is a great feature The only issue I have is with the connectivity if the Bluetooth is on the wifi has a lag  does not connect Also when typing in Web addresses they do not load the first time you have to back out and reload The glass breaks easily I only had mine 8 days and it cracked on the edge People should switch from other night brand name phone to Samsung Galaxy I love it so very much I used to have and owned other Samsung products in the past but nothing compared to this phone right now Love every minute of it Love the features the fast fingerprint scanner the image quality is immaculate I love this phone so much Best one yet Galaxy is the best at everything The new Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is absolutely the greatest device currently on the market today A simply stunning and elegant design With a beautiful high resolution front and rear facing camera you can capture all of lifes best moments in just seconds It features an extremely powerful processor to handle any and every task with ease A new water and dust resistant design to keep youre phone protected for the unexpected everyday obstacles and lots of new and improved features to make life even easier Charging youre phone has never been faster And with the improved power saving mode battery life is simply incredible I would strongly recommend is phone to everyone and Im sure they would be greatly satisfied I definitely look forward to seeing more products from Samsung in the near future Camera takes great pictures and I like the ease of double clicking to take a picture Also you can see the picture instantly and take another if you dont like the first one Color and clarity are great Better than my regular camera and easy to send pictures to my friends I love what Samsung has done I loved my S6 but the S7 just fixes all the small issues from the S6 and then goes on to make small tweaks with big effefts As an added bonus the Lifeproof Case for the S7 also fixes the issues the S6 Case had and also does a great job of upgrading the look and feel of the case All around this device is a must buy if you have an S6 I love my Samsung S7 I have the Titanium silver model It has great features and improvements that I was looking for in this model They improved on the battery as well as improvements on the camera in low lighting I love the quick responsiveness of the phone I could go on and on about this phone and how great it is you have to try it for yourself Samsung has yet to let me down I love the speed of the phone It is also the first cell phone that I have owned that I can actually hear on the phone with out some staticy background sound

Cons they took out some setting options on the calander 

The phone also died after about 2 weeks I got a black screeen and could not get it to work Went on line and found that this is a common problem with this phone Hopefully Samsung can fix this There is a way to get it working again but I dont want to have to be doing this particularly if it dies during a phone call which apparently has happened to some people

I prefer the size of my S4 Overall I think this is another great product from Samsung however I think the new software Android 601 has some bugs that need to be fixed I have faith that Samsung will remedy that in short time

Until the software issues are fixed I give it a 95 out of 10 I have graduated from a S5 to an S7 Edge I couldnt be happier Samsung is so dependable The dual edge design looks amazing and provide a lot of neat features The dual edge design also makes it very hard for a case to do an adequate job of protecting the screen I have a case that it raised on the top and bottom to help prevent the screen from hitting the ground it dropped I dropped my phone one time and a tiny rock on the ground cracked my screen 
Overall the phone is great Just be really careful to not drop it This is the best phone Samsung has ever made and its a game changer I own 4 of these and have been a Samsung user for a long time  Its a gorgeous piece and an amazing performer allaround is just one of the hottest phones if not the hottest phone of 2016  way to go Samsung I will admit that Im a heavy user I clock a lot of screen time So when I heard the battery was going to be a huge upgrade from previous generations and the competition I was very excited Now that Im using my S7 Edge for a few weeks Im not upset just disappointed Im charging my S7 Edge 2 or 3 times a day but fast charging cuts down on the irritation Ive also noticed a stutter a few times slight freezing and thats irritating Ive been very careful with my S7 Edge but I noticed yesterday a small 1 centimeter scratch on the screen I have no how it got there and that makes me very sad 

With all that said now let me tell u how great this phone is My favorite aspect of the phone is how great it feels in the hand I love rolling it over in my palm and running my fingers across the screen My second favorite thing would be the look I have the silver S7 Edge and the way the light reflects is beautiful and minimum bezelscurved screen sets the phone apart from the competition The phone is quick and intuitive One great thing about this phone is that its future proof With water resistance removable SD card 4k video this phone is ready for tomorrow Not having a laptop or desktop to transfer files to when Im out of space was a huge problem until now Now all I do it pop in a new SD card and Im set I never have to delete anything again The screen is beautiful and the camera is very nice The camera is super quick and the speaker is pretty descent With fast wireless charging I will never have the charging port go bad and that means one less thing to have to worry about Ive had my charging port go bad on my previous phone twice it wasnt a samsung phone that problem wont happen with my S7 Edge In addition the GEAR VR is just the cherry on top This phone is highly customizable so it will fit anyones taste My s7 edge is my primary computer a computer that makes phone calls so yeah its a phone but I think I made the best choice for my needs 

If samsung can fix the rare stutterfreeze and find a way to power a phone for all day heavy use and increase the strength of the glass then samsung will have made the perfect handheld computersmart phone I do and I have recommended the galaxy s7 edge to my friends and family I really like my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge This is the second time Ive switched from an iPhone to Samsung and I love it I have had almost every phone that Samsung has made The galaxy s7 edge is the best phone I have ever owned It is quick and has a great camera also the fact that it is water proof is amazing As a hole I like my new phone I wish it would have transferred all setting over from my old phone Also I wish it would have came with a wireless charger I have been doing a lot of research on those and they have mixed reviews I feel if it had came with the phone I would felt better about havinggetting one Also I believe it would be beneficial to have put a screen protector on from the factory Also the search in settings is not very good I do not want this review to be viewed as bad as I believe the product to be good but I believe there is room for improvement Bought the s7Edge for the larger battery but found with the fast charge battery life is never an issue anyways Best cell phone ive ever owned Not the biggest user of the edge feature the battery does good but still charge once a day my galaxy s 5 needed charge every other day love the finger print password I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge about 2 weeks ago Its an even better device than I could have ever imagined It has a blazing fast processor with enough RAM to multitask with ease The voice clarity is so good that it sounds like your standing right next to the person having the conversation face to face At first I wasnt used to having the edge feature so I didnt use it much I made it a point to start utilizing the edge feature more since its the key feature for which the phone is marketed And now that Im used to the edge I absolutely love it and use it all the time It makes calling or sending texts to your favorite contacts such a breeze and you can also select which edge features you want to show up when you swipe it from contacts to news to the flashlight or compass The only thing I was even remotely disappointed with at first was the battery life But somehow over the past 2 weeks the battery life seems to have improved moderately as if the phone somehow adapted to my usage style So now the battery usually lasts all day and then some and thats with Bluetooth location  WiFi turned on all day all the time There are of course heavy usage days where the phone needs to be charged towards the end but thats understandable Couldnt imagine a much better phone than this Now the question is what new features are they going to introduce on the S8 S9 and so on What else is there that a phone can do Im sure Samsung will think of something and I cant wait to see what that something is This phone is just what I was looking forfast waterproof love everything about it
Samsung does it again great products This phone was definitely a step up the back camera doesnt stick out as much and I believe the heart monitor sensor does seem to be more accurate but could just be me Also the edges of the on the S7 curve toward the fram making the phone less slippery for you phone droppers Features of also include it to be water proof and a larger battery which is great for those consistently on the move As for the screen honestly I dont see very much of a difference I still see it one of greatest displays out there though QHD2560 x 1440 pixels What I found very useful and nice looking was a feature called AMOLED Which was the idol screen while your phone is off and allow to see timebattery life messages and calls Now the camera to keep this nice and short it does have lower Megapixels but dont doubt it yet it adapts extremely well to bright and low light very impressively Last but not least the phones overall performance Im not computer geek but I do enjoy technology and from its predecessor the S6 3 Gb RAM The S7 has 4Gb and seeing multiple bench mark tests the S7 is much faster Takes great pictures just love it slim design fits right in my purse Like the title states this is a really good Phone The battery life is solid call quality and signal are solid and the TouchWiz overlay is much improved Ive been burnt out and havent gotten excited about a phone in a long time but this phone has made it fun again The only draw back is Im afraid not to use a case but thats a small problem The features of the phone are perfect I love the quality of the running system The new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is an amazing phone Love its form and functionality The batteryear life is pretty amazing for such a thin phone The phone has way to many 3rd party popups As you surf the internet youtube and so forth its a popup every 5 seconds Its very annoying and im thinking about switching out I purchased this as a replacement for the OnePlus 2 phone I was unsure that about the purchase because I loved my old phone but wanted a device that was more universal than the OnePlus I was extremely pleased with the phone and its features It was easy to set up and use and it has made me totally forget about that other phone I had  

Love it I really enjoy all the features screen size resolution I especially like the return of expandable memory and the addition of water resistance and improved low light camera Impressive redesign with expandable micro SD memory which was missed in prior phone Wish Samsung would not allow carrier to add bloatware and remove settings that are included in unlocked phone Love the builtin wireless charging which works great and addition of being waterproof Impressive redesign with expandable micro SD memory which was missed in prior phone Wish Samsung would not allow carrier to add bloatware and remove settings that are included in unlocked phone Love the builtin wireless charging which works great and addition of being waterproof I really enjoy everything the phone can do The camera is awesome and I feel like I can connect super easy I have been using my phone without a case and it is pretty slippery and with such a large screen I find myself clicking on things I didnt want I think a case might help with that but I enjoy how thin the phone is I like edge screen and think it is 100 worth it I really like this phone Wasnt sure about switching from s6 active to this phone but glad I did Its smaller and fits in my hand Although I do miss the active button But love having the expandable storage back and water resistance Battery is ok wish it was better but doesnt everyone Love it so far its my 4th Samsung phone Love the speed and performance It allows you to hold with full control when holding the phone This phone is everything the s6 wasnt and with the sd card slot it makes it the best phone on the market Great product I enjoy its durability and usability All the features are easy to configure The edge screens can be as simple or as complex as I want The performance is excellent and I have not had a problem with it slowing down often when processing Calls are clear and even my cheap blue tooth device works without any of the issues that I had on my old phone WiFi connects quickly and works well on high speed Access Points I use my phone for web searches and checking Email a good amount of time during the day and the battery has been holding up very well I really like the wireless charging option it is very convenient and its just cool because in the dark it is so much easier to place it on the charger instead of having to search for the cable on my nightstand 

Only issue is that it really needs to have a case to make it easier to handle The fear of the edge screen caused me to drop it a couple of times but a case solved that problem The best device i have ever used I would suggest to decrease the App icon grid size and I experienced a disturbance in the volume when its to the maximum would be phenomenal if it would be cris The s7 edge is the second Samsung that I have owned I love the features that is has such as the split screen It is also nice to have a waterproof device as water is always a concern I do not see myself purchasing a different brand as Samsung always seems to be on the cutting edge GREAT camera also After reading reviews about the s7 i decided to switch I have no regrets The biggest thing for me is that I am able to add more storage The S7 is a very solid phone It has lots of great features The only bad thing is the battery life but that is do to the massive amount of possessing power Since getting the phone I barely have to use my laptop any more the phone can handle it all I feel like its very similar to the s6 and i like that but the new fetures are everything the last phone was missing i love that its waterproof thats what really sold it for me the acreen is bigger and the battery life is better but i still think the battery life needs to be improved the design is nice and as always it has pretty cool fetures i do the the auto focus camera its cool to play around with i also like the desplay its very vlear and bright hopefully they will come up with some new fetures with the next phone but i do love this phone Only complaint I have is the volume buttons and the onoff switch Its hard to hold phone without pressing the buttons when you dont want to They need to be in a diffrent position or harder to pushCan be aggravating I love this phone its fast small and does everything I need it to do With the new screen and processor all your pics and vids look just as good as they do on your tv And with the new VR app why would you ever look and an Idevice again We always look for the latest gadgets we make sure they live up to our standards Without thinking as consumers we truly care about user experience and user interface we look for performance reliability and a product full of fetures that can be actually used in our daily lifes 
After owning many Samsung devices and electronics for many years I as an individual can say that my experience has been great with them and till today I still own and use 
The Galaxy S7 is no different is not a perfect phone but is definitely the best phone I have ever owned As a consumer I look for the flaws of a product first then the pros With that said there anot many cons on this phone but the ones that I found can be a little annoying from time to time
The edge screens a great innovative concept that comes in handy at many times during the day but it seems as if sometimes the responsiveness of the screen is not the best at times it has a hard time recognizing thumb touches
The design is beautiful and creates a great good impression but when turning the phone into land scape mode while watching a video I tend to cover the speaker I have been used to having the speaker on the back and not on the side This has become a little annoying since its hard to grab the phone in a different way
Cons in this phone are minimal pros over take and make for a better user experience The edge screens have help minimize the amount of icons and screens I have on my phone The phone is fully customizable and it comes with features that can actually be used like Samsung pay
The screen is beautiful videos and movies look amazing The phone is fast and virtually lag free Also having the ability to expand its storage with a mini sd card is a plus
The camera is one of the best features on this phone Not only images come out great at the finest resolution but the ability to control the cameras settings manually makes it even better
The galaxy S7 edge is definitely one of the best phones I ever had and if you are lookinh to switch your old phone or new Iphone for something better the S7 is the answer Have had the S5 before just upgraded to the S7 for my husband This phone so fare is taking the abuse that he give a phone with no problems I upgraded from an S3 and am in awe of the speed quality and performance The camera quality is commendable I am a big fan of the Samsung line of phones this is my 6third Galaxy phone Stunning resolution on the display amazing new features through the Android platform battery life is better than expected and the fingerprint lock feature actually works I never had luck with other phones Water resistant is awesome This phone has an amazing processor and is fast I have loved the Samsung phones for a long time now but this exceeds the expectations I continue to be impressed and excited by the features and performance of the S7 Because the performance improvement over the S4 is so dramatic I find myself using more features more frequently I am now using S Health everyday to monitor my diet exercise and cardiovascular state The food logging and vast catalog has revealed some interesting information about my diet
I cannot say enough about performance Email and Web browsing feel comparable to my desktop at work Battery life feels optimized and ultra powers saving mode definitely extends that last bit of power for hours The screen is fantastic bright and clear for my old eyes The camera is super fast and the video steady despite my shake your hands All around great phone Snappy speeds and powerful mobile processing makes this a great device for power users A full charge lasts all day with moderate to heavy use Many user friendly features A huge upgrade from the S5 I moved from iPhone to Galaxy S7 Edge I loved the design it feels very good in hand The display is magical and the camera takes super quick shots The battery life is great and Im using the edge screen options as well Overall the best smartphone that I have used until now Keep up the great work Samsung This phone is well designed and has outstanding performance I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone I am enjoying my S7 Edge I was concerned about the size and being able to use it with one hand but I appreciate that it offers keyboards that are smaller and adjustable I am having issues finding the settings feature in all of my apps but other than that it is running well The battery life is much longer than my previous S4 but it still gets down to 30 after a full days use I really appreciate the WiFi calling since I do not get great service at my office Overall a great phone and I am getting used to the size I am still looking for the right screen protector I switched from the Iphone 6 plus to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and was hopeful that it would meet my needs Sadly the battery life on this phone is awful I cant even make through one day without fear that I am going to reach the end of my power quotient I am very worried that I am going to be attached to the wall by the end of my 2 year obligation 

Also why did you put glass on the back of the phone Didnt you learn anything from the IPhone debacle Ive already irreparably harmed my phone and it was so innocous that I cant remember even dropping it

On a positive note I do like the size of the phone and the picture and functionality of the device are good At first glance this phone is in a league of its own Its sleek sexy look is appealing to all brands of cell users and the bigger battery promising for the heavy users However the performance life I have found this phone to have is subpar Perhaps it is a software issue being that it is a new phone but the promise of 16 hours of continual video playback has fallen far short From 100 I am lucky to get a full 8 hours out with moderate social media use Very disappointing for such a great phone Besides the battery life I have noticed that this phone has been quite slow on downloading and installing of applications It takes about as long to download as it does to install onto the device Seems to be a ton of systems and RAM running at all times Maybe that explains the battery life Im no expert on the inner parts of the phone I just use it and compare to past phones I like it would love it if it just lasted the day with me I had a samsung s4 and it broke when i dropped My fault I went to verizonto get a new phone and they said i can upgrade to new s7 I didnt know much about the phone After using and reading up on it ive come to love this phone Camera is great Easy to use and the resolution is amazing I absolutely love this phone The design is overall amazing The Galaxy S7 is beautiful but I would prefer to have the bottom buttons instead of the touch pad My palm will hit it accidentally and go back a page or open up the app manager without me wanting to Not yet sure the Edge feature is special but a GREAT phone non the less Absolutely love this phone and everything about it and wcweytging that it does The features and performance run well and are easy to find I have had a lot different phones over the years this is better than i expected i was worried about battery life and i am telling you it last all day with a lot of use Great phone I previously owned a Note3 and loved it Never thought Id use another Samsung other than the note but the features and sleekness of the S7 edge was too hard to pass up It has all the versatility that my Note3 had without the S pen of course with all new features and a brighter screen A in my book I had an S5 before this and my husband has always disliked Samsung phones but after I got my S7 he really wants one now I love every feature on this phone the finger print reader awwwwwesome the app to use your phone to pay so many features to mention its overall amazing It really cool to use lot of apps that I can use Lots of things I can use with smartphone that accept apps to work with Ive had the Galaxy S45 and 6 The Galaxy S7 edge is the best in the galaxy series My wife has an iPhone 6 and always asks to use the camera on my phone I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the S7 and have enjoyed the increased speed and look of the screen it seems to run so much smoother than the S5 I do miss not being able to change out to a spare battery but so far battery life has not been an issue I also miss the feel of the S5 back side it felt like it wouldnt slip out of my hand but even though the S7 feels slippery its actually not strange I know but it doesnt slip just feels like it although I am used to it now Very well pleased with this new phone Much faster than my S4 was and the larger screen makes it so much easier to see I also like the better battery life as well This cellphone has a great camera on both sides It also has a GREAT display Amazing phone Im happy I bought it but wish it was cheaper This phone has great apps and takes amazing pictures I love the sleek design and beautiful colors as well Overall Im very happy with my purchase The is the best Android phone I have ever owned the exact right size Best camera I have always owned a Nexus phone which I love but the S7 beats them all I had the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for about three weeks now and I love everything about it Love that i got this phone Great battery life features and very very durable

However there are some hicups with software but other than that great job samsung Few probs from the start date of getting Samsung S7 at ATT I should of done what everyone had told me and waited 3months until all the problems with a new phone always gives There were too many list The most bothersome was that I bought a top glass screen protector and then could not type on the phone unless I pressed down really hard I checked it out with the second phone ATT gave me and happened again Worth the money Great pictures Love all the stuff I can do with it This phone is absolutely incredible The display looks amazing even in sunlight Im not sure what can even be done in the future to improve this phone A It is usually easier to write a bad review than a good one In this case its close to impossible The Samsung Galaxy S7 is about as close to perfect as a device can get The camera alone makes it worth owning Samsung finally made the perfect mobile phone 
Adding the larger battery and SD card slot makes this the perfect phone 
Was able to increase phone memory to 128 gigs
If your looking for the best phone on the market you need look no further
Samsung has made the perfect phone  Feel as if I had more with my s5 ir blaster 16mp Been using the new phone for almost 2 weeks and have had 0 issues Its fast and so far has been a nice upgrade from my older s5 the Camera is super fast and clear much better than my old phone
minor complaints i have is the power button being a little lower and the slight curve of the phone and how the zagg glass screen protector doesnt bond well on the sides
other than that i would recommend the purchase of the phone if asked and im happy with my new phone The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is great cell phone with a wide set of options and features After a week I am still exploring and will be for some time I have a smart car ELR and the S7 Edge is an excellent accessory I bought my S7 a few days ago and I love it A great upgrade from an S4 I love the fingerprint capabilities I use my phone for business quite a bit and I have to have security so this is a nice feature Battery life is better than my S4 for sure Considering that my S7 edge is new and has only been activated for 10 days I also bought a protective case and screen protector but that didnt a difference Samsung claims the phone is shatter proof and water resistant but my device is useless and damaged after dropping it less than one foot in a puddle of water 1 ft I was misled into thinking this phone was less prone to break down but my audio is completely muffled now and sometimes muted with the exception of the speaker but Voice Commands doesnt even work Very disappointed The screen is completely shattered and the protective cases for the S7 Edge dont even work because of the design the screen Dont purchase  I have had this phone for about a month I upgraded from an S4 and its amazing Camera rocks no crashes no memory issues everything runs smoothly Battery is way better than the S4 I highly recommend this phone I was very excited to buy another Samsung product and decided to wait to buy this phone when it came out As I cannot download apps from Google Play unless Im NOT on Wifi it is worthless to me I have tried all the fixes out there I hate this phone Unless you guys work with Google to fix the software so I can update my apps with google play or even download I will not recommend this product I know Im not alone on this issue Although it took awhile to get used to the differences between the s7 and earlier models the product is very user friendly The Samsung Galaxy s7 is the best phone I have ever had The camera is awesome features are great and it is waterproof Size is just right and the battery life is amazing I would recommend this phone to anyone needing a new one Much improved performance Only wish it had a larger screen This phone has more issues than my last samsung
 galaxy s5

5 I have issues with audible that I never had with any other phone
6 Bluetooth range is a lot smaller So far I love it  Still getting used to it Love what used to be the home button now allows me to close running programs quickly My first smart phone works great everything I expected Love my phone Wouldnt change for the world My review text is to short but I dont have anything else to say Much better battery life in compare to the older models I have only had my s7 for 3 weeks but so far I like it The camera is excellent with bright beautiful pictures I thought my s5 was fast but s7 is faster It truly allows you to have the world at your fingertips in an instant I am pleased with the battery life thus far Once I figure out how to make it stop notifying me for Everything I will like it even more I am sure I had the S4S5and upgraded straight to the S7 Overall I love all samsung products and favor them over any other brands I like the navigation of the phone I have only had one problem a month after I got the phone the screen just went black But I went into the store and they reset it and it is good as new and has not happened again Best phone excellent battery life fast going between apps Highly recommend Over all I would give it 5  Other than I would like a longer lasting battery but thats only because it would be great to only have to charge a phone every 2 or 3 days That said the overall performance is awesome The phone feels great in my hand and the color of the phone Gold Platinum is really nice First time I ever went away from a black phone Ive always loved the fact you can customize the Galaxy phone to my tastes The screen is a great size and the colors are very vivid Combined with the wireless charging this is the perfect phone for me Ive only had this phone for a few weeks now but am loving it The battery life is so much better than my s6not sure that is an advertised feature but it is important to me The phone is great all the features exceed expectations The water resistant was a great feature to add to these phones not having to worry about a spill is excellent The feel of the phone is nice and rich doesnt feel plastic or cheap Camera works phenomenal low light feature works great The performance speeds were great no lagging what so ever Phone is great but I may have received a dud as my battery life seems to be sporadic Some days it will last other days it dies in 6 hours with normal use Other than that the phone feels great to hold is fast and responsive and definitely worth the price So far I LOVE this phone Only had it for a few days but super easy to use Has all the features I need The phone is light weight This is a HUGE step up coming off the Motorola Droid Screen is bright crisp and clear Camera is easy to use Focuses nicely and quick on shots LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone Pretty much the only reason for buying the S7 was the camera Slow mo virtual and an easier to use editor I havent even tapped into ALL that it can do but so far amazing I switched over a couple of years ago I got the note 4 than note edge and now note edge 7 I absolutely love samsung Before my note 4 I had iPad iPhone Mac and have gotten rid of everything except for the ipadIm all for Samsung and will never switch again Samsung electronics are the best I just got a s2gear and its amazing as well We even have samsung tvs just all around best quality thanks samsung for great products Disappointed in samsung for not fixing problems with phone yet I needed to replace phone within days because the WiFi wouldnt work Actually phone I have still doesnt but I didnt replace again due to the fact that I dont want to install everything on the phone for a third time The fix I was told was turn off Bluetooth to use WiFi Which still doesnt work all the time I shouldnt have to do that to access data without using plans data Other than that phone is great Color and pictures are amazing Usually when it comes to getting a new phone I except to be Wowed But not this phone the only added features I was happy to see back was the SD card only and I was not impressed so much about the IP67 and Lil Waynes champagne commercial at all I finally upgraded from my S4 to the S7 I had looked into the S6 when it came out but didnt like the fact there was no SD card slot The S7 has a 32 gig internal memory plus the SD slot which I love 
This phone seems to have all the pluses from former models The picture is great the speakers are better the camera is great This is the first Samsung phone I have ever owned and by far the best phone I have ever owned very responsive with apps and internet Voice clarity while using the phone is excellent I have had absolutely no issues with this phone at all This phone works great the camera takes excellent pictures I love the health monitoring feature that pairs with S Health Would buy again  Great phone with great hardware My favorites are water resistance microSD card and good graphics I recommend NovaLauncher to organize the apps and the desktop I deactivate quick charger 999 of the time I do a good job monitoring my phones battery life I just cant get over this phone Awesome decision  I just keep finding cool stuff to love Im in love with the camera on this phone I can take a picture and it focuses beautifully and is so detailed and vibrant I love the fingerprint locking system and how long my battery lasts I can use it all day and it not run out of battery And the charger is so fast I love it I also live the fact that I dont have to be worried about getting my phone wet So great I dont like how the tabs work in chrome The fact that they arent all just tabs in the app makes me accidentally close a lot of pages I didnt want to Also I dont get the point of being able to shrink a page I just keep accidentally doing it when I dont want to and it gets irritating and I dont get the reason for it so much Everything else is good so far though It charges extremely fast has a fantastic camera display and multi tasking is a breeze on this device Did not expect it to be this good however carrier bloatware should be reduced There are a few useless apps using up space I have had just about every type smartphone that has been out since 2008 I work for a wireless phone company and enjoy getting to use all the different devices About 2 years ago I started to really like the Samsung products and use for my personal device Last year I was excited to get the galaxy s6 but soon learned the battery was not up to par for everything it could do Samsung has hit the ball out of the park with the galaxy s7 Everything runs amazingly and the battery will last all day and most of the night with heavy use Best phone I have ever purchased The camera is amazing and the processor is super quick I love the design its very comfortable holding it Works super fast I also love the that I can add a micro SD card and the water resistant part I am happy so far with my new phone I love Samsung products and would highly recommend this phone It has more memory and seems easy to navigate I bought this phone last month Its the worst phone ever its very slippery it advertise to have a long lasting batter after a couple of calls and a few text massages and dont dare check your email I love my new phone Easier to use convenient functions that pop up with ease Best one Ive ever owned And the camera is amazing Dont hesitate to get you one Worth every cent I am a Samsung guy i love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge all my phones that Ive owned have been Samsung i love the products Samsung offers I have Samsung tablets and samsung TVs and all my family have Samsung phones because of me I will continue to buy Samsung products for the rest of my life I woulf love to meet the owners of Samsung and thank them for the awesome expierence that they provide for other Samsung users and I The S7 Edge is absolutely amazing The curved edges still impress me every time I look at the screen Speaking of the screen the quality is astonishing just like the pictures Im able to take whether its the beauty around me or the awesome selfie Im taking However one thing that stands out the most is the battery life its ridiculously long This phone is the best you can get I just wish the headphone jack was on the top not bottom  and a better speaker I used to have an Iphone 5 but then when I saw this phone being release and reviewed the functionality of it and the feature I waited for it and purchased it right away when I am capable of buying it and now I am enjoying it on my day to day communication needs Definitely this should be recommended for everyone who are still searching for a phone to used Overall i really like my Samsung It works great I really like how I can customize it to how I use it everyday I would definitely recommend this product to other people I was waiting for the storage insert to come back and it did This is my fourth galaxy I have always been a fan of them I was disappointed when they took away the SD card feature Now they brought it back Ive been Samsung loyal for 8 years this is by far the worse product made I love the camera but I continued to have to restart the phone continuously Didnt matter the app Could not watch movies videos etc or the phone begins to buffer 4g didnt work efficiently Most of all I use the phone for work and it would just black out on calls The phone is great just wish there was a phone cases available that covers the entire phone at a reasonable price this product is a step better then my old note 3 the screen is about the same size but it is slimmer and lighter fits into my car phone holder great I love this phone it is everything I need in a phone and so much more Samsung never fails when it comes to new products I would definitely recommend this phone The best part is the camera it is awesome I have a new baby and it takes the best picture and videos so I can remember all the memories we are making Thanks Samsung All the features are great and it runs very fast The issue is that it reboots frequently during the day and several programs wont open with WiFi connected It may be the apps but my last phone did not have that issue Good phone very fast display is awesome nice start up So far I have enjoy using the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Im looking for to keep playing with and figure out all its features I also hope they add more themes and widgets to keep it up to date This is the best phone out hands down The features are limited less and the VR is Amazing Just an awesome phone Great job Samsung Great all around phone Fast Smooth Easy to navigate and easy on the eyes S7 Edge is sleek design with power and features to back it up Love it and the SD slot returning Thats why well stick with Samsung Thanks Ive had the s7 edge for a few weeks now Im always finding new features and love the capabilities of the edge screen Would recommend

Negative screen protector kept coming off due to the curved edge screen This is my first smart phone I own Although it was very hard at first due to to fact that I never had one I started to get through it with ease Love it dont know why I waited so long

Anthony F The Samsung galaxyS7 Edgeis a great phone that has a really convient edge screen that is really useful if you need information now This is my first Galaxy phone and I have been told that I started with the best I had concerns about the battery life but have yet to have an issue with it  and I use my phone A LOT Getting used to the functions didnt take long at all and I love the Edge option I have not added the Micro SD card yet but plan to take advantage of the additional storage option The pictures are AMAZING and I love the shutter speed Very pleased with my purchase and recommend the phone to everyone I see I love the phone its great but it over heats when you are using the gear vr I would for you guys to fix that problem and I wish the phone came with wireless charger overall its a great phone My first galaxy was a 3 Then I went to a 5 and now I have a 7These phones are amazing And I pretty much buy everything Samsunglol

Disappointed that there is no IR Blaster so it no longer works as a remote I purchased an S7 Edge to replace an Xperia Z2 that had a fatal water leak The Android update from Lollipop to Marshmallow took a little getting used to but what was really noticeable was the extra programs inherent to the Samsung phone bloatware There is a lot of it and I wish I could pick and choose which I wanted The ATT software was also bloaty but not as bad as Samsung Getting used to the edge features is difficult when using one handed because gripping the phone sometimes entails the skin touching the edge screen Overall I find the Edge a very good phone and would recommend it I think that an Edge Plus would a required twohanded phone Having a baby the camera on this phone captures so many precious moments and the storage allows me to have so many The battery life seems to be amazing as well for when i cant always plug in while at work The technology to use the wirless charger blew my mind The thought of it being water proofresistant gives me ease while i prepare to enjoy the approaching summer at the pool and beach I am very happy with the S7 The bloatware is a bit ridiculous which Boggs it down a bit and the battery drains quickly super fast charger is great but overall a great phone New new speaker location gets covered by my finger when I am holding it in landscape mode but better than being on the back Best and most useful phone Ive had Even slider edge bar was easy to learn Easier faster best mobile phone by far on the market Only negative battery goes down quicker than the S4 but great news samgung made a fix The S7 recharges extremely fast Great phone Did even mention water proof Always been a fan of Samsung and this phone has exceeded all my expectations The camera quality is amazing and the software is super fast This has definitely made my life easier and everyone Ive talked to is fascinated by its design and quality There are quite a few features missing on the s7 that the s5 had Some apps and font features wont even work with marshmallow I used to like that galaxy was so much more personalized capable seems they are slowly taking that away This phone wont stay connected to WiFi or my Bluetooth headset even if its sitting right beside it Makes no sense The ram is low too It advertises 4 gb of ram but we are lucky to see 3 With the system running 15 and even the apps at 700mb That leaves barely 1 gb free Also the unwanted apps that automatically come on the phone I disable them but they continue to redownload and update There are some apps that cant even be disabled that are pointless 

On the plus side the camera is better splash resistant the phone better looking And the speaker is on the bottom instead of the back The screen is awesome and the speed is spectacular I am still playing with the ins and outs and have had the phone for 2 weeks But have had random shutdowns while in the middle of gaming or searching the web This phone has really very good edge experience and screen display is awesome The S7 edge is one of the best wireless devices I have used in a long time It fits very well in the hand and the curved screen puts it to the next level I find it very user friendly both for personal and business use Also the expandable memory does wonders for the availability to transfer files quickly I have not been a Samsung fan and have tried many different devices in the past But if they keep making them like this I will keep buying Its everything I was hoping for in a phone since my last phone gave me issues I am totally happy with it and hope it continues to make my life a little bit easier I love the new Galaxy S7 Great camera slimmer design awesome features I upgraded from an s3 to an s7 and I am glad I did The camera is great great quality and it just feels good in my hand Upgraded from the Galaxy 4seasier to useGoogle and Samsung apps are grouped separate icons which makes using those apps easier as they are groups in their own folderbattery lasts all day had a backup for the 4scolors are amazingcamera quality is a nice upgradesound and voice quality much betterwould have like the larger screen if the Edge however but heard negatives of the curved edges causing easy screen breakageall in all very satisfied and would recommendlive Samsung productseven got my hubby to upgrade Great phone best one Ive had so fari have several samsung products and I love all of them easy to use and learn and has all the features Im looking for They are the best I would never buy any other product Samsung only Wonderful phone Long battery Good feel in the hand Nice design and power combo Replaceable battery would have been excellent Speakers are not that great Great product great features I love Samsung products I have personally owned 4 Samsung phones Ive had an S4 and an S6 Edge  which was lost or Id still have it  and I have to say I am thrilled with the S7 Edge I got as a replacement for the S6 Its way better IMHO just because it works better reception internet and the features seem to work better for me I could never get the S6 to distinguish between email texts Messenger messages etc so I had to turn down the notifications for all of them Bingo the S7 right away asked for notifications for all of them and they dont bug me like on the S6 The internet and downloading and app usage all are just way more smooth and easy I love the S7 Edge and highly recommend it even if you have an S6 and have the opportunity to step up Also I am a photographer and videographer and the camera rocks on this phone The phone is very fast of course it is brand new and the battery life is impressive Awesome phone all around I love my display The time is always present and convenient Camera is exceptional I bought this phone last week and am really loving the way it operates So much easier to use than my Iphone was Keep learning something new about it everyday Some simple features I really loved
1 Move old contacts pictures data from old phone to new phone very easily
2 Delete unnecessary contacts collected over the years with a simple click Just select and delete
3 Camera is just awesome
4 Chat heads  Each time someone sends a chata nice head pops up on the edge I love this phone I have always liked Samsung devices they work well and last a long time I absolutely LOVE this phone I had an iPhone before and will never go back Great phone would like the off on button on top and the headset also on top The camera takes great pictures and is quick to pull up from your lock screen Overall it has been a very good phone so far The only two things I dont like are first I want to be able to change the battery second I dont want to take my SIM card out every time I take my SD card out I Love love love my new s7 The features on it are great Love how fast it is Finally a phone that can keep up with my fast texting Very clear screen display Would recommend this phone to everyone samsung rocks sleek streamline design great apps made the setup quick and easy love the edge to quickly get to my fav contacts and sites hd screen makes videos pop  the camera captures great pics did i mention video text i knowamazing i love it  highly recommend This is the second samsung phone Ive owned and the features offered continue to improve The phone performs all functions very well I have not had to wait for any function to run This is certainly an upgrade from my s4 but there are a few features that dont seem to have the freedom that my s4 did However overall I really like the phone and features that go along with it I LOVE my S7 In my view way better than the Note I switch from the Note 4 to S7 and glad I did I can add additional memory to it Love the gold color Amazing phone the best Samsung has ever come out with I am happy I waiting for the Samsung 7salways a happy customer of Samsung The phone is amazingly fast Screen resolution is excellent Games play flawlessly Small issue is with the battery I know a 3000 mah mili amp is a good size However I seem to be almost dead every day with limited use I do have a watch and a set if lg tones connected always and that might run it down a little Just seems to be a little weaker that the s7 edge that I have Edge gets a full day with a lot left S7 just struggles Apart from that the phone is absolutely fantastic Everything Samsung left out in the S6 they brought back with the S7 except Exynos I purchased a Lifeproof case as well even tho the phone is already water resistant it just adds extra protection Phone is fast and the MicroSD Card slow is nice Battery life is also improved but as all phones could be better for heavy users and stamina people Love the S7 and the Gear VR is pretty cool too If you are looking to buy a new phone this is a great one to have Its literally the best phone Ive owned Used to own an iPhone until the galaxy s6 and Samsung is much better Never had an issue with it Love it I do wish the back didnt show so many finger prints but my case fixed that Love the camera and the feature that come with it I wish the phone worked like it should i really liked the phone but i had issues with dropped calls and the keyboard not registering to my touch I took one back and got a new one thought maybe i just got a bad phone but I had the same problems on the next one I returned the phone all together and just went back to my GS5 I never had any issues with that phone I really liked the s7 i just wish it didnt have so many bugs I have owned various Samsung devices and been very pleased however the S7 Edge took a giant step forward in performance style and features My wife and I have had the Samsung S7 edges for a few weeks now i have to say wow We have had no issues with anything we have needed the phone to do The speed is still amazing and the screen has eye popping color The Edge feature is convenient and slick The camera has great pixel texture and makes taking pictures easy and fun I recently upgraded from the S5 to the S7 and I couldnt be more happy Many similarities as far as operating the S5 but classier and more streamlined Very happy that it is lighter weight than the S5 and longer and a bit narrower but only enough to consider it an improvement I was always very happy with the S5 and had it for over 2 years even skipping over the S6 as I saw no reason to change but I am very pleased I finally did Very seamless operating and the long life battery and super quick charging are a big plus for me Highly recommended In my opinion the Samsung S7 Edge is the best cell phone ever made Im sure something will come along in the future and blow this one away But for now its the one to beat Its processor is super fast Surfing the internet on the cell phone is very convenient and its fast This phone is so great I bought a second one for work Love the edge screen with all its features I updated from a Samsung 3 to the Samsung 7 Many things have changed since the galaxy 3 The 7 is easy to use and rely able  Im sold on Galaxy I love my Samsung Galaxy s7 it was easy to set up and transfer all my info and data to it is also easy to use I love the ability to use more than one app at a time I think the navigation of the phone is very easy I would recommend this phone to anybody Only flaw is a I wish it came with a better music appinterface to playback music the volume output is really low compared to the s5 Love how it feels in my hands although a bit slippery so need to think of a case I like everything about this phone except it has poor reception in a lot of locations and Im with Verizon for 18 years It reminds me of a phone I had 6 years ago it drops calls in the same areas as my old cell phone did this really bothers me Im not in a rural area either

The other issue I have is that with too many apps it started to heat up to the point it made my leg warm

But the look the size and the way it responds are all very good and I would recommend Im just disappointed in the reception the battery time and being slippery Love the feel of this phone compared to my previous Galaxy 5 It feels much more resilient and offers the same and better features of my previous phone I love it Great features great size The only thing is that it turns on in my purse easy I did like my Note 3s alarm better but besides that Im in love The camera is the bomb Upgraded from an S4 to the S7 and am very pleased with the phone Has great features I purchased this phone just over a month ago It work very well Battery life is ok Lots of features packed in good battery life and LOTS of features features that a lot of people wont use or need First time Samsung device owner here I have been an android guy for ever but have never really been interested in Samsung phones And to be honest I was not really looking for one this time But once I put my hands on the display unit I knew right then that this phone was worth giving second thought too after about 15 minutes with the phone I was hooked I figured hey I have 14 days to check it out And I did go check out the other offerings but wow that felt cheap compared to the quality of the s7 edge So I just might be A Samsung user for life now Way to go Samsung on converting another into the fold Great phone Had it for about 1 month and really no problems with it Ive had my phone for about a month now No issues with it yet fast and reliable Just wish ATT was faster on the OTA software updates This phone has all the things that you want a phone to do Samsung has done a great job with the software and the hardware is simply amazing This is a great phone I enjoy the Samsung series I was thinking about switching to the iPhone but Im really glad I stuck with the Samsung I have been a fan of the Galaxy phones since the S2 This is a great phone with lots of features So happy to have expandable memory with this model Thank you Samsung for bringing this back Battery life is a big plus for me since it will last me through a whole day of work easily I highly recommend this phone I thought when I got my phone it would blow my mind with its speed andbuild quality Ive been pretty disappointed because my home button is really loose and my phone is laggy I had been a user of iPhone 5s for 2 years before getting this Galaxy S7 which is much better in design and battery recharge One or two drawbacks I notice in S7 are that weather updates can be hourly to the shortest possible as compared to 5s live update to that very moment you check it Another one you can very easily snap and save in photos any screen view on 5s by pressing the home and power keys simultaneously which is lacking on S7 Other than that since I use smartphones for calls texts browse emails take snaps or post on FB only I am comfortable with S7 performance Price is within reach of an average consumer even when the product is just getting in the market wow This is a great phone love it  very great Love the phone the only drawback so far is the edge is too sensitive But I am getting used to it Over all great phone It doesnt have the capability of the Samsung Galaxy 7 I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 32GB Verizon Black Onyx it is easy to use light weight  and holds everything I need I even got my 70 year old mother who is against the newer phone switch from her old flip phone to a Samsung Galaxy S7 32GB Verizon Black Onyx  Way to go Samsung on this one  Compared to the Note series I disliked the s7Edge The s7 does not seem to function well for business apps and also the fact of no stylus pen was very troublesome I have had a lot of devices This is hands down the best device on the market I would recommend this to friends and family I liked the phone very much but it did not have the capacity to receive a strong enough signal at my home or work to use it Even with an external antenna the problem remained We returned them and I still have my Apple 5c I love this phone Easy to operate I just love it The new Samsung S7 is the best ever Great system to transfer your old phone to the new S7 Easy as eating apple pie The new battery has a long lasting capability
They have tweaked several features mostly for the positive I like the main screen which has time dateday and  of battery left 

The camera is as good or even better than an I Phone They have maintain many of the old features but switched their name The idea of having an sd card it get for storage
I am very pleased with this phone It cost me a little extra for an early upgrade but it was worth it

 I am very much in love with Samsung products Its the best This phone is fast and efficient and I love all the new features This product fits perfectly in the hands and it works great every day I love this phone everything about it the camera is amazing it has great battery life This product is over all good The only thing I have a problem with is that when you hold the phone naturally your fingers wrap around the side It messes with the touchscreen so you have to hold it awkwardly I love the s7 the overall feel of it The features are nice and I love being able to put a memory stick in it again Plus the battery life has improved a lot from the S6 which is very helpful during a long day at work Battery cycle between charging is terrible Having trouble downloading pictures to my computer Still havent figured out how to receive visual voice mail notifications The phone wont hook up to my Bluetooth Plantronics earpiece like the S4 this replaced On the plus side the camera is far superior with no delay when pressing the button to take a picture This is a great phone I love the edge screen all your favorites in one spot This phone is really user friendly and definitely liked the expandable memory they brought back Not bulky and the silver color really makes it pop Very nice There are a few things I miss with my other edge phone I had with samsung but other then that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PHONE Had the S5 before this and now upgraded I couldnt be happier large memory quick processing sleek design 

Only downfall is that it has a sealed battery Just when you though the Galaxy S series couldnt get better the S7 Edge proves that you can improve on perfection The user friendly features couple with the sleek design guarantees that I will be a Samsung customer for life My wife phone of choice is the iPhone 6s Plus but shes jealous of my phone I will make her a Samsung customer in the near future Picture quality is fantastic Best Ive had on a phone yet I have always had Samsung everythingit all stared with the Samsung S2 which I absolutely fell in love with Then moved on to the S3 Samsung kitchen appliances the Samsung pro tab and the home theater system I convinced my husband to upgrade his LG to the Samsung and now he is hooked too As soon as our new house is built house fire I will be able to get all new Samsung appliances super excited Great job Samsung  GREAT FEATURES  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT great feel great sound Im very pleased with the upgrades and fixes Samsung applied to the S7 Excellent phone Not much to complain about thus far I got this phone two weeks ago and its the best phone I have ever owned Its an amazing phone I love it I upgraded from a S5 and the upgraded features on this are outstanding It is slimmer and a little easier to navigate the apps which Im sure will get easierstill in the new phone transition my only complaint so far is the S5 ringtone would take the highlight of a song if you wanted it to and the S5 had a higher megapixel cameraI actually won twice in a company calendar contest with my S5 But the pictures on this phone are outstanding Overall I am very happy with this phone Sooo glad they sd card has been added back in to the design This is a great phone this coming from a past iPhone user This is my 2nd Samsung phone and by far it has more features than any iPhone I ever had I am a REALTOR and the features like the camera quick link tabs buttons water proof and durability help to do my job much more efficient I had one of my teenagers switch from the iPhone 6s to the Samsung 6 active and they are hooked With the VR capabilities screen graphics and durability of the phone it is perfect for him We have no complaints The s7 performs great It is fast responding the features are good and the battery life is awesome Finally a phone that isnt needing charged twice a day The design is very eye appealing Overall I would highly recommend this to anYonex looking for a new phone I LOVE my new galaxy s7 its fast clean clear picturesvideos has better features than my old galaxy and way better than any iphone It is probably the best phone of all time and I would definitely tell everyone to buy this phone for their next phone purchase I am glad that ithe is not huge like other models Love love the camera The picture quality and speed are amazing The pictures are crystal clear on the move Love that it is water resistant So far it has good battery life and charges quickly I love the ability to download themes for the phone It gives an added personal touch The touch screen allows for smooth operation opening apps emailing or texting As Im typing or swiping it is much more seamless then my older S4 or S5 Extremely happy I upgraded Im very happy with my S7 Edge Its quality through and through Thank you Samsung  They couldnt have done it betterlove itlove it I ve always been an android person but this one really did it This is a fantastic phone storage and battery life is very good Has the power to run any and all apps Very fast and powerful I have had an iPhone 6 and others and this S7 Edge out performs all of them never drops calls the camera captures photos in extreme low light conditions 15 candle illumination without flash the Samsung Pay feature works everywhere you can swipe a card the new OS works with all my apps old and new the ability to add a micro SD card upto 200gb is nice to see again I got this phone about a week and a half ago and so far its great The design is awesome and the features are nice but itd be nice if there was more for the edge Easy to use Pictures and options such amazing I would like to have more options to backgrounds on text messages absolutely love the phone is amazing  great quality battery life time is really good good processor no lagging expandable memory water resistant ip68 no overheating is just amazing  love all the new features on the edge is actually worth it This phone is just awesome I work outside a lot so the water proof and dust proof feature is very important to me I also am glad they brought back the SD card for this phone Over all this is in my opinion the best galaxy phone put out yet I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 Edge to the S7 Edge When I bought the S6 it seemed extremely fast but eventually it became over over time and would occasionally reboot on its own Its hard to saw if Ill run in to performance issues on the S7 down the road but Ive had it for over a month now and havent had any problems yet The things I like most coming from the S6 Edge are the larger screen better battery life and expandable storage To me the larger screen and bigger battery finally make the added cost of the Edge version justifiable I also really appreciate the water resistance I havent been walking around pouring champagne on my phone but I havent had to worry quite as much when using the phone in or around the pool Also not sure if this has anything to do with the water resistant feature but I noticed with the S6 that when my hands were even a little wet or sweaty the fingerprint sensor would never recognize my print however I dont seem to have that issue with the S7 I also really like the true black color Kind of a silly reason to upgrade but I never liked any of the blue tinted options Samsung had in the past I really hope they continue to offer a true black option in future versions I have owned an S3 S5 and now a S7 This cell phone outshines the first two by a 100 percent  The battery in the S7 performs better than any phone I have owned I find that my use of Battery Doctor and like apps is minimal Where I used that app many times a day my current use is every other day or greater 

The camera far exceeds that in the S3 or 5 My photos are excellent in color The app supplied has more features and options than many of the addon photo apps contain Excellent speakers enhance my listening equal to 9equal to85706 better than any prior speakers Samsung apps exceed many of the apps in Plaistow All told I am enjoying my use of this phone far greater than any I have owned So far this phone has been excellent Everything works fast and smooth pictures look great too I love that its water proof Cant really ask for anything more in a phone I like the camera quality and speed The processing speed is lightning fast so far The battery life is excellent I love that the phone is water resistant it really gives me peace on mind The display screen is amazing I love how the phone can be charged with a wireless charger which I have also purchased the wireless fast charger This phone had amazing features The screen is bright and pictures are so clear Navigation of the Web is fast I am able to do many more thing that I wasnt able to do or see on my previous phone I do have preference for Samsung phones over other makers Because everyone out there is trying to make better phones is hard to keep up with everything so far Samsung is doing the best with the top of the line cameras water proof equipment and for me and i think most of the people out there it has to be the expandable memory This phone has every feature imaginable The camera just makes all of the rest out there look bad Overall I really like this phone It is fast reliable and has a long battery life I like the increased memory though I wish I would have ordered a 64 GB size The VR files are all stored in the phones memory I also dont like the placement of the mute button I have face muted people on multiple occasions Lastly I am disappointed that Samsung has eliminated the infrared transmitter option Maybe I was one of the few but I used my last phone many times as a remote control especially in conjunction with my cable apps The speed on this thing is incredible The pictures are absolutely beautiful as well Samsung S5 seemed to have a better signalnot sure why but it does Other than that I like this phone wondering if I should have gotten the edge though Ive only had this phone for a couple of days but so far it performs much better than my Note 4 did when it was new the Stylus wasnt a priority and the edge while kind of gimmicky turns out to be quite functional I look forward to more functionality out of it as developers create more widgets for it The finger print scanner has been vastly improved to the point where I might actually use it The fast focus on the camera is very nice and Ive never owned a phone capable of such clear photos I can upgrade every year with my carrier but Im not sure how quickly Ill run in to trade this away This phone has a great camera I would use it for the camera alone Luckily it also has all the other features I like as well so far i really like the phone Love the camera only a glitch where the screen turns black and you know the phone is on but the back light wont come on Comfy in my hand Works great with my watch Love my phone First off I was hesitant to switch from the S6 to the S7 Loved the S6 but wow I am so glad I did It is lightening fast Battery life is amazing The extra features added including going back to expandable memory are great adds The combined mega icons are awesome additions Screen brightness feature is a welcome surprise The camera though less MP is actually much better The audio is much better than the S6 as well Speaker moved to bottom of phone near charging port and throws the sound much better I bought two and my wife and I are both extremely satisfied I would highly recommend the upgrade to anyone I had to get a new one 6 days after I bought it I never dropped it it never got wet but the screen went completely out but still rang got text messages and the alarm kept going off After I got it exchanged I havent had too many issues just inapp problems such as facebook and messenger but overall much better I love the phone itseems great Very customizable right out of the box and learns your personality and voice extremely quick But I would have wished the screen was more durable I already cracked it just by dropping it about a foot and a half out of my shirt pocket  Other then that its my main tool thoroughly my job as a over the road truck driver Love the phone It does not lie when it says that it feels good when it sits in your hand I have had it in a case since I got it but on the occasion I take it out and it truly does feel amazing My only problem is the sensitivity on the side myself having larger hands my fingers are catching on the sides Other than that it is a very well designed phone inside and out Love this phone It runs so fast and smooth Its ability to multi task is amazing I can be browsing Facebook and reddit at the same time Camera is super clear very easy to use I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade to a new phone This phone is the right size good looking and much faster processor than my note3 Great phone Wish I could double soft tap the home button to drop the screen like the iPhone Also my battery has be slightly disappointing but everything else about the phone is great I had a Samsung Galaxy S5 and waited for the S7s to come out before upgrading I decided to go with the edge Im glad I did performance is great and the screen is awesome This phone is sleek stylish fast water resistant very fast and has the best battery life I have ever seen Ive owned a lot of phones upwards of 15 smartphones and this is by far the best one I have ever owned Pefection Samsung did an amazing with the Galaxy S7 Straight out of the box it was love at first sight I felt like ive made a good investment This is the phone ive been waiting for I love the design the features the Gold Platinum color scheme the camera is the fastest and takes the best pictures ive ever seen on any phone ive owned the buttery feel of the slightly curved glass on the front and back of the phone the display its quick the battery life is well improved its quick and most importantly they brought back the SD card slot and Water Resistance Great Job Samsung I would recommend the Galaxy S7 to anyone who doesnt own one I switched from a windows phone to the new galaxy s7 edge All the apps are way more robust plus the speed is amazing The voice recognition is great and the resolution is outstanding Moved up from an S4 to the S7 Love it Beautiful device although it dented already due to dropping it on its side Marshmallow OS is easy to use Samsung pay is a nice feature great to have if you forgot your wallet I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to my S7 The camera is amazing but that is the only feature Im thrilled about The screen keeps turning on by itself Battery life doesnt last as long as they claim it does I hate the alarm clock as it has less capabilities than the one on the S4 Battery isnt removable I have a bit of buyers remorse but my 14 day return period ended today I hope they fix the issue with the screen turning on by itself very soon I purchased my S7 in hopes that it would have Peel or Watch On available to control my Samsung TV but the app isnt available Im disappointed The updates and tweaks are what you have come to expect from Samsung Love the enhanced camera and larger screen of the S7 edge The only drawback is it is hard to install a screen protector due to the curved surface A minor annoyance Slim and fun to play with Great camera features and overall a great buy I just got the new samsung galaxy s7 edge and love it The phone takes amazing pictures it has great performance in terms of battery life and use The media quality is cryatal clear and louder then other phones Overall great quality Love the size and the black color style I love this phone absolutely the best phone Thank you Samsung So far this phone is a hit love bit smaller size compared to the S5 expandable memory and enjoy all tje cameraa has to offer I had an S3 note prior to this oneit was a good phonethis one is so much faster and capablelove ittrying to talk my wife into upgrading to this My S7 has all the of the things I love about cell phones only better I got my first cell phone over 20 years ago and I have lost count of how many I have had Some of them were really bad I have had an S4 and S5 and so far this is the best phone I have owned People keep asking me  What kind of phone is that The clerks in the stores are surprised that the Samsung Pay works just like the commercial
I am still a little concerned about not being able to remove and change the battery but I am getting used to it The battery life is good One quirk is that I have not been able to find a screen protector that covers the whole screen This is a great phonedoes everything I need it to do I love my new S7 and cant imagine getting through the day without it I upgraded from Samsung S5 which I had for two years I upgraded because of battery degrading Had some growing pains with Samsung S7Edge contacts calendar and texting are a little different I really like the My Places feature which changes the phone setting sound display and Apps used most to different locations that I set I have had the phone for three weeks and as of now the only complaint is the lack of Ring Tones that is not dance music or nature sounds First of all the one major thing that is wrong with this phone is that the SD card keeps ejecting Everything else on this phone is good and standard if youve owned a previous galaxy device

To elaborate the SD card problem is more than just annoying At random times throughout the day or night the card ejects and re inserts internally Although its a great addition and the reason I upgraded from my galaxy s5 its not worth the inconvenience There isnt anything you could do to fix this problem unless you just dont add external storage

Me and countless others throughout many forums have tried possible solutions that fail to entertain a permanent solution

If you dont care about external storage this phone is the way to go or just stick with your s6 and wait for the next thing If youre the kind of person that needs all the extra storage you can possibly behold go with an s5 Its an awesome phone that performs great without any problems

If you dont have a Samsung device and want to jump in go with either an s5 or an s6 The s5 for storage purposes or the s6 for VR This phone is amazing I love all of the features especially the nighttime feature that displays timedate and alarm down the edge of the phone I also like how it automatically dims at night so youre not looking at that bright blue light I am sure there are so many more features that I havent even tapped into yet Overall outstanding phone One of the best things about this phone is the camera performance and features Incredibly fast to open the camera app Picture quality is awesome even in the dark

Also speakers sound quality is excellent My first overall for the phone and yes this is my first galaxy phone I got this phone and one for my wife and we both love the phone no complaints by far this is the absolute the features and of course Im still getting used to this phone I love how I was able to upload or download all my apps from my previous phone once again OUTSTANDING PHONE This phone has been an excellent performer It is packed with many features most of which Im still learning I had the Galaxy Note IIII went to look at the Galaxy Note5 then I saw the Galaxy S7 edge I wasnt sure if I wanted to go with a smaller phone but I didit is easy to use its fast and very clear to read
I liked it so much I bought two of them at full price and I do not regret it I recommend this great phone I love everything about the S7 and its improvements that have tremendously effected my life Its a very good phone Its fast the fingerprint reader works well The design is great The waterproof is very nice and useful I would totally recommend this phone Its a little expensive but very worth it And the battery life is top notch This is it This is the phone Ive been waiting for since I switched to Android 5 years ago

I converted to Android from iOS in 2011 I wanted the more open OS couldnt get over the utter idiocy of not being able to open a file explorer and look at the files on my phone among other things Since then I always bought the biggest and the best  always Samsung usually Galaxy Notes While they are great phones that I loved more media consumption watching movies playing games I always found the basic OS laggier and skippier than I had hoped especially for sending and receiving texts 90 of my communication these days

Enter the S7 Edge The best phone Ive ever owned It keeps all the pros that I came to Android for and finally delivers a smoothassilk snappy and intuitive multitasking experience Especially the new texting features that make responding to texts lightning fast and not interrupt what you are in the middle of on the phone I love this phone Im hoping to keep it for as long as possible but when I finally get a new one I hope they are making them exactly like this

PS I got jam on it the first week I had it and just washed it off under the faucet That was a neat experience This is over all a great phone The only exception is the sound Whether Im watching a movievideo or listening to music it just doesnt seem to have powerful sound Ive tried all the sound settings and it just doesnt get loud It doest matter if it is through the speaker or headphones or even thru my pill This is my first Samsung phone so I dont know if they are all like that My previous phone was a HTC M8 and it had fantastic sound Other then that this phone is great Huge improvement to over my S6 especially better life Computing performance is improved and I lover the fact that I have a waterproof phone I dont plan to test this but its nice to know its there if I need Great phone and I think Ill be keeping this one a while Best cell phone I have ever ownedSleek fast the edgeBeing able to print right from the phoneincredibleI would highly recommend this piece of art to any one I l9ve my new phone I just like all the Samsung products Ive had my s7 for about 3 weeks and it has yet to disappoint The battery life has been great and the overall performance has been fast and responsive To date it has exceeded my expectations Ive already recommend this phone to several coworkers that want to get away from their iPhones I do however wish the speakers werent on the bottom of the phone but for that being my only complaint Ill take it Thanks Samsung This phone is the best I have ever owned I had the s6 edge and this blows it out of the water It is faster bigger and has a much nicer design Battery life is amazing I use it most of the day and I usually still have 25 left when going to bed Not to mention its water resistant So I originally got the nite 5 and didnt like it so I traded it in for this and I am so glad I did Battery lasts forever I charge my phone once every two days User friendly Only two complaints is that it did not come with the Swype keyboard preinstalled and no preinstalled music player Other than that this is a great phone that outshines all the competition Always have been and always will be a galaxy guy The new Samsung Galaxy S7 is a solid performer packed with great features and finally a battery life that will last throughout the day The S7 has a stunning color screen fantastic camera both front and rearfacing I took it recently on vacation and was amazed as the incredible pictures I was able to take The colors and clarity were true to form and surpassed my expectations The last and for me the most important feature to have BACK into the Galaxy line is the external memory card This was a setback for me with the S6 and happy that Samsung actually listened to their customers I have to charge the battery much earlier in use than I had to with my 5 My new phone cant wait to use it on a regular basis This is the best yet intuitive bright and has a strong receiver I go through LOTS of phones in a year I usually own a few of the flagships a few of the midrangers and a few of the budget phones every year I have always been an android user until recently I tried out the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus just to try something different The one thing I really enjoyed with the iPhone was that it just worked with little zero lag But then the S7 phones came out and I dropped the iPhone to see what Samsung had to offer I was overwhelmed with what Samsung had done with the S7 Edge This phone is FAST with zero lag Im not a gamer so I cant speak on lag to gaming but for media consumption and as a pocketsized computer this one was a homerun Ive installed Nova launcher and am running this phone exactly as I like and Ive have no issues at all This is definitely a phone that I plan on keeping for a while I love all the features big battery wireless charging microSD support weather resistance etc and the phone looks great The only suggestion I have is that since the phone is all glass on the front and back panels I would like to see a oleophobic coating on the glass to reduce those finger prints And as always Id like to see the toughest glass possible on the phone but a case can fix that issue Had a note 3 and was shy about upgrading This was a great idea Galaxy 7 is a wonderful phone Pure Samsung quality I love the feel of it in my hand The picture is crisp and clear The processor is fast The camera takes great pictures and has some cool new features I love that its water resistant All in all a fantastic device I couldnt be happier The S7 Edge is incredibly fast and smooth in operation The edge screen takes a few minutes to get used to but comes in very handy for shortcuts Buy a casethe phone is extremely slick and polished inside and out I love this new samsung s7 edge Screen is clear pictures are crisp and sharp I had the samsung s5 and got this as an upgrade and all i can say is wow Love samsung Im very pleased with the quality of and battery life for the Samsung Galaxy S7 The samsung Galaxy s7 is a fantastic phone Not only is it easy to use but easy in terms of price The one thing I was happy samsung brought back was the sd card slot Then you wont feel pressured of space on the phone Another great feature is the camera It is 12 megapixels on the back Not only the camera features great but the quality of video and photos is phenomenal Also I love how this phone has Qi charger capabilities Since it makes it easier than to fumble for wires or feel as if you may damage the micro usb slot While the speaker on the phone may be small but when you do a call via speaker phone it sounds as if the person is right next to you I have only had it for a short time but I am really enjoying this phone Good design great features luv this phone great camera good video I also like the water proof abilities Best phone I ever had
Excellent performance and quality The camera is amazing
Very compatible with my Samsung Smart TV
I only hope that Samsung will send future firmware and updates instead of ATT The s7 edge is a great phone so far The use of the edge of the screen is rather disappointing there are only a few apps that support it and most of those fees you garbage info from yahoo only Im really happy with the S7 and my wife who has an S5 will soon be upgrading to the S7
The screen is so gorgeous even my bad pictures look great And yes the camera is second to none Im an amateur photographer who no longer laments not having a real camera with me at all times 

I was using the Note5 before this and I will say that I do miss all the S Pen functionalityIm a husband and father and always needing to write something down quickly Not needing to unlock the device and also not needing my thumbs is a big advantage My daughter loved to draw or write while in the car

I bought the CaseMate Clear cover along with the BodyGuardz screen protector and feel confident that with those and the strength of your products it will survive for a long time

Thank you
Tom Love the new look And love the fact that its a lot like my s5 I had this phone is very to use The battery life could be a little better but otherwise its a great phone I love Samsung and I love this phone It is by far the best one yet Great features great looks its simple slick its awesome Overall device is good

What I like
Camera is a lot of improvement specially in terms of low light dual pixel
Size is enough to fit in hand ans all things are reachable in one hand
SD card capacity is huge
Many apps are already grouped in folder saving  of pages and  to speed
Finger Print Scanner is nice improvement
Edge Panel people panel showing color alert
Fast device
Enough RAM for multitasking
Liquid cooling seems to be working well
Device keeps locked in pocket avoiding accidental calls
Camera is really fast


Dislikes 
Due to pack glass like coverpanel its little slippery
Battery should be removable as sometimes mobile gets hang and nothing can be done other than removing batter to reset it If its not removable then you have to wait till it get fully discharged and device gets shut down itself
Few good features were removed eg Air View  which was giving good amt of information when hovered on messages gallery video Auto Scroll  it was tracking your eyes or head movement to scroll page up or down Smart Pause  stopping gallery video when not looking at it Air Browse  was a good feature to navigate from pictures in gallery now only swiping is the option
Edge Panel is not automatic need to be rubbed to get information
Dual Pixel should have been there along with 16 MP camera as a real innovation than reducing it to 12 MP The S6 was great but the s7 edge is amazing The camera rivals my pro dslr it s waterproof the screen is amazingget it I loved this phone as soon as I got it The issues with the Internet connection is difficult to deal with but hopefully that gets fixed soon The battery life is good and also the Camara is the best Still getting used to the edge features but it is an awesome speedy phone Before I had this phone as a work phone I was not a fan of Samsung or Android After receiving my Samsung s7 edge I have not stopped talking about how much I love it It is a beautiful device it fits well in my hands and it is extremely easy to use I would highly recommend this phone My wife was an avid iPhone user when I showed her the simplicity and the many options on my phone She immediately wanted one just like it The S7 Just what was needed So far this phone has done well with what I need it for Has features that work well with my lifestyle Fingerprint reader and Samsung pay is a must for me now that I am using it regularly Great phone but battery life doesnt Live up to the hype Dont like that even after setting a pin I have to swipe to get to enter screen  I purchased this phone to replace a 4 year old phone and the experience has been excellent There has been a slight learning curve to using a smart phone overall but this phone is easy to use and the camera is pretty go for a phone  The battery has been lasting for almost 3 days using Power saving mode Fast connect to the internet using eather Wifi or 4GLTE I am still impressed with the Galaxy The phone only gets better each time with newer or upgraded features I really love the capability to video chat Uncle Samsung wants you Samsung the bluesNot  on the new Blu phone you could say Samsung blue everybody wants one kind of a takeoff on a Neil Diamond song entitled song sung Blue Samsung Like a Rockstar Samsung like a pro You can worry about paying me royalties later Traded in my Note 4 and wasnt sure about the smaller screen Screen size seems to be okay Other than that this phone is AWESOME The new Samsung Qalaxy S7 hasnt dissapointed me I love it and it is what I expected in the features I love this phone has the right size and memory I can do everything from this phone as a lap top A few of the old tones arent here and a little hard to transfer certian things over All in all I am very happy with it This phone is amazing I have owned every Galaxy phone since the S4 and they hit the nail on the head with this one It does everything I would ever want from a cell phone and more Its the perfect cell phone well done Samsung this phone is amazing it does so much and is so fast if you need a reliable phone this is the one you need it connects to everything with no problem it has apps for everyday use android pay is awesome feature the phone can be just as secure as you want it the camera is amazing my wife tries to use it all the time Great smartphone love it There is nothing I dont like about my Samsung Galaxy s7 I had issues and still do with my Google Play and Samsung Milk and am on my second device Nonetheless as i am learning all the cool features it has i am overall satisfied I enjoy the slip screen function of course i love the selfie flash and i enjoy the short cuts of the side panel Why wouldnt you get an s7 I love it and the features are great  Upgraded from S4 so of course I like it I wanted to upgrade when S6 came out but I didnt like that it didnt have an SD card slot 

The camera on the S7 is the best out there on a phone I wish it had a 23 option

Games drain the battery only good for 13 day before needing a charge but I am playing games that burn it fast If you dont use your phone for games it would easily last all day

Waterproofing is a nice option havent found time to pour a bottle of champagne on it 

I wish the open program button was still a menu button Ill eventually condition myself to its use 

Wish it still had an IR port for using it as a remote control for the 3 times I need it at hotels a year 

Speaker is loud and music sounds good even if you dont have an external speaker 

Spent money on a tempered glass screen protector IT DIDNT COVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN Even though I do not have the Edge the regular S7 has a slight curve near the sides This design makes it difficult to have tempered glass cover the screen I bought a cheaper gel protector to replace the tempered glass protector and I like it better only because it covers the whole screen 

I wish power saving mode wasnt emergency power It would be nice to have an option between full power and emergency power 

Overall great phone Im glad I waited for it Very easy to activate and port over everything from my previous Galaxy S4 I like the storage available in the phone and with the miniSD card and the miniSD card is easier to install than it was in previous models My old phones battery was shot and I decided to upgrade Wow There is always a learning curve involved but this has been a very easy transition I feel I am almost up to speed already and it has only been a couple of weeks I went from a note 5 to my s7I LOVE IT very sleek design lots of new features and they are easy to maneuver I absolutely love the water resistant feature If it senses any moisture in the charging port it wont chargescared me for a second but after I read about it I felt so much better started charging after a couple hours Best phone Ive had so far I love the phone
It is responsive has more memory great images and interface
The only con is that I like to use a screen cover and so far I have not found a screen cover to work for the whole screen Was a longtime Samsung user and went to another brand for a year and am glad to be back This phone is great Fast sleek design although I am not a huge fan of the glass back and excellent battery life Was worried about the lack of removable battery but this far it had not been an issue Its definitely fastupdated with the latest technology to make it your 1 assistant The edge actually make it easier to get to my important features in seconds The handle of it is easy I can both thumbs without misspelling Im satisfied Easy to set up and take advantage of the features it offer including Samsung apps At first I was unsure of making the change As soon as I held it in my hand I knew it was an awesome decision The S7 Edge looks amazing and feels sleek Love the features Love how fast it is The pictures have real color I traded up from my old S5 Galaxy What a difference I love this new phone The speed is impressive and the display is amazing It has probably the best camera I have ever used I am so glad I upgraded 1 Fast charging pauses all the time when on the wireless fast charger Very annoying 

2 The edge is really a waste not enough apps for it and those that are there cost more money This is the best phone I ever had Better than I phone and my old galaxy 4 This my 3rd Samsung phone I love it I upgraded from an S3 so it is quite an improvement Larger screen and much faster too I love my Samsung s7 It is incredibly quick the apps are great and it is super user friendly I love the free themes that you can get too Design quality and performance are definitely better than past galaxy s phones and surpass iPhone in every way Its probably too large of a device for me Im coming from a Samsung Galaxy III that I absolutely loved and thought it was time for an upgrade I find this thing just way too big to carry put in my pants pocket or in my shirt pocket Too big I maintain almost 250 cell phones as part of my job and I always get Samsung phones The S7 is the best This is the best cell phone I have owned yet I thought the Galaxy S4 was great but this phone is far greater than the S4 It is fast the display is crystal clear its water resistant easy to hold rounded edges expandable storage and I really like the Apps Edge feature so you can multi task easily I say you all have outdone yourselves this time i really cant say much bad about this phone i switched from an iPhone and was scared of what i would get on the other side of the fence i was shocked to see how much i loved it transition was easy and i have so many options that apple just didnt even offer only real complain is the preset apps that you cant delete especially mirrorlink great idea if it worked these things wouldnt be an issue if i could delete them but they seem to keep wanting to take over the phone i make it sound worse then it is just annoys me every now and then This is what we can call a premium quality phone The s7 edge is an amazing phone a 55 inch screen perfectly embedded in a compact body without affecting the looks Very light weight amazing battery life and an awesome camera the edge screen perfectly curves and gives an great experience while playing games or watching videos or even reading news articles I recently upgraded from the Samsung s6 Edge to the S7 Edge The most impressive thing about this phone is the battery life Its such a huge upgrade over the 6 Also the camera takes awesome pictures especially with the active picture technology The phone since the last update has had Bluetooth connectivity issues Other than that it is a beautifully designed phone I upgraded from the S5 and am glad I did I loved my S5 too but Samsung just keeps getting better The camera is awesome and the builtin wireless charging plus waterproofing is great One of the best things unlike the S5 is that the touchscreen works just fine with water droplets on the screen I havent tested it completely underwater yet though This is my first Samsung smartphone so I have visited stores and read up on magazines about the older products Galaxy S5  S6 When the S7 was announced I took a plunge and decided to buy I was pleasantly surprised The product was very well built and beautiful to look at The processor Snapdragon 820 is very fast My wife has a i6 from work and comparing both side by side I can tell that this S7 completely overwhelm the i6 without a doubt

Outside of the processor the microSD addition is so well thought out The camera is great and sharp The graphics is fast In all the features added in this phone are well appreciated and stand above the rest I only wish it has better speakers with better sound thats why I rated 4 stars for Features

Overall a great product Congratulations to the Samsung team for a job well done I purchased this phone as an early upgrade And I love it It does everything imaginable and more

It was between this S7 Edge phone or an S6 IPhone and I thought for two weeks about which one I was wanting leaning more toward the IPhone But then a Sales Rep said one thing to change my mind With the IPhone you are stuck with just IPhone apps or what IPhone allows you to use But with the S7 Edge being Android you have a more versatile phone Which I knew to be true because all Ive ever had was Android phones

The decision was after the comment from the Rep and I would change a thing I love this new phone it does more than I could ever have imagined I wouldnt change a thing about my choice

Yes I would recommend this phone to EVERYONE I waited for this to come out skipping the S6 and it was such a good move I love this phone Crystal clear photos excellent videos and its so fast The wifi antenna isnt as strong but its a small payoff Had to try out a Samsung phone since Ive never had one and always like testing out new products before forming an opinion Although this phone does come with a lot of bloatware installed can we please stop doing this its an incredibly powerful phone and the design is just beautiful

Pluses
 Best camera on the market
 Fastest processor on the market
 Expandable memory SD card and waterproof  Samsung listens to their customers

Could be better
 Battery life although I think this is a marshmellow bug not samsungs fault
 Speakers  I guess this was a sacrifice for the waterproof feature though and bluetooth speakers are so cheap these days whatever if I really need it I can get one of those
 Back glass panel  this is my biggest qualm this phone is WAY too fragile This product is everything that you are looking for in a phone This phone is the future and will make you forget about the past It has everything a person needs to get you throughout the day and make you sleep in tomorrow Only problem with this device is that the Verizon text application doesnt work properly It continues to go into driving mode while sitting at home or work I have had to remove it  So I have to use a different application to text and images not happy with itI liked the version application

Please fix this problem soon  I upgraded from a G3 to the S7 Edge  have zero regrets The speed is amazing  the battery life is incredible Transferring my apps  content was simple  quick using the supplied usb connector  Switch app I couldnt be happier with this purchase I loved my 5 and my 6 but the s7 edge is amazing Samsung makes the best phones on the planet and I love my s camera cant wait to get the hear 2 Been waiting for awhile to upgrade from my Galaxy 4 miniand now Im happy that I had to wait
I love my Galaxy S7 I am still learning the ins  outs but so enjoy all the features that are available I really think Samsung nailed this design SO COMFORTABLE Also very impressed with the camera in my opinion it blows most other phones out of the water I also feel very safe as it is water resistant and feels premium The buttons very sleek love it Overall I think this device is the best I have used ever Definitely will recommend to anyone looking for a new phone Samsung pay is absolutely awesome Light weight and virtually water proof This phone is always turning heads It looks good feels good in the hand its functional and overall its the best phone that I have ever had Definitely worth the buy I feel like a kid on Christmas I love my new S7 Great features and over the top camera This is my first Galaxy since the S3 and Im more than impressed with this device and its features Super fast great camera and the Google apps amaze me daily The sleek design and powerful prosesser make this phone ideal for me the great graphics dont disapoint ether if im not playing a game or listening to pandora I use the phone for cad drawings when i am away from my computer this phone doesnt lag one bit keeps up with every command im not used to that my last phone was a htc m8 and i could make a cup of coffee while waiting for it to load my cad drawings i do not have to wait at all for my s7 the only con i can come up with for this phone is i cant control my TV anymore   guess i will have to find the tv remote not a big deal This is an amazing upgrade from my previous Samsung smartphone it is capable of doing what I need to do from my programming homework to my hobbys of taking nice crisp photos it can handle what I need it to do performance wise this phone is top of the line and its design is quite beautiful that I barely want to touch it bare Ive been a Samsung Galaxy fan since I first borrowed an S3 from my roommate when my old iphone4 decided it didnt want to run right after an update After using his S3 I immediately went and upgraded on my own plan and got the S4 and loved everything about it It was incredibly fast and the brilliant design decision to leave the Android operating system open to tinker with as users see fit is my favorite thing about these phones My new Galaxy S7 is the fastest one yet whether switching between apps or searching the Internet and the battery life has much improved over the previous gen which was already satisfactory so I can play games on my various emulators all day without worry And when the battery does drain full charge takes way less than two hours From the styling to the battery life this phone outshines every phone ive ever owned  It feels soild and has the ability to handle a full days work with power to spare Definitely one of the best cell phones I have had I love it Ive had the S4 thru S7 and this is by far my favorite Bringing back waterproof and SD card features was a huge plus Also better battery great Overall great phone This is by far the best Samsung phone I have own and Im a galaxy man can wait to see whatsome next on the lineup Was time for up grade and had s5 so definitely was looking forward to the new one Far exceeded by expectation and wood definitely recommend it to anyone This is the best smart phone Ive ever used The camera allows me to leave my fancy DSLRS at home when I want to travel light and still get great pictures I love the design look feel and function The display is amazing Simply the best However the speakers awful The ease of use and functionality of the galaxy s 7 lend themselves to an amazing machine Best samsung yet I just love all the features about my new Samsung Galaxy Edge 7 The pictures are my favorite They turn out so beautiful Make me feel like Im a professional photographer Great features Helps in business and personal life After a little problem more I think with me understanding this phone it is great Smart design great speed easy navigation and so much more Totally love this new phone Phone works in areas that other phones do not It even beat my Note 4 in coverage areas I am a die hard Samsung fan and I just have to say that this one is a keeper The camera is better than the previous phone that I had The pictures are crystal clear When it comes to video its like Im watching it on a TV just in a smaller version Netflix and YouTube come in so clear and the speakers are phenomenal I love my phone I cant leave the house without it I love the edge features It makes everything so much easier I can find apps a lot faster I just bought this last week and absolutely love it I got a black one and got a gold color one for my son and he loves it too I think gold color phone looks a bit more elegant had the S4 for 2 years and upgraded to this I love the fact that they put the speaker on the side next to charging port on S7 Crystal clear pics and display amazing phone stylish fast i am using samsung galaxy since samsung released S2 and then s3 s4 s5 s6 edge and now s7 edgeits blown away my mind and thanks samsung to bringing back the SD card slot its worth every penny its like million dollar wealth camera is on the peak the screen us clear and brightdefinitely recommend it The design is beautifull protecting is not cases for it dont protect the screen enough and then take away from its elegance and theres no screen protector that works worth a darn so u are stuck in fear and I feel samsung needs to adress the issue with its own properly designed screen protection amazing phone easy to use best phone in the world First off I didnt want to get a new phone My wife saw a really good deal on getting two s7 or s7 Edge so she got a s7 and I got the s7Edge This phone is Amazing The screen is by far the best I have seen The camera takes incredible pictures and the phone is really quick and snappy I have had this phone for over a month now and it hasnt slowed down The most impressive thing about this phone has to be the battery life I am a fairly heavy user so I run the battery down pretty quick I can only count two days that I had to charge my phone during the day Every other day I dont charge the phone until I got to bed If I had to say any cons about this phone they would have to be it is slippery and that the edge screen can accidentally be pressed Getting a case solved both of these problems Lastly I am not a huge fan of the look of TouchWiz I prefer the more stock look of Android but the themes are nice to have and the good lock app is getting better It has a great camera and battery life And I like the bright lighting and background design and the processor is a lot faster then the old one I love Samsung products the galaxy series is the best i have had samsung in all but one of my phones and i have to say this is the best one yet If you dont have a Samsung then get one because there is no other way to go If you have an iphone do the smart switch and get you a galaxy This phone has a lot of great features that come with it The audio for making calls either speaker or through the earpiece is mind blowing clear Battery life is great Was a little skeptical without the removable battery but has not presented a problem yet I would definitely recommend this to a friend I upgraded from my S5 and this S7 has been awesome I love all the new features especially the improved camera It takes much faster and clearer photos The finger print reader is easier to use The phone itself operates so much faster Downloading apps have become much faster The speed of the phone overall is extraordinary My timing was finally right to get the newest phone on the market Had the s5 for the past couple years and that one converted me from Istuff This s7 is cooler faster more packed with features and its better than my sons phone HA I like this new phone Big change from the G3 to the S7 definitely worth it Better than the old phone super high tech future stuff here I love my galaxy 7 Its easy to use and great design I love this phone All the features and easy access to all my important stuff The battery life is the best and the VR is wow I would totally recommend this phone and I have I have had good eexperance with my 7 edge I am still learning new things on the phone everyday Im a big galaxy fan Ive used iPhone before but I never liked it Then I got a galaxy and since then I feel more comfortable and I get more freedom on my own phone Its a great phone Went from a Note 4 to s7 Is a bit smaller but very powerful Great overall phone Thank you for bringing the external SD card back Coming from a galaxy s5 to a galaxy s7 was life changing for the better I like the curve and the previews of my text messages on the edge of the phone I like the picture quality I loved how they transfered all my information from my old phone to this new phone That is pretty neat I also love the color Im loving this phone I love the new Samsung Galaxy s7 Its waterproof and takes amazing pictures every time I had friends who have own iphones all their lives and they see my s7 they immediately love it Also I get to upgrade to the s8 when it comes out and I dont have to pay off my s7 with the Samsung forever plan This is an awesome phone and I wouldnt trade it for anything I love the galaxy phones I had the S6 before this and loved that one as well Love how I can customize it to me and not just everything being so stock set 10 out of 10 in my book I recommend my family and friends to get a Galaxy s7 Its an amazing phone I have always been a Samsung fan but one of the reasons for that has been expandable storage which this phone has AND a removable battery which the have gotten rid of The processor of this product is faster than its previous predecessors Feels good while holding fast phone and great camera This phone has great battery life and performsbetter than all my previous versions I was happy with my Galaxy S5 Upgraded to the S7 for the camera We had a scheduled trip to a famous amusement park I wanted the increased camera performance of the S7 I no longer carry an SLR or Point  Shoot For outside shots my previous S5 was great The S7 takes great low light shots The camera launcher is very quick The low level picture and video quality is very good I took video of the night time events at a famous Amusement Park Video Recording was shot in 1080p Video looks great on my Samsung TV 

The high speed wireless charging also works very well I would like to see mobile high speed wireless charging Im stuck with low speed wireless charging when in the vehicle Samsung Pay also works Battery life is really good Wife and I each had about 50 battery life left at the end of the day after taking pictures video and checking the Amusement Park app throughout the day This was from 7am to 11pm battery life Very happy to avoid the shame of Wall Hugging

The S7 Bluetooth call quality is very good However the S7 is not happy when switching between bluetooth devices throughout the day My S5 never complained Data transfer using wifi direct from S7 to S5S3 works great The S7 also allows picture folder creation straight to the memory card Something the S5 would never allow 

While at the Amusement Park there was an area guaranteed to get wet Didnt faze the S7 I kept recording while other manufacture phones had to be hidden Very happy with the phone I got my phone this afternoon and Im loving all the features and love how easy it was to switch phones will recommend to anyone Overall the phone is nice The only gripe is about the sides When holding with one hand the side of my hand sometimes hits the edge Ive had this phone for a month or so now and I love it I had the S5 and loved that phone but the S7edge is so much better More features note options And of course bigger scree sound is definitely louder with the speaker on the bottom I thought it was going to be a problem with the screen breaking but its even better than I thought Honestly I have dropped it twice already and still not a scratch on it I was sure it would break because the salesman said the edge screen is a little more sensitive Im happy to say no problems at all I truly love this phone I would recommend this phone I love it Nice design features I am lucky to get 7 to 8 hours of battery life daily Down to 65 after 3 hours This is one of the fastest best phone out right now It is a really good device It works quickly and has really nice features The design is very sleek and looks awesome Love my phone I have been an iPhone user for some time now and switched recently to samsung and I must admit I love the phone It has great features and very easy to use I love that you can customize so much of her phone to what suits you best I will definitely stay with Samsung long term Very happy I switched When I first watched the reveal of the S7 Edge I knew something was special about it I came over from the note series previously owning the note 4 While I feel in love with the SPen mostly the screen cutting feature The edge on the S7 proves useful as well I love everything about this device The design is beautiful the software is amazingly optimized and the water resistant feature is super great especially with kids around I love this device and if I had my choice of any smartphone on the market today I would choose it again Very impressed with the phones features and also the new SD card for more storage I upgraded from another brand and boy am I glad I did After much research and time I finally decided on the Galaxy S7 I could not be happier with my choice I feel like I have finally moved into the 21st century Had a Galaxy S4 Active for two years Replaced this phone when charging port failed Not a good design in the S4 Made sure the S7 had at least the same features It does and more The new camera is great The readdition of the micro SD card slot was a wise move I would not have purchased this phone if it had been continued to left out Have had phone about 3 weeks All great The camera has such clarity It almost feels like I could reach out and touch whatever it is important looking at It also has some many more features than my G5  It is an excellent device wonderful pictures 
Music is my life and the sound quality is off the charts Speaker arent needed 
The processor is faster than my computer Its the best thing out there I use it for games music and when I talk I tend to be long winded and even the battery stands up to my activities Overall I will give it a five star rating

GREAT SMARTPHONE CHOICE Love It  I upgraded from an S4 and its such a huge difference I love the overall performance and design I would recommend the Galaxy s7 edge to anybody who wants a modern phone with the best features and performance This is the phone that should have came after the s5 Only cons is the adoptable storage This by far is my best phone ever with crystal clear camera shots of fire works and all of my kids action shots I love the speed and design of the phone also It will be hard to ever trade up for this phone in the future I love the phone so far works perfectly and the display is absolutely beautiful Performance and cameras are great and touchwiz is much better than its given credit for Unfortunately the phone is so thin and the display curves in such a way that it cracked very easily the first time I dropped it I purchased a replacement that is great another S7 edge but that is something to keep an eye out for This phone does it all from multi tasking to taking great photos I went from using a note 3 to this phone and no complaints The quad hd display is amazing Thank you samsung I have recently got this phone and enjoy it I find it simple to use I have been a huge Galaxy fan for years Ive owned several Galaxy devices s3 s5 active and now the s7 The Galaxy S7 runs super fast I was so surprised at how fast the processor was Apps download in seconds The design is amazing I absolutely love the look and feel of this phone I was torn between getting the S7 and S7Edge I ultimately chose the S7 because I liked the sleek look Dont get me wrong the Edges design is great as well I just wanted a smaller phone The pictures I have taken with this phone look amazing Crystal clear picture no matter what I am viewing The graphics are amazing as well I just love everything about this phone I am so glad that it has expandable memory although I have yet to even need it and Ive downloaded tons of apps and have taken plenty of pictures I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to get an upgrade This phone is truly the best phone I have seen by far Great phone love the look and feel Glad you brought back expandible memory Could use front facing and bigger speakers I love my s7 wouldnt trade it for anything at the moment I love that the SD memory slot is back I love how smooth it is I love EVERYTHING ABOUT this phonesamsung products are the best Ive had a Galaxy S4 and a Galaxy S6 before this phone and always loved them But this by far is the best The curved edges on the back of the phone make for a sleek feel The camera is great and super fast Great features looks and performance 5 stars all around Another great product from Samsung Sleek and powerful This phone does everything Ive come to expect from Samsung Galaxy Thankso for bringing back removable memory I put a screen protector on mine and now the sensitivity of the touch screen has lowered The screen sensitivity option is not a part of the settings on this phone as it was with the s5 The s5 had more options than the s7
I believe this phone is just filled bells and whistles to make people go ooo and aaaah over to compensate for how bad it really is I would not recommend this product to anyone Love this Galaxy S7 phone I am still learning but would not go to another phone My son and I took the S5 on our AT thru hike last year We took two batteries The S5 was okay but it didnt hold charges for a long time 35 days between town stops This phone has great power usage It was more expensive than other phones I considered but I think it will be worth it The sound is improved as well as the display The Samsung is lighter than other options I considered as well Love love  love the phone so glad I got it so excited when I got it I had the s5 for 3 yearsand now I got the s7 and I live it With 2 young children constantly grabbing my phone Im at peace finally with the water resistance and the ease of a light case on it 

Im also loving the feature with Samsung pay Its great being able to pay with your phone and not have to carry around all your cards I have had a Galaxy since the S3 This is the best phone on the market The camera is superb that makes taking pictures  videos easily with the greatest quality The processor makes the phone fast  incredibly reliable Very happy with my new phone Upgraded from the Galaxy s5 great products hope to get the same out of the galaxy s7 as I did with the s5 Great phone all around the only things I would change is waterproofing vs the current water resistance phone is a bit slippery there is way too much bloatware and Samsung uses the same exact icons as Google so it can be difficult to tell the difference Definitely is not gold like in the description I got the black one but I love that the SD card port is back I missed it with the s6 Only thing Im not really a fan of is the fact that its not compatible with the peel remote app anymore Other than that it is a very nice phone Smaller in size easier to read faster more reliable What more could you ask for well of course a removable battery but with the new Android I see this as a nonissue 

Improved finger print ready actually reads and doesnt go into spaztic mode

Removable Media  expandablePERFECT Water Proof too What were you thinking taking that away from us

It actually works as a phone too

The Samsung pay if really cool much wider support of banks that google pay

Photos are amazing

I was expecting mindblowing performance instead I only get mindnumbing From the ability to use Samsung Pay to the SHealth app this phone has it all It can take your pulse and tell you your pulse oxygen level and even tell you how much stress your carrying around it has an amazing camera that is extremely fast and dependable Its truly an amazing phone Waited a week before I wrote this review I upgraded from an S6 so didnt see too many changes but still all in all a great phone that I am very happy with Glad Samsung came back with it being water resistant and SD slot Switched to the GS7 from a Lumia ICON I couldnt resist the great design stellar battery life water resistance micro SD fast charging Samsung Pay is awesome did I mention beautiful design Since Windows Phone is all but dead this phone pushed me over the top to switch I love the tile interface  dark theme so I loaded a windows launcher  dark theme  couldnt be happier By far the best phone Ive ever had Quickand easy to use Large screen but compact phone to fit in pocket This is the best phone I have ever had It is so much easier to use than the iPhone Camera is awesome 
Screen is awesome 
Response is awesome 
Everything works flawlessly I have been using the note 3 traded it in on yhe s7 edge and iam glad i did fit perect in my hands love the new features as well And the display is awsome With the water proofing dust proofing micro sd support as well as the low light camera this is the new bar for what Android phones should be The display camera and edge display are my favorite features on the phone This phones battery is real good also like how fast it charges Best phone ever The phone is fast despite lacking an ir blaster The expandable storage is great The screen is crisp and sharp I absolutely love my phone I previously owned the Samsung S6 which was a great phone I decided to upgrade due to the changesame made on the S7 which were appealing to me I love the camera the water resistant design and the expandable memory The battery life if is better than the S6 I do a lot of traveling while Im off work and use my phone for everything It has replaced my laptop which has simplified my life Not everyone thinks that a larger phonelarger screen is better And for those of us who still like to have a phone that can be easily used with one hand and does not feel like youre holding a brickTM then the Galaxy S7 is that phone Blistering fast performance slick and elegant design superior battery life and wireless charging this is the stuff the dreams are made of Samsung has delivered THE phone to beat and set a new bar for others to aim for Add to all of this crisp and clear HD calling Verizon Credit Card magnetic swipe capability and a camera that just takes great pictures all the time and you have a monster of a phone in your hands I feel like Im dreaming Samsungs best phone yet As always the go above and beyond Ive owned nothing but Samsung Galaxy and over all I think the S7 is the best The pictures are crystal clear Its one of the best phones by Samsung in my opinion I can have a slew of apps going an den no lag Love my new phone I love my phone It is easy to use and many useful features This is by far the best phone I have had I would highly recommend this phone to everyone I am very satisfied Other than the milk music app which doesnt let me play a whole song I have no complaints I love my phone Everything is an upgrade from where I was at a month ago No complaints whatsoever Keep it up Samsung I love how easy it was to transfer photos apps contacts from my old phone It was a seamless transition that increased my love for the Samsung brand The edge functions also make it easy to access contacts and apps that I use frequently Love the sleek design Very appealing to the eye Love this phone its best phone I have owned to date This is absolutely the best phone I have ever owned It is extremely easy to operate and Im still learning functions that I didnt even know existed A must buy for anyone I enjoy the Samsung Galaxy S7 and many of the features The camera is high quality the display is rich and the speed is excellent I have hit a glitch where the display went black until I did a forced hard reset but other than that its a worthy phone The Samsung S7 Edge is packed full of features great performance best camera I have ever had in a phone great picture A little expensive In all this is the best phone I have ever had and Im sold on the Samsung band The Galaxy s7 edge comes with a fantastic camera and one of the best if not the best display I have ever seen on a phone An overall phenomenal phone I could not be happier with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Every time I get on my on my phone my friends are impressed with it It has done everything I hoped it would and then some My Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has met and exceeded my expectations Works very well longer lasting battery than our s5s several better working features faster and easier to use works nice some apps are easier to to work with than our old s5 overall very nice The S7 not the edge has a very sleek and quality feel to it but some at the changes are a bit irritating For instance the phone doesnt come with a basic music player other than the Google bloatware Also there have been done limits to personalization features Lastly the screen is curved a bit but at this time there are no screen protectors that fit the whole screen without lifting from the curved edge 
Nevertheless this phone has awesome functionality and processing I use it without any issues with the Samsung oculus which is amazing Great looking phone Works well Fast good storage and very light I dont like the screen because the edges are veveled and screen protectors dont adhere well I wish it came in more colors Coming from a S4 the Galaxy S7 has a lot of upgrades Great screen resolution faster speed larger screen better design They also brought back the external memory card drive which is something I didnt want to give up with my S4 The battery life also seems longer Overall the S7 was worth the wait and the upgrade This is the first phone Ive ever purchased on release day and I have no regrets I moved from an S3 to an S7 The advance was phenomenal in just about every way I am obviously still learning my phone Trying to learn a new phone usually is a real downer but the new features on S7 cause me to look forward to what else is new I really love my new phone The Galaxy S7 is the best smart phone that I have ever used The slight curve on the screen makes it the most beautiful as well The performance on it is great and I couldnt have asked for anything more 

My old S4 mini was a joke compared to this I love the phone It is everything I had hoped for I do wish it had more internal storage this wasnt an option It does freeze for a few seconds when I send a text message which is frustrating Witty a case it is tough to hold securely and not touch the edges I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7edge and it surpasses my expectations This can probably be the best phone I have owned and the best out on the market right now The edge screen is sexy  and so is the phone I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge I love the features and that it is water resistant Hands down one of the best if not THE best cellphone of 2016 Screen  great loudness  great sdcard expandible  super great 2 hang upsremoved IR feature i love being able to control any tv anywhere I went luckily i have gear2 watch and other hangup is edge  either i have big hands and press things by mistake or I dont know how to use edge function Other than that superb snappy machine that takes amazing photos and video I absolutely love this phone I had the S4 and was really not sure if I wanted to upgrade since there was nothing wrong with it But Im sure glad I did it was a great decision I have not found anything that I do not like about this phone I love the look and feel of this phone The photos that I take are crisp and beautiful The display is also very reactive to my touch I love it i love this galaxy the video like soo good is great product I love my Samsung Galaxy 7 Easy to use perfect size and shape Durable easy to read easy to set up Excellent features I love my S7 edge The features are really fun to learn and use It is just a great phone to have for working or playing I love the quality of the phone calls The calls are very clear The camera is very nice too Overall the phone is simple to use As an owner sincejas the S3 I have to say Samsung stepped it up with this one The S7 is comfortable in the hand and having the water repellant features is great as most phones on the market hate even a little humidity

Great features and fast and responsive interface A must have for any multitasker Converted from S4 I knew Id be impressed but I was blown away The display is crystal clear Much more battery life than I expected It fits well in my hands and my hands are small Excellent sound quality and I love the fingerprint sensor I love the desing of this product but i think you can make a better desing for your products I dont see to much change between the 6 edge plus and this item Love this phone and it super fast Best Samsung product so far Overall Ive found the S7 Edge to be a excellent buy I previously owned the S4 and in every way the S7 is better Larger brighter screen More memory with a stronger processor Better camera Finger print security Water resistant Louder speaker 
I feel the S7 Edge is an amazing product and would suggest it to anyone looking at phones currently Ive heard people question whether or not to upgrade from the s6 and now that I have done it out laugh at myself for even questioning it In every aspect it is so much better I havnt found anything to complain about The battery is good performance is good software is good I went through 2 of these phones thinking the first one may have been bad or something A phone should be able to be used as a phone Very poor reception dropped calls etc etc This phone has a great new sleek design Can be a bit slippery  recommend a case if you are clumsy like me Very satisfied thus far Dropped the phone in the 3ft deep river for about 30 seconds by accident when found the phone it was still playing music The case on it was very generic Not an issue with the phone works as before Very happy about that knowing that almost any other phone out there would have been a brick after so much water Samsung has taken the S7 and made it their most refined phone yet The build quality is excellent and it feels amazing in your hand I hated putting a case on it Love the reintroduction on the micro SD card slot I love everything about my phone especially the new features and the look as well This phone is really great I like the ultra power saving mode it has i use it whenever i go to work so my battery doesnt die and even without it my battery lasts the whole day I love my new S7 Edge Upgraded from a Samsung Note Edge and wanted a better phone but loved the edge screens and was excited the S7 had that option The Samsung s7 is as easy to use as always but with a better screen and features Why not get a new phone Case closed Not pleased with battery life is not as advertised I got the Samsung Galaxy S7 thinking it was going to be the newest best thing ever and it has a lot of glitches my power button and volume down button quit working Ive gone through two of these phones my girlfriend upgraded from the S4 to the S7 and wishes she hadnt the phone does what it wants to on its own and adds buttons to my home buttons I dont know why I wish they would get them fixed I bought two of these phones last week Im taking both back this afternoon I cant make a call I cant learn to use it since there is no cell service My LG worked for years without dripping one call Nice worthless upgrade Best option is that its water resistant functions well just missing tv remote option Love the phone itself works great and amazing picture quality for those action shots I like my S7 but gave noticed that when I use Iheart radio my phone shuts off and restarts I know this is minor but it is a real pain in the butt when it restarts every few minutes Other then that great phone Go with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Faster smarter for a smartphone right clearer better camera great sounding speaker and last but not least its android so you know you can do a billion more things that you could with an iPhone For the past 8 years I have been a HUGE fan of Samsung everything Samsung Smart 3D TV Got it Samsung Soundbar for the TV Got it Samsung Galaxy Sseries Smart phones Uh yes and have had the S2 S4 nd now the S7 Edge What did I have before that Samsung Mythic Loved it so much that Ive stayed loyal ever since AND I got my wife hooked on them too How about tablets Yep Had the Galaxy Tab 2 until yesterday when I dropped it on my garage floor and the screen shattered Looked up my Square Trade warranty and it had expired on Jan 6th What luck right

Anyway

This phone has virtually EVERYTHING that anyone could ever want in a Smartphone without all of the fluff thats added to other phones to make room for the workhorse performance Samsung literally took all of the grievances that were held with their older models and yes theyve added back in the expandable storage slot and not only fixed them but made them better 

One of my personal peeves was with the cameras shutter speed There was always a lengthy lag before the image could be captured but not on the S7 Its pretty much instantaneous AND they went and added Dual Pixel functionality so all of my photos and videos turn out amazing and never need to be touched up or edited

Battery life I have never been satisfied with battery life on ANY mobile device before Well before NOW Not only is the battery capacity larger theyve figured out how to fully charge your phone when set on the Fast Charging mode and in well under an hour Thats been my experience so far anyway

Oh did I mention that its also drinkable and water splash resistant No more get king your phone wet and putting it in a bag of uncooked rice Just wipe it off and go on with your day

On a side note pun most definitely intended the Edge Panel displays are awesome You can even download for free or purchase different types of panels and add them to the edge display through their Edge Panel store You can also change your phones theme through the Theme Store Both the Edge Panel and Theme Stores are preloaded o to to your phone but you can uninstall them to free up space if youre not into that sort of thing You can also completely disable the edge panel if you so choose See soon to be former iPhone users You have so many ways to truly make your phone personal 

To wrap up the phone is just James Bond cool and everyone thats seen me with it has asked me Is that the phone from the commercial where those guys are pouring water on it I PROUDLY reply Sure is You want to see the edge panel display Theyre really cool

It took me about an hour to write this and when I started my battery was at 86 It JUST dropped to 81 so again pretty awesome I was a little optimistic when moving from an iPhone to the s7 I wasnt sure how I would like the phone overall Ive been impressed It is a little on the touchy side but Im sure there is a setting for that The Vr is one of the great features on why I purchased it My best friend went from an iPhone to an android and my brother is huge on samsung products I figure I would give it a shot I would recommend it to anyone that would move from an iPhone to an android interface I have had the 7 edge for a month now and I would highly recommend any Samsung product to all my friends family and even strangers bc I have nothing but good experience with them and there always very good quality and stylish As a consumer Im always baffled when a company tells me what I can and cannot do with my  thats why I was surprised when with the Galaxy S6 thats exactly what Samsung did No more expansion slot no more extra battery life this is the land of the 55 ounce bladder buster we want more
Samsung has always been a trendsetting company and with the Galaxy S 7 hopefully thats exactly what theyve done again A increase in battery life would be nice but they reintroduction of the 200 gigabyte expansion slot will keep my data usage down and my storage complaints quiet 
I was holding out but when the S7 come out it was time for me to migrate to it from my S4 and the power increases been fantastic
Thanks Samsung for getting back on track Let me start by saying that this is my favorite Samsung to date and Ive only used Samsung for the last three phones There are MAJOR issues with the WiFi I had to get a replacement phone because none of my apps were working when the WiFi was turned on I did some research on my own and discovered that the bluetooth needs to be turned off in order to use the WiFi This is a problem for me because I am a regular user of both features From what I understand via the article I read there will be software updates that will fix this problem Some users have already received them but I guess it goes by who your service provider is to determine when you get the fix I could be wrong about that though
The camera is amazing That being said it freezes ALL THE TIME It also switches from auto to burst mode by itself which is when it freezes the most and you have to exit the camera app to reset itand end up missing great picture opportunities When the camera is working fine the picture quality can NOT be beat Oh the speak to shoot feature doesnt always work either Super cool feature  would be even cooler if it were consistent
The design is gorgeous and honestly not that muck bigger than the S6
The last problem with this phone is the battery life Mine decreases by a minimum of 10 per hour even is all apps are closed and I am not using my phone For some reason that no one has been able to figure out yet the Android System is using anywhere from 35 to 47 of my battery For this reason alone I am considering a different phone Im giving it another week though because I truly love everything else about this phone The edge bar added storage and other cool features are ALMOST worth the hassle of dealing with the battery and WiFi
A side note and this could just be because I use my phone for music so much the speakers are really great Im still holding out hope that Samsung will put in quality speakers one day so I dont always have to hook my phone up to portable speakers to use it I am still in the indoctrination process but I like what I am learning I had the Samsung Galaxy S6 and that phone was very good note good But this phone runs way more smoothly and efficiently Simple things to fluid swipes of the finger to launching and relaunching application is easy and very smooth with the S7 The added water resistant effect is brilliant Way to go Samsung Love my new s7 edge My s6 edge had an overheating problem so I upgraded to the s7 what a difference Stays cool battery life is awesome and I love the always on clock Only complaint is not having the built in IR blaster I am an install tech and work with a lot of different tvs and miss having the IR blaster Still give 5 stars for another excellent device by Samsung Amazing phone Samsung never ceases to amaze me in their innovationhowever I am amazed at the S7 Samsung packs a device with a full array of features and makes is sexy as can be not to mention water resistant and a SD Card slot Samsung has done it againthis is why I AM A SAMSUNG JUNKIE This phone is truly a great feat in the world of technology I love the design fits well in hand games work great but I really feel like the ir blaster should have been included in frequently loose my remote to my TV the s6 active comes equipped with this feature and was very helpful but now I switched to the s7 and I have to search up and down for my remote so I can select a program for my children I belive the ir blaster should be included in every with an ir blaster your never with out a remote they come in handy any ware there is a ir receptor Great features and sleek design Perfect size still learning so much about this phone I really like the 7 edge The battery life is amazing i love that i can manage multiple apps at once and surf the web with great speeds Two thumbs up No complaints at all While my LG took great pictures the people I spoke to no matter where in the country they were had trouble hearing me Not sure if it was the phone or the carrier but I decided to change both and I am not disappointed The new phone is great A few glitches here and there some of the keys on the edge of screen eg P L Q A need to be hit a few times the battery isnt as great as I had hoped but the Fast Charge makes up for that In the beginning I had an issue with transferring all my things from my LG to my Samsung mainly my music but after a quick internet search it was a breeze

If not for the battery issue I would have given this fivestars The Galaxy S7 Edge is definitely great with the speed Sometime the screen goes black where you need to close the app and go back in The camera is awesome when amazing themes you can choose as well The tab on the side to show you information and you can select your apps is an awesome ideal but I find myself just going to my main menu and opening the apps that way I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family ive lived on Galaxys and they seem to get better and better I am afraid to touch it because of its beauty It leaves fingerprints on it which of course makes me have to clean it constantly Samsung has finally listened to its users and I am more than happy with the touchwiz interface They are also trying some interesting things with the Good Lock interface I LOVE THIS PHONE Happy with it so far but Ive only had it for one day I like how lightweight it is  the display is very bright Thus phone is the best phone Ive ever owned Battery lasts forever and the screen size is great I am loving the S7 I am so glad the SD card and waterproof features are back Both are things that I really love from Samsung The phone display is amazing Everything opens quickly and responds fast The camera is great and taking pictures in low light works very well Im glad I waited to upgrade from my S4 Great features battery life and overall great phone It is faster has a better camera and built in apps I upgraded to the GS7 from the GS5 and the difference is amazing The camera is so much easier to use and takes such incredibly clear pictures The Samsung Gear VR is amazing and all my coworkers take turns watching all the new things that come in I get better reception than any of my other phones wherever I go This phone is awesome i love it i would buy over and over please consider this product Outstanding phone Easy to navigate Beautiful design Bright clear display Best Galaxy yet Great battery life
Great screen
Super fast
Design is amazing
Blows every other phone outta the water For what i do with the phone it works great Watching videos like youtube and anime are amazing with its great definition and good loading speed makes it top of the line With this the camera on the back has to be by far the best ive seen on a phone Gaming is awesome without any lags as of yet However the phone is a fragile and can easily be broken if dropped so a case is need which is an extra expense that comes costly when added to the price of the phone But other than this i give the phone a strong 455 easily and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good technically advanced phone Great looking screen Pretty easy to use Love the HD on calls I owned a Galaxy S5 before I purchased this phone and Im well informed about the Galaxy S6 and its features That being said the S7 incorporates the features that I really liked in the S5 and the S6 and gets rid of the features that I didnt like in the two 

The S7 also brings in some new features of it own some small and some big For example the Always On Display to me is a small addition but one that Im enjoying very much I find myself not having to needlessly turn my screen on when I want to see the time or if I have a message One big addition is the speed of the camera and the phone altogether Thats something I like a lot coming from the S5

Most of these improvements may be subtle but they make me enjoy the phone and produce no complaints which makes me a happy Samsung customer This is the 3rd Galaxy phone I have owned and I love it I moved up to this one because I wanted the newest Galaxy It is easy to use and simple to learn I came from a another phone which I thought was a great phone but this S7 has set the bar in my opinion It is as beautiful as a cellular phone can be and the performance is outstanding Everything happens super fast with very little lag and apps so far are performing wonderfully The battery life is good and the camera is as good if not better than my past favorite mobile phone camera on my previous phone I would definitely recommend Im loving this phone so much it has everything I need to be able to get task done from wherever Im at Samsung is the best for this one I decided to come out of my Note 4 to the S7 Its smaller and easier to carry than my other phone Its not bad except the auto correct is annoying Love this phone I had an s4 and nothing wasnt improved from previous designs I do not miss my HTC phones whatsoever This is definitely the best phone out there right now This phone is my first real phone in almost six years and so far it has been great The large home button functioning as a fingerprinter reader is large enough to not have to search for it and yet small enough not to get in the way The screen is large and bright even on the lowest brightness setting 

The sensitivity of the screen and response time is fantastic and I hardly ever misclick with my thumbs That being said the keyboard can be a bit small it feels I hardly had trouble typing on my Droid X or Moto G but for some reason typing on here seems difficult even with the bigger screen 

The only other downside I have found is when I try to use the power button one handed while my phone is on vibrate I find pushing on the power button with my left thumb while holding it I hit the volume up or down taking it off vibrate or putting it on silent That however may be an issue in conjunction with the Otterbox case its wrapped in

That being said its really the only downsides to this phone After three weeks of use Ive never had to charge it during the day even after heavy texting browsing and general usage The speed charger is great for if you are up late and forget to put it on the charger early 

If you like using the S Health I can say its been much improved over the previous S6 from when I used it on my familys phone Only once or twice did I have issues with it reading from my finger 

All in all its great for a new phone if you want the latest and greatest I opted not to get the edge due to wanting a case that it fits snuggley in Overall the phone is great I have had some technical glitches but thats to b expected with new phones I did an early upgrade and boy am I so happy that I did My old phone was on its last leg and this came at the right time
This phone does wonders compared to my old phone Galaxy S4 So much faster smoother lightweight brighter easier to use etc etc etc
Thank you Samsung for making a great phone Nicest phone I have owned to date Fewer problems than I have had with any phone I constantly have to back out of a message and go to my home screen or flip my phone from vertical to horizontal and back to vertical to finish a message on the keyboard or when the screen has dead spots areaso on the screen that dont work no mathere how many times I tap it certain letters will become unusable and I have to do this to get them to work again it did this from the first day I had it I also cant store music and most of the apps on the SD card A bit frustrating when I can put in a 200gb card but I cant put much on it that defeats the purpose of allowing the expansion The rest is good essay to use camera is awesome I just came from a Sam sung Galaxy S5 and love it and I might go back to it I love this phonebut one thing to watch out for is it charge fast on the wireless charger But any other featcher on this phone is incredible the durability is out standing and ive taking this scuba diving with me and it survived I would highly reccomend this phone to an adventurous person This phone does it all pretty well Looks good good quality overall Strong camera good voice quality strong bluetooth capability good touch screen
Only gripe is the battery doesnt really last All Day as advertised as we use it Loved my S3 until it went swimming 12 feet down and purchased the S7 Love everything about it especially the longer battery life and enhanced camera features Still have more to explore but other than the cost I am really happy with it the Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phoneits blazing fastand is jam packed with amazing and useful featuresthe battery life is greatand its an over all smooth and silky experienceIF you can bypass its really poor designcamerahorrible speakersand really saturated colors Best phone everawesome cameraand easy to use Everything else is joke s7 is the cell to get Dont know why I waited so long to upgrade The camera is amazing and all the new features as well I was asked to buy a warranty for 1 year  or the phone would not be covered after 14 day  except from the 1 yr manufacturer warranty My phone stopped working and over heated within 16 day of owning the phone It is being repaired as we speak I hope they send me a new phone as this one is defaulted Not a good phone I love the gold designlove the quality of the camera and love the phone from every features all the way to the outside The performance is excellent Almost immediately after purchasing there was an Android update which ran quickly with no problems I love everything about it so far Time came for an upgrade to my phone I knew it was going to be a Samsung best phones available in my opinion So I compared numerous versions of the Samsung product line I ultimately decided on the Galaxy S7 Edge and am I ever glad I did Super fast cool design easy functionality and all the other cool features This phone can do more than Ive been able to discover thus far only bought 3 days ago
I very much recommend the S7 Edge This is my second Galaxy S7 Edge I had two lines due for an upgrade so I immediately upgraded to these when they became available Battery life is outstanding features and designs are great has a nice premium feel to it its everything you could want The only thing I wish they carried over from the S5 and S6 was the IR blaster functionality Its not that big of a deal but it did come in handy Im just glad they brought the waterproof and microSD card slot back in this phone Switched from an iPhone and love the Samsung The edge was a little large for me so I traded for a smaller S7 I have used an iPhone all my life and made the switch It was well worth it I have had this phone for not even a month now I bought it brand new after having the Galaxy S5 I used some of my friends Galaxy S6 and thought they were pretty close in specifications Once I bought the phone my friend and I were streaming a movie together and watching it from across the room and my quality off the same WiFi was significantly better Pictures better and the videos run more smoothly then the S6 The camera itself is a huge improvement with quick capture with focused quality Definitely recommend this device This is an amazing phone The camera is absolutely outstanding The speakers are also very loud which is a plus I also love how the fingerprint unlock responds quickly The resolution for videos is also very amazing I love the new curved design very comfortable hold I like this phone better than my s5 active It is a lot thinner and lighter It has a lot more storage on the phone than my s5 had plus you can put a micro SD card and have even more storage space I had several samsung htc and hp smartphones in the past This offers the best set of features for me I am impressed with the battery life The combination with Gear VR is impressive I love the return of microSD card and waterproof Everyone I show this phone to buys one and the vr goggles The wifi connection on this is trying to get the best connection and at 2 signal bars it slows down disconnects entirely cause on my old phone a Samsung galaxy S5  the wifi has no issues Love the phone but only had it fours days and it got cracked when it slid out of my hands I have had my S7 Edge for about 3 weeks and I love it I moved from a Note 4 and prior to that had an HTC One M8 I love the smaller overall size compared to my previous phones while keeping same relative screen size The display camera and features are awesome I love the wireless charging and I find the edge display very useful Bought this less than a week and there is a black spot on my camera it is not dust The circle is like a black smear and goes off and on Since the phantom circle only appears when it wants the retailer wont let me replace it because he needs hard evidence This defect seems to be shy once i step into a Verizon store
Waterproof   so far it is fair I have to play music loud for the water can get out of the speaker and once again it can sound ok
Dissapointed that the Tempered glass doesnt cover the full screen of the Samsung s7 oh and it heats up in 1 hour but my girlfriends phones she can use it all day and it is cool
So far i am dissapointed with this purchase specially being new to Verizon No but really it is better than sliced bread also if I forgot to mention this phone is the best phone on the market Im hoping this review helps iPhone people looking to switch to the darkside Ive been one of those people for a few years now Ive got bored Tried LG MOTO X HTC M8 BLACKBERRY and now SAMSUNG S7 Gorgeous phone Bad battery Must be charged every single day and Im not even on my phone all day Too much of a hassle to find settings that should be simple to find People like to say that iPhone people are dumb just because they want the user experience to be easy Not true If you dont mind a reboot every now and then or have to uninstall an app because it makes the phone run slow or drains battery but have a more vivid display and quicker camera android is for you If you care about themes and fonts more than reliability with apps and Bluetooth android is for you You just want something that works and the battery is pretty darn good and its very reliable and you never have to worry about it not working I would go with an iPhone Tip to iPhone people research how to get the most out of the battery If you do the right stuff its great Both are great just for different people So far after getting this phone have been very pleased with its overall use The battery still drains very quickly so thats definitely not a perk Its pretty sensitive to the touch I like it alot but would like it if when it says longer battery life they actually mean it I went from the note 3 to the edge 7 and it was the best move for me I love the camera features it takes great pictures and I dont have to worry about someone spilling something on my phone or one of the kids dropping it in the pool when they take pictures I couldnt be more satisfied with this phone This phone is light with a big screen The system is quick and the OS is intuitive Smaller than a tablet yet packed with features of a laptop The camera is crisp and the screen is very clear Great added features and apps This phone is like having everything you need in your pocket Pretty much is a replacement for your laptop and tablet I would say they Samsung thought about pretty much everything The only problem I have is that you dont seem to be able to adjust the touch screen sensitivity Although I was told it is a known issue and will be fixed in the near future I love this phone works great I have not yet begun to tap into its full capabilities I would like to see less adds pop up I had a Samsung s6 as my last phone I didnt think there would be much of a difference between the s6 and s7 But boy was I mistaking This S7 by far is the best phone is have ever had Just everything about the phone is good the color the size I would definitely recommend this phone so glad I bought it The S7 edge is the best phone i have ever purchased All of the fearures are great The resolution on the screen is awsome I havent had it 2 weeks yet and I like it The camera is great and all the features It is replacing my phone and Jet Pack I dont need both when one does both functions and more I am also freed from the laptop because I can do most anything on the Galaxy S7 Also I can do things the laptop cant do Takes the best pictures I have ever seeneed from a phone I upgraded from the Note 4 to the S7 Edge and the experience left me at a loss for words This from a user who was VERY satisfied with the Note 4 and have been blown away with the S7 The design is excellent it feels very comfortable in my hands and the colors on the screen leap out when viewing I love how I can watch videos with the same quality as I do my television and I have enjoyed the battery life that seems to last longer than with my Note There are just too many features to list but everything from the audio how effortlessly I can upload videos through my computer to how I can use it as a remote for my TVs this truly is hands down the best smartphone I have ever owned I am really amazed I love this phone I love everything about it The graphics are great and I love its water proof And I love Gold I was the proud owner of a s5 and very happy with itthat I decided to skip on the s6 However when tthe s7came out I was intrigued and decided to upgrade One thing that disappointed though was the missing IR I love my new phone It is taking some time to learn where everything is I had a s4 but I really like the new features It runs fast has a good lasting battery and is water resistant  Ive only the Samsung Galaxy S7 for one week but I love it already The camera takes great low light pictures and the screen is so vivid I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends Less hang ups than my iPhone 6 Easy drag and drop interface the voice to text commands are a bit iffy but I enjoy this phone i was under the impression that the phone had some impact durability and the Gorilla Glass they tout would hold up but within 2 weeks of ownership i walked into a stairwell with the phone in my pocket and the screen cracked cant tell you how disappointed i was the phone is still working and im still using it but i have wrapped it in packing tape and wonder how long it can hold up The Galaxy S7 Edge is a beautiful devise it feels good in your hand the screen is perfect and smooth This is my first galaxy with the curved screenand I love it Only thing I miss is Air View from Samsung Galaxy S5 Super fast processing and the perfect size Large screen but still fits in my pocket Combined with the Gear VRawesome The fun never ends We now use my phone for hours of entertainment Love the VR goggles that came with the phone Once again Samsung has outdid themself Recently purchased the galaxy s7 and Im totally pleased Well more then pleased The style of this beauty turns heads Its slim design is comfortable both to hold and useas well as carying it along were ever you go It functions great Response time is phenomenal Over all I have no complaints The low lighting feature is really impressive the Expandable memory is a great feature Now that I have the new galaxy s7 I can video call my wife and not miss a thing Working a lot makes it hard to be home and now I can stay connected to the whole family Like it always use a Samsung Cool features sounds great music is better than others video games are both very good too I upgraded from an LG2 to this phone a week ago and so far I love it I have noticed the battery does not last as long as I would have expected and it seems I am continually recharging it Otherwise I am extremely happy with it Samsung has always been my favorite of all the phones on the market and will probably stick with them I have always used an iPhone and felt the need to switch as iPhone hasnt been as good as it used to be so decided to try out the galaxy S7 edge and live it the only regret I have is that I didnt switch sooner The phone is bigger than what Im used to but Im sure Ill be used to it in no time and as far as everything else goes the phone is amazing This phone replaced a Droid Maxx that I was generally happy with The only issue I had with that phone was the limited memory so when the S7 came out and I saw that it supported a 128gb MicroSD card I was all in And for the most part Im pretty happy with the phone except and this is a huge except battery life isnt great 

My Droid Maxx battery would last a day and a half sometimes two even with Bluetooth and WiFi turned on ALL the time This phone needs to be charged twice a day on average under the very same circumstances Even with Bluetooth and WiFi turned off I still cant get an entire days use without a recharge 

I understand that with computing power comes higher energy use and this phone certainly seems faster in every way For that I am stoked I just wish I could eek out a little more battery life 

One other thing the phone is very very nice looking and it feels good in your hand but you will soon enough find that it is actually too slick and go looking for a case with better traction This phone has everything I love the compact size I love the messaging app that comes with this phone on the Verizon network it displays any photos tweeted to you so you dont have to try to connect to the internet to see it I love the larger storage size and the extra slot for a micro sd card I do have a lot of music The camera is better the phone displays sharper images than before Even if I am looking at a picture in an ebook when I zoom in the picture display crisp and clear The messaging on this phone doesnt display in a new window it displays with an X at the top so you can close the pop up and go back to what you were doing or open in a browser The sound is better I suffer from hearing loss this phone actually helps me hear phone calls better with its sharp clear sound I really like Samsung Galaxy edge7 This product has so many interesting functions and design is great 
I like a camera and wide screen as well I highly recommend to everyone to have this beautiful phone The size is perfect 1 The Galaxy S7 Edge fits in your hand perfectly The fact that you can add space again is great The design is one of the best its easier to use and faster The battery life is longer which works better and lasts longer with the Gear S2 watch The overall make of the phone out does any other phone that I have purchasedone by far It is fast has an amazing camera and its the best As a senior user over 70 am satisfied with product Meets my needs and lets me use or decline as desired Sufficient using minimum plan Faster better camera standard 32gb storage quick charge battery many good features but nothing new for s5 or s6 users upgrading waiting for the next disruptive device maybe s8 Went from a S5 to S7 The camera is my favorite quality Wireless charging built in and expandable memory a plus I recently upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S3 to this phone and I have already talked some of my friends into changing to the S7 Lots of features Comes with Marshmallow loaded but Google is already working on Android N Carrier updates to newer Android versions really slow if at all Phenomenal camera Went from S4 to S7 so obviously performance greatly improved I love my Samsung 7 This is probably my 3rd Samsung Wouldnt have any other Just keeps getting better and better Great waterproof phone Clear with an amazing camera Great feature Some features do need to be downloaded  Only complaint its smaller then other phones out there Great phone over all This has been the easiest to use phone I have had yet Overall a great phone The only problem Ive had is the display blacked out on me and I had to do a hard restart to get my display back The only thing bad is the speaker phoneI sent 1 back and the new one is the same Sounds like you are underwater This phone enable a me to do whatever I need to wherever I am its good for gaming and for work This phone has exceeded my expectations I work from home a lot and in the field this phone has all the features I need to perform my tasks it is like having a miniature computer at my finger tips I really am starting to enjoy my Samsung more now that I am getting the hang of it At first it was a little overwhelming especially after switchimg from an iPhone But I really do like all the features and especially like the high quality camera I love my samsung galaxy s7 it has a beautiful touch and feel works smoothly and quickly my only complaint is that my phone connection when making calls seems a bit shoddy but as this is not what i primarily use the phone for it is not really an inconvenience to me This phone is amazing the best they ever made its slimmer smoot cute classy slick the extra storage is love we want more we want more n they gave us more thank you and the water proof is amazing my friend to a picture under water WOWWWW thank you so much The new Galaxy S7 edge is hands down no competition the best cell phone Ive ever owned It does everything And the edges of the phone are very much one of my favorite things about my S7 edge The only way to truly know what makes me so happy and excited about my S7 edge Is to get your own I give it 5 stars Thank you Samsung For making my life a whole lot easier I purchased my Samsung S7 edge and was happy with how easily I could transfer from my old phone a Note 4 I am love with it Ive have always been a Samsung user I love the features on the edges7 Takes great pictures I am very happy with the S7 The only issue I have is that Google Play Music used to show up on the lock screen so I could pause or skip without having to unlock the phone and I cant get the S7 to do that 

Thats my biggest complaint which means that the phone is excellent Get all the memory you can The edge is silly  it might be a really cool feature at some point but I didnt think it was beneficial in any way really Get an Otterbox Protect the phone I ran over my last phone with my car and the Otterbox was mangled but the phone had no damage at all 

So to sum up  The S7 is awesome sauce  get maximum memory and an Otterbox and help me ask them to update the phone to allow Google Play Music onto the lock screen For this to be a brand new phone the battery life stinks I even bought the portable charger and Im not happy with it either I hate that Im paying all this money for a phone that the battery drains faster when Im not using it than when I am using it just very disappointed in this phone and all I buy is Samsung they need to find a way to better the products I upgraded from a S5 and there is all the difference in the world Faster more features and very intuitive Excellent speaker quality I have only had this phone a short while however I love it already Easy to use camera is great and screen is beautiful even in the sunlight Easy to use Apps transferred easily Would be nice to have better battery life Quick charge is great This phone is the greatest out it tops all others The camera clarity and the functions are awesome Extremely fast phone Great all around features Only issue is that the phone is very slippery Hard to navigate without slipping Remedied with a case of course It was easy to transfer between my Nook Ereader and the S7 This phone did not disappointed Literally the only draw back that I could find was that I cannot yet find a 2piece impact resistant case that is clear so that I can still enjoy the beautiful styling of the chrome finish I love the new Samsung galaxy 7s Its faster and reliable This phone performs better than my Note 4 I was nervous about going to a phone where I could not swap my battery half way through a work day but this S7 has great battery life and the wireless charging is a great feature size is perfect and finish is good quality love the metallic look Pros crisp clear screen outstanding camera fast processor
Cons doesnt automatically alphabetize new apps moved the recent appsclose all from the home button to where the menu icon was

Overall Im very pleased that I upgraded to the s7 Im not normally an early adopter I usually use my phones until they almost stop working 
I updated for 2 reasons 
1 I needed more storage than the 16gb on my s4
2 I wanted my husband and to have the same phone so I wouldnt have to do the mental how do I do that back and forth between mine and his

Moving to the s7 solved both these problems We both like the wireless charging Its super fast and prevents the wallneck yanking that goes on when you forget your phone is plugged in and you pick it up  The display is incredibly clear Its very thin and lightweight

The things that drive me nuts On the s3  4 a long press on the home button displayed the recent apps and you could close them Thats moved to the left where the menu icon was A long press on the home button brings up google Im still getting used to it The inability of a new app to automatically alphabetize itself to its proper place on the apps screen is just plain silly Why did they do this From the message boards this appears to have been lost since the s6 Ive liked this phone a lot since I got it Ive had no problems and its really nice GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS VERSIONS 
GOOD SIZE NOT TOO BIG NOT TOO SMALL This phone is pretty easy and simple to use It loads apps quickly and the screen makes everything look so much better Every since i had my first samsung galaxy s5 i had yo get them all and try I had the s5 s6 and now s7 and i just love theses awesome phones samsung does an amannzing job keep up the great work Love that they brought the sd card back and love the slim but long design but my phone has already frozen when coming out of sleep mode to the point of needing to be rebooted and gets way too hot frequently My son got one too and his has also frozen and just randomly shut off We are not happy right now only flaw I can see on the normal s7 is that the screen curves toward the edges and this makes it hard to do some of the function on the edges of the screen I really like this phone and believe this is the best phone in the market right now The only challenge is that it cannot be used without a case as it is too slippery same applies to iPhone 
The best part of the phone is the camera that is fast and produces high quality pictures Samsung has always been my favorite line of electronics l Ive had many different types of phones but I always end back up with Samsung cus nothing Ive used could compare to this brand I love my s7 I love the features and the design of this phone Camera is great Battery life is good I have a lot of apps running The curve design is great and also that its water resistant already tested it I love this phone great features I can do way more on this phone then I could on my old iPhone But battery life is less then expected Im a bit disappointed Love the curve lines of the phone The edge menu is amazing I use it much more than I thought I would It is very user friendly and allows you to do what you need without having to open the phone The fingerprint reader is easier to use great phone im loving itI recommend this phone to all my friends and family I love that I can connect to my other Samsung devices My husband and I can easily keep track of our busy schedule I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 phone and have been enjoying it Great phone and easy to use Will be telling my friends about the phone I just recently upgraded my phone from the Galaxy S4 to the Galaxy S7 edge This product is amazing The new features are endless and the battery life is phenomenal My job requires me to be on my phone for the better half of each day and the fact that the battery is almost never below 50 by the time my work day is over I couldnt be more impressed Customizing this phone is also great I love how I can change the themes of this phone and basically personalize it so it has my own touch to it Well done Samsung They have made the Galaxy 7 a nice design without making to many drastic changes from the 5 I really like the changes made to the kids mode appwidget which my daughter loves Good features and great picture Plenty of storage space with SD cards the battery lasts longer and charges so much quicker the camera is amazing and everything is easy to find as well as use I love how slim it is I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it started to act up so I took it in for service then I found out that I was only 1 pymt away from paying it off and was able to get a new phone My son actually put the bug in my ear about it and a coworker just got one and she was showing me her new phone I was sold So we got 2 Samsung Galaxy 7 and the Edge for my son its super skinny so its hard to txt and hold on to itim gonna have to get a case or something but pretty much its just like my s4  it does take great pics though Best phone Ive ever had I never have to pull out my credit card any more because of Samsung pay Camara takes really great photos just all around great Ive been using Samsung smart phones since the first galaxy The S7 Edge feels like they got everything right It handles everything i throw at it with ease I can get through my day without having to stop and charge it This is the first phone i can just about say i have no issues with The finest smartphone Ive ever owned It has everything I absolutely love this phone I use it for everything and it has great battery life This phone is amazing I love it great quality pictures And it being waterproof makes it more awesome oh and paired with the Gear VR OMG Makes it even more Awesome I was pleasantly surprised when I was playing a game and a text came in at the top of the screen I saw that I could respond view or close I thought that was really cool Another feature that I found was that I could access my stickers Now I may be a little slow but I could never access them in previous versions of this phone I havent used the other split screen yet I also just discovered the edge for news and stuff I have yet to play with other features but in time Im sure I will fall even more in love with it The only downside is that the edges are touchy and the way I hold it I have a tendency to make other things happen And not necessarily good things Lol
The battery life is about the same as previous versions Much better then the 6s I am glad I did the upgrade Work great for me when take pictures and videos I love thanks Samsung This phone is so nice doesnt get any better than this Great except WIFI and Mobile Antennas are buggy If my WIFI is on I do not receive push notifications There is a serious issue with reception as well Best thing so far about this phone the camera Takes awesome pictures Totally in love with it Graphics are amazing I love the curved edge because when it is face down you can see who texted you by their contact color flashing on the side It seems to be somewhat fragile but other that that its an awesome phone Great phone with easily accessible features Sleek design for easy access and carry
Only issue I have is that is does not refresh email boxes as expected 
Camera is awesome I love the way the phone functions The features are great my favorite is the wireless charging I am a chauffeur and we have brand new Suburbans With the wireless charging I never have to worry about my phone going dead it is such a great feature Theres nothing worse than not having a cord to charge you phone and then remembering that I can do it with the car I also love the display on this phone as well as it being lightweight This is the third Galaxy phone I have owned and will continue to own them Dont understand why anybody would waste their money on an iPhone Super fast great for gaming and all around quick and easy to use and get used to The new camera is out if this world and Internet works incredible Great overall experience Love it 1st phone Im satisfied with Im very impressed with this phone The look and feel of the phone is amazingl The phone is very fast and smooth when operating The battery life is very good and it charges super fast All in all a quality device The edge design is flawless on this phone It is a responsive product and I have yet to kill my battery to below 15 I love my new phone it is light and easy to use The only issue I have is Im not used to having the edge so I tend to select things I dont mean to select Best Galaxy yet I am so glad that the SD card support was added back to this generation The battery life is impressive and love the new Operating System The water resistance is a huge plus as well Everything works effortlessly I had old Versions of the Galaxy Note and a windows Lumina 950xl which I wanted to throw daily because it would do what I wanted it too Zero issues with the Galaxy S7 Edge Brilliantly put together software and features to make everything quick and easyou for the user to do Absolutely love this phone Had an S5 for 2 years and it served me well until the last 2 months So I upgraded to S7 Love it Samsungso are easy to use Features are great Bought a big memoryx card so I can really work on my phone Im content with battery life and fast charging Would definitely buy this one again The only thing I would ding is the speaker It doesnt seem to be as loud as the last one But thats not a deal breaker for me I like it so far but the price is to much I believe I do believe it might be worth what they are wanting well we will see in time Im happy for the size and the screen clarity so far though I am very pleased with my new samsung s7 edge it performs great and i realy like the layout it is straight forward simple to use and quick at the readyi would recommend this to everyone  Its a good modern phone with a great display and many cool features and really good camera Its water resistant so its one less thing to worry about and you can add memory to the phone I havent had an upgrade in about 4 years but my old phone finally stopped working so I thought Id treat myself to the nice shiny and new Galaxy and a treat it was I LOVE THIS PHONE It met my expectations and yet even farther than that I highly recommend it if its in the budget I was always antiedge I always got the regular galaxy For some reason this one caught my eye and I absolutely love it The camera the screen easy to connect to my other devices are just a few pros I will never leave the Samsung Family I have owned a galaxy since the s3 until now Size is great and the apps are good but it dont get as good of service as the iPhone and when I listen to my music from the iTunes music app its nothing but static and I think it should be clear for the cost of the phone there should be no issues at all after this phone is payed for i will definitely go back to the iPhone for sure The battery life on the S7 is great Far better than the S6 Ive owned Samsung phones for years now and this literally is the best phone hands down Its sleek the screen is phenomenal and the processor is lightening fast I would definitely recommend this product to the world Best phone i ever had I would recommend to any one looking for the next big thing This phone is my office away from the office Dependable excellent photos and good battery life First time having a Samsung phone and I dont think I will ever go back to anything else This phone is great so far Ill be upfront I didnt get the Galaxy S6 because of the lack of expandable storage When I heard that the S7 was going back to that I was ecstatic It was coming time for me to get a new phone and I immediately went for the Galaxy S7 and I have absolutely no regrets Its a solid phone with a great set of functions like the fingerprint scanner the enhanced camera and so much more The fact that its water resistant like the S5 was icing on the cake 

All in all I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a solid smartphone Had a LG curve before the samsung s7 cant beat the s7 tho the screen is a lot smaller its much clearer and the sound is a lot cleaner and has a builtin equalizer its also waterproof This is a great phone Samsung took all the best features from the S5 most notably the return of the expandable memory slot and merged them with the improvements of the S6 to make a great phone wrapped into the perfect size device I didnt want to upgrade from the S5 to the S6 because some of the best features were gone S7 has everything I need and is super fast I have a Samsung S7 I have a Samsung tablet and I have a Samsung headphone Bluetooth Samsung its a good product I wish that everything was Samsung great performance on the tablet the phone but the Bluetooth had problems out of it breaks up your phone call had to send it back waiting on it now but I would like to thank Samsung customerservice they are good at resolving any problem you have a Samsung I really love that about Samsung deal with them online or call customerservice you have a account with Samsung AR a great company to deal with the best sound out with in a long time when buying stuff online thats all I have for right now Im waiting on my Samsung TV to come to me I already have two 50 inch Samsung TV Im waiting on another 148inch Samsung Smart TV now my name is Davie oh yes on the Samsung S7 I like it because it has magnifying glass where I can blow up the screen and my words because I am partially blind easy to go from the s5 to the s7 felt very comfortable in the hand on complaint is the battery life tends to go faster the my old phone Searching on the internet is faster The battery lasts much longer I can pick up in places that were dead zones in the past Overall I love this phone Met ALL my expectations and more Love everything about Samsung Galaxy except for the screen being able to be broken so easily I was having Iphone all along and wanted to try Samsung phone Love the features of this phone I had note 3 for awhile now and i thought the screen will be too small When i first upgraded i got the 6 edge plus but then decided to change it to the s7 The size was not bad The size of the screen didnt bother me at all It wasnt to big or too small When i learned that s7 has expandable storage i was so happy I enjoy taking pictures I really like the quality Its like having having my dslr camera but in smaller version  Im glad i upgraded to this phone I have yet to find any problems with the phone  have had problems with car stereo Kenwood in wifes car and Bluetooth with edge series phones but it appears to be Kenwood not the phone because it works fine with my pumpkin android stereo in truck batter so far has easily lasted a day and thats with full brightness of screen This is the first phone Ive been excited about in years Excellent edge features It does not disappoint My first was the Samsung S4 I absolutely loved that phone
Then my wife made me switch companies and got an IPHONE 6s well I am back to Samsung and so amazed what this phone can do
I sell real estate and I am always on my phone from calls text to the web to find properties the speed the capabilities and camera functions Amazing Samsung has done it again not only is this easy to use however features are user friendly and dont require a lot of effort in use I cannot afford the time to research features and uses and the competition doesnt hold up and falls too far from the tree not with the S7 no pun intended Ever thought about going into the truck making business I am truly happy with my Samsung Galaxy S7its so easy to operate and meets my every expectation
 I have owned a Samsung phone since cell phones were part of my everyday life It makes it easy even for me to keep in touch with the family The picture quality is awesome
I would recommend a Samsung Galaxy S7 to anyone who asks
I am a true supporter
Keep up the good work Samsung
Sincerely a true supporter
Christine B I previously owned a Galaxy S4 and upgraded to the S7 for the enhanced camera features I am thrilled with the photos this camera takes in low light I take a lot of pictures In addition The S7 phone is so easy to learn Even for a senior citizen like me I didnt even have to consult the instructions to set the features to my style and liking I am hooked on Samsung and my girlfriend is switching from the IPhone to the Galaxy S7 because of the pictures this camera takes I tell everyone that this is the best phone to buy on the market Hands down a winner  Thanks Samsung for your pursuit of perfection Not sure how you could improve on anything I am so happy with the S7I upgraded for the camera but got tons of extra features that blows the competition away Awesome fast Feels smooth in your hand Bright display Awesome low light photos The ease of learning is better than I imagined being in my 60s This phone is amazing It is both beautiful and effective The ads about the battery life and fast charge rate are no joke I can fully charge the phone from 10 in just an hour And that charge lasts half a day easily with a heavy load My S4 would last almost 3 days on a full charge but it was rooted and had custom firmware With Marshmellow and this hardware combo I dont think I will have to

The only problem is that the screen is so rich that I dont want to watch videos on my TV now and the phone itself is to beautiful to trap in a case

Oh and thank you Samsung for bringing back the SD card Cloud storage is great and had its uses but an SD should always be standard Nice phone Samsung keeps getting better and better Ive always loved Samsung over any other products and it still holds true Sleek stylish sexy The phone feels and looks expensive Its a great upgrade from my previous phone the S4 Poor performance when using any feature with the microphone or speakers Im very disappointed I had a much less expensive Samsung prior to the S7 and it out performed this phone hands down It doesnt hear well hears wrong or doesnt hear at all the speaker is poor quality if you use your speakers for hands free talking forget The person your talking to will definitely complain you will be hard to hear and those you talk to using your speaker will repeatedly tell you you are breaking up  cant hear you take me off speaker I love the Samsung S7 The Internet is great and it doesnt freeze up The games are fun to play The camera takes beautiful and clear pictures The sound is great also I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone that can do it all The Galaxy S7 edge has so much more screen display and the graphic colors are beautiful This phone is amazing Love the camera size of the phone and the fact that its waterproof The new S7 Edges camera is terrific in low light conditions While not having quite as much definition as others it more than makes up for it in sensitivity The screen is great and is a true HD screen Using screen mirroring with an HD TV was a revelation the wireless output was great with no lag time

The only real downside is the fact that the back of the phone appears to be glass This causes the phone to be quite slippery and an aftermarket back cover is a necessity to prevent dropping The Edge feature is nice but the trade off is that there is no protection for the screen My wife and I both purchased the S7 Edge after owning the last 2 generations of iPhones and various iterations of LG and Motorola Android phones before that The S7 Edge has exceeded our expectations in every way The phones styling is stunning and unique and the Gold Platinum color is much more subdued in person than advertising shots indicate The user interface is intuitive and easy to learn even for someone who has been IOS exclusive for many years I could go on for paragraphs about the speed and performance of the S7 Edge but its Samsungs flagship so that should be expected You will be impressed with the performance of phone Ive loaded quite a few apps and it hasnt slowed down a bit The screen is fantastic and the edge seemed a bit gimmicky at first but it really does a bunch of cool stuff that you will use a lot once you customize it I am thoroughly impressed with the camera and imaging software Call quality on both handset and speaker is excellent but the speaker lacks a bit when playing music Samsung includes a lot of handy software thats worth checking out I havent a single complaint about this phone and am extremely happy with my purchase Be aware that the edge screen prevents the use of a traditional heavy duty case so if you need your phone covered completely on all 6 sides you should consider the S7 instead The S7 Edge is limited to stick on screen protection only at the moment due to its design Hands down the best phone I have ever owned Allows me to customize to my taste while still giving me all of the features Ive come to love in Samsung I love it Great phone Very durable Incredibly fast response Great phone great features I like the external memory the water resistant is an A virtual reality is awesome i will love if you make a small version of it the galaxy s6 edge is a perfect size if you make the s6 edge version size of this phone i will get it thanks This is my 1st smart phone so I cant compare the Edge to my old phone 1st off I thought my old phone was the greatest phone evah Now that I am learning how the Edge works  RTFM I now think the Edge is the greatest phone Evah It is a little difficult to get used to holding a touch screen phone because Im always touching something I shouldnt be touching right now But Im learning The phone is pretty intuitive  the directions are very easy to decipher I thought Samsung would have a Lil Wayne What contest where I could win some Lil Wayne tats a case of Krystal  a fish tank but I havent found that yet but the free VR ware  game pack look pretty interesting Anyway back to the phone its water resistant  pretty tough I dropped it onto my counter  it survived It also charges super quickly  the wireless charger is great I think Samsung has created a great phone here  deserve alot of credit for that Thanks Samsung I will reccomend you  your S7 Edge phone to all of my friend Now stop hanging out with Wesley  go buy your Edge Great design Fast response on the touch screen Im still trying to understand why camera filters doesnt always get set automatically Love the way the phone saves the battery Love this phone Works smoothly and cant stop playing with all of the different apps The best phone I have ever owned got my wife one Thinking I will stay with Samsung for now on I like the features of this phone My last two phones were iphones Absolutely in love with my gs7 From the resistance to the software its amazing I love the water proof on the s7 edge Ive tried it and its awesome So disappointed there is no signature line available on texting It is needed I have never preordered a phone before but I was overdue for an upgrade from the S3 so I thought why not Its a great phone does way more than I really need but it makes everything convenient and improves on a lot of what I loved about the S3 upgraded from Samsung S5 best phone ever easy to use I dont see much difference between the s5 and this s7 but overall its been just as good so far Great features  great camera and great edge features The galaxy s7 edge is my favorite phone yet The features the speed of the phone the sleek design and great screen all contribute to Samsung best phone yet I been using Samsung phones ever since the galaxy s2 The GS7 edge provides the best in hardware and desgin The battery life on this device is amazing I can easily go through a whole day with no problems Another great feature is IP68 I like knowing that if I accidentally drop my phone on water Ill still survive Overall its

with some of the things from the s6 but very very happy with this new model We had a S4 prior to the S7 The S7 is better phone Fast processor good battery life great camera 
Using the phone was easy in that it is very similar to the S4


Love it S7 has everything I loved about the S5 with so much more They have made so many intuitive changes to the OS Bringing back the memory expansion was a must The free Gear VR is awsome So happy i decided to upgrade Do yourself a favor and upgrade if you can Love all the new features but how the old ones are still there to make the transition seamless Upgrading from galaxy S4 to the S7 edge and feel right at home with a new phone with better performance and design Best phone features and options The camera is excellent I cant believe the short time it takes to charge That is the best feature so far This phone has a brilliant display takes awesome pictures and takes the pictures with no delay Unpopular because after it came out I still dont see in store new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S7Edge Still I see cases for the S6 I also like the wireless charger and I see the phone is like an iPhone with the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone The video is amazing they brought SD card back its slimer waterproof and slightl6 fast its a great phone This product is water resistant and that helps me a lot I jumped ship I heard about everything the new S7 had to offer and thought that was the phone for me Its so easy to use I loved that it came with a little adapter to be able to transfer my info to the S7 Being able to insert a micro sd card is a major plus I love the size of the phone as well For me its the perfect size I also love that I no longer have to use iTunes to put music on my phone This is the best move I have made with a new phone in such a long time and I would highly recommend others to bail and go for the new Samsung S7 ASAP This phone is spectacular I love everything about it the curved edges just make the screen view amazing and adds an extra sharpness to the overall view of the phone The phones camera takes splendid pictures and the extra effects make it fun to use Also I cant wait to test it out this summer when I can use the camera under water How awesome is that Also transferring information from my galaxy s6 active was incredibly easy I used the new connector that was included with the phone and it was easy as 123 My wife also purchased this phone after seeing it and switched from her iPhone 6 to the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge Its so convenient to call her now and use the video chat feature I absolutely love this phone and will recommend it to all my friends and the general public I cant wait for the next Samsung Galaxy to come out and see what new amazing features it has to offer I made the leap from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Its a beautiful phone and I am loving it Ive had it for about two months and its everything its cracked up to be But I still wont test its waterproofness if there is such a word on purpose I am clumsy enough to do it some time in the future and Ill let you know how it goes then Super fine just took my S4 files to my new S7
Much more A new learning cure ahead Love it I purchased this phone from Bestbuy The activation process was extremely easy Transferring Apps pictures and contacts from the old phone was easy using the supplied microusb device Everything works flawlessly I particularly like the wireless charging additional memory slot and always on scrren with time I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MY NEW S7 PHONE BECAUSE I STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH IT FROM THE BEGINING SPOKE TO THE RETAILER BEFORE MY 14 DAYS WAS UP EXPECTING A REPLACEMENT AND INSTEAD AL I GOT WAS A BUNCH OF NON SENSE I AM A LOYAL SAMSUNG CUSTOMER AND EXPECTED BETTER I SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT MY S5 IT WORKED MUCH BETTER EVEN THOUGH IT HAD LESS UPGRADES SINCE VERIZON WOULD NOT REPLACE MY 2 AN A HALF WEEK OLD PHONE I HOPE SAMSUNG WILL AFTER THEY READ THIS REVIEW ALL I WANT IS WHAT I PAID FOR A WELL WORKING S7 THANK YOU already tested and works flawlessly underwater and wireless fast charge amazing Battery life is great its lightening fast and 32G storage Camera is in excellent quality Screen very sharp and clear along with a lasting battery Wireless charging another convenience It summary a great phone I decided to change my stillworking Samsung Galaxy S4 for the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Although my S4 worked fine I can definitively see the difference and improvements in the new S7 The camera is what I like the most I am still trying to figure out some of the features but until now just in love with new phone Allways had Iphones changed to samsang galaxy s7 it has the best apps Like the android operating system better than apples os Great phone with the best features back water resistant and SD card I like the new phone  the battery lasts longer  I also like the fact that I can close the apps that are running in the background  The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a beautifully crafted piece of history The sleek curvy design fits the hand very well The camera is beyond comparison in the cell phone world 4K  2K possibilites make it a step above consumer level DSLR cameras The processing speed is in a class of its own I have used the Note 3 Note 5 and the most of the S series models and the S7 Edge is truly the best phone to date Do NOT stop in your pursuit to make me the Samsung End User happy You are doing a great job I recently purchased the Samsung S7 Edge and have been extremely impressed with all the new features and design of the phone I own a technology company and I live on my phone on a daily basis and the Samsung S7 has made that daily grind actually easier for me on a daily basis The ability to actually perform work duties in addition to utilizing the S7 as a phone has change my daily routine and saved me time and money

Thanks Samsung for this great product Fantastic product highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade So far and it will be 3 weeks in 2 days Im quite satisfied with my new S7 I like the camera a lot I like that its very fast and I like the fact that it is possible to remove addons I never use
On a slightly negative side I find the touch screen is either too responsive or not responsive enough Im a poke with 1 finger texter old  have bad thumbs and certain letters especially the p for some reason I have to usually poke a couple of times
Another problem is my daughter  I talk daily on her way home from workall of a sudden I cant hear her or she cant hear me My bluetooth connects the suddenly disconnects She and others have told me they cant hear me when Im using speakerphone
Non of this was true 1 month ago when we both had S5s I recently uprated from the Note3 and Im very pleased with my new Galaxy S7 The screen is provides really really sharp and clean images Or didnt take to much to get used too the slight differences in functionality The only thing I miss is my Spen Choi jotting quick notes And i had to adjust to a slightly smaller screen size however that slightly smaller size mskes it easier to carry I love this phone navigating is so easy and everyday Im learning something new Overall performance is great plenty of storage and RAM Does not bog down with apps and games 

My only complaint with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is very little space for fingers to hold phone while using it without touching the screen The phone itself is great the battery life is great 
I dont like the operating system I switched from a 
Galaxy s5 I really liked that set up plus the s5 had the 
Ability to use the peel smart remote for my TVs 
And other appliances This phone does not have that ability and this operating system and keyboard set up 
Is more like a iPhone I am not a fan of the iPhone thats why I purchase only Galaxy smart phones
I hope that there is a software update to fix the little glitches soon since the phone keeps freezing and restarting Please fix these issues The Galaxy s7 has definitely stepped it up a few notches Pioneering into a new breed of smart of smart phones The curved edge on the back Then the 2160 video camera on the back but it only shoots for 10 minutes The fingerprint sensor is great and the keyboard I am loving my new Galaxy S7 Its easy to use no complaints on this side This has been so easy to set up and adjust to compared to other android phones Very little hassle Was easy to transfer content and love the new interface introduced with Marshmallow Samsung manages to make it a much more user friendly interface from what I can tell so far Time will tell what I think later down the road though but I am optimistic that I will be satisfied with this phone Nice phone just pricey I like the option to upgrade the memory The color is really crisp The size of the phone is just the right size The pictures are great I like that they have simplified the menus now things are eaSierra to find As the the camera its  mad sick the speed improvement and the selfish mode is just awesome Every detail of the phone is exactly what I expected My S5 was still working great but I couldnt resist the temptation for the S7 Edge after reading all of the positive reviews It was a good decision Happy with every aspect of this phone Fast pretty and good battery life This phone is great The speed of processing and the graphics are much better than my previous phone The speakers are some of the best Ive experienced in a mobile phone and the size is perfect Bought March 31 2016  Overall very good phone Upgraded from S5 which I had to charge twice a day and was very very slow So far Ive been able to go all day off of one charge lots of emailgeneral browsingtexting occasional calling Fast Display is vibrant No issues with overheating Lowlight camera is a huge improvement These arent galleryquality photos mind you but still a huge leap forward and more than enough for casual look at my dog sleeping in my lap facebook photos The selfie features wave to set a timer or put your finger on the HR monitor to snap are genius and make the already awkward process of photographing yourself slightly easier The fingerprint sensor lock is a nice feature when you can position your finger right Call quality is good No issues with bluetooth or wifi connectivity

My only concern is with the phone itself  the body is glass and even with a case on it I fear for its safety I am very hard on my phones Its also a fingerprint magnet and its a shame to have to cover up something that looks so sharp This is a wonderful feeling phone and feel sturdy the screen reaction touch interface is handsdown one of the best as far as the features go its a typical Samsung device no surprises great phone very happy with it You wake up get bored or cant fall asleep you turn to your phone Do you grab it just to text or to play a game Well whatever you like this phone has it all It is so beautiful to even look at the speed and power this device is capable of makes it possible to handle any task or hobby you could want personal or professional without having to boot up a computer or tablet Some will say it may be too big except hey they cover that too with advanced features that will allow one hand operation Point is buy it love it have no regrets Overall I rate this phone as my favorite phone since my old candy bar  flip open keyboard phone 
The speed of the processorram has never once left me waiting for my phone to catch up to my use and abuse of it
The Camera is lightyears ahead of my Note 4 and way faster in all respects than the Note 4 and S5 I shot video of high speed aircraft and when paused  a plane at 130mph passing in front of me was 100 clear zero blur

Audio quality is great on phone calls playback audio is louder than I expected

Battery life is giving me a solid 12 hours without need for charge no matter what I do  screen on and playing games all morning I can make it to dinner without any issue
The SD Card slot is a game changer from the S6  especially those of us who take a lot of photos

Personally I am not a fan of the glass back  showed every fingerprint and was difficult to hold onto in my daily life  but I put an otterbox symmetry on it and that is now a nonfactor

Samsung pay is amazing  works every place Ive tried that uses a swipe for a card  not the push inpull out style the reader is too far back Ive made many friends with iphones jealous

Hands down the best Samsung to date

I wish I could replace the battery but only because Im hard on my phones
Well see how this new intelligent chargingwireless charging does over the next couple years of use

The always on clock on the screen is very handy and I love that I can fingerprint unlock OR pattern unlock might be a marshmallow update
1010 easily I have never been so impressed with a phone before Ive recommended this phone to tons of people and I will continue to do so The phone has some nice features but it feels like it could have benefited from a preinstalled music player and other features that I have had preinstalled on other phones Not very impressed It froze a few times already Can beraly press the 0 and 21 button I have had a galaxy phone since the galaxy 3 This is the best one that has been produced yet  Very fast operating system loads of memory and has the memory slot as well Congratulations Samsung

I have switched to all Samsung electronics as older item die Smart TV Smart phones tablet

Happy to be a Samsung customer I have never had to call for any type of support so I have no idea of customer support Great job once again I have used three other Galaxy phones and then I decided to try a different brand for my last phone It was good but it was not a Samsung Galaxy phone I came back to the Galaxy family for the seamless integration of software and hardware the consistent performance and the features Very easy transition from old S3 slight learning cure to adjust to faster speed and appwidgets love increased pictures aps work very together I bought this phone when it first came out its the best phone for the value It has everything you want in a phone and more its beautiful and classie The vr system is amazing I recently switched from the iPhone 6 to the S7 and it has exceeded my expectations Absolutely wonderful phone with great features Fast charging is amazing and very handy The phone has a wonderful battery life but if needed I can recharge my battery from virtually nothing to full battery in an hour Also the water proofing is amazing The first day I had the phone it fell in a cooler full of water and was fine 
The only problem Ive had is a select few apps such as Snapchat that require high output occasionally crash for seemingly no reason Im sure this will be fixed in no time with updates 
Overall Im beyond pleased with this phone and will continue to buy Samsung products for many years I love my new samsung s7 edge I like its slim design and the camera on it I also like that it is waterproof I absolutely love the features especially the camera However the phone tends to get really hot while Im using it Also its advertised that the battery can last all day with heavy use but simply having my GPS and the shealth step counter on my battery has to be charged halfway through the day I cant use the smart unlock because I have to keep my GPS turned off in order to make my battery last all day Please do us a favor and get a battery that can support all the features you offer Best phone I have ever had
The display looks incredible and has the features to to not only take advantage of it but also the power to be future proof I recently switched over to Samsung and was a little apprehensive in making the change I had gotten used to my old phone and all the ways that I was able to integrate it into my everyday life 

I was shocked to find that the Galaxy S7 is extremely easy to use even for someone who had very little experience with Samsung devices and packed with a ton of great features 

The camera speaks for itself and I have been using it to record video of my sons hockey games The quality is amazing and holds even as I use smart view to watch on my Samsung TV 

One area that I thought would be a drop off from my old phone was how seamless everything works together I am extremely pleased that the S7 is even more seamless integrating my calendar emails photos maps and work documents effortlessly 

I always thought I would never leave my old brand but now there is a good chance that I may never go back This is my 4th galaxy Great product and easy to use Great camera and I love the battery life The screen is perfect My Samsung 7 phone is the best mobile phone I have ever owned It is so much more user friendly that the earlier mobile models I love how it easily it syncs with my laptop which is Windows based My prior phone gave me nothing but trouble Whenever or wherever I add a new contact for example it shows up in both places with no hassel Some of the features I particularly enjoy are the Do Not Disturb the fingerprint login the Samsung Pay app which I use almost everywhere and the datetime display I can say without a doubt that the camera on my phone is excellent Ive taken several photos and all have turned out crisp and clear Lastly  but important to me  I like the gold finish of the case I even purchased a clear case for it so I could enjoy the look of the gold case Im so glad I waited for the Samsung phone and ordered it when it first became available Good work Samsung I love my new Galaxy S7 Very waterproof I had honey leak from my lunch all over it and I just rinsed it off in the sink with no worries I play music all day at work using wifi and bluetooth and the battery holds up well The camera is wicked awesome and I am still learning how much it can doamazing product Greatest phone I have ever used Upgraded from S6 Almost double the battery life so far and very smooth operation

But the screen wakes up seemingly at random several times a day which can be quite distracting I have been using Samsung phones for a while now I have had the S4 Note 3 the S5 and now the S7 I have got to say the S7 is the best one yet Im happy to see the Micro SD card come back and hope fully removable batteries hint hind Samsung It is a sleek and light phone with blazing speed and good battery life The fast charger does make up for not having removable batteries I briefly went to the Droid Turbo 2 and I have to say I was very disappointed and had to come back to samsung They provide a high quality phone and exceed my expectations every time This is my first smart phone and love everything from its feel to it beauty The crystal clear display is absolutely immaculate A great match for the superb camera Still experimenting with Apps and Battery life but feel this device is very simple to use and modify to be the tool you want it to be I really love this phone its perfect in so many ways Get your hands on one and youll understand I only wish it was a bit more affordable but flagship phone are always very expensive The Samsung S7 is a great phone This makes my third Samsung phone in a row upset that there is no IR I used my S5 for a remote on a few things I did not have remotes for Not sure why such a seemingly small inexpensive part would be left out This product is amazing its waterproof which is great for when you accidently spill liquid around your phone The camera quality is out of this world just pure genius I would recommend this product to anyone Love it This is a great samsung product I recommend it I absolutely love the Galaxy s7 edge It is very easy to use and there are SO many cool and extra things you can do on this phone compared to other phones Not only does it just look awesome but its got the best camera Ive ever seen I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone I LOVE it Very easy to use Fast Camera is quick to use when pressing the home button twice Multitasking is easy This phone was almost good enough to replace my Nvidia Shield if it was not for the games I play draining the battery so fast I love the new gaming feature and the excellent HD I wish the default storage size was larger than 32 GB I store movies on my phone to watch at work on break time and I like to have a lot of movies and media on my phone but I still love my phone I purchased this phone to replace a 10 year old flip phone and it has been a great experience The phone has great performance and features including the awesome camera The finger print reader and Samsung Pay features work great I turned off the Alwayson feature to extend the battery life since the clock is just a push of the home button away Maybe there will be a future software update that give a little more control over what is displayed on the Alwayson screen I recently purchased the Galaxy S7 I am really impressed with the new features I am still learning about the phone but am happy that I decided to upgrade from the S4 I purchased this phone to replace an 8 year old slider phone and the experience has been excellent There has been a slight learning curve to using a smart phone overall but this phone is easy to use and the camera is awesome We have been using the ATT DriveMode app to limit distractions while driving and it works great So far the battery has been lasting for several days if just using it to make calls or send a few texts and the wireless charger is a cool accessory Best phone on the market Ive had a total of 8 Samsung phonesthis one is best by far Very fast chargingbright crisp colors Great memory installs items super fast The color is so refreshing I love the new Galaxy S7 It has all the features that I need and more I love the fast processor and the new camera is fantastic Picture quality is amazing and I love the many different camera modes that are offered The Google account being used for almost everything makes it very easy because I dont have to remember many different passwords Overall a great phone Great fast phone with excellent video playback HD call experience is a bit weird but great clarity I really love the new camera it is much better than the 3 and the 5 I had I think the price is pretty steep and dont love how you cant buy them with a 2 year contract anymore Love the phone though The phone it self is similar to the s6 but taking away megapixels of the camera did not hurt hie amazing the picture looks That being said it use to draij my battery and now it can go all dat eith no issue Fits well in my hand Bright display Love this new phone The galaxy s7 is the best phone Ive ever had to date Have never held a better designed phonevery nice and smooth to holdwhat is better than water resistance and an SD CARD cant say enough about the battery fast charging is great the phone has lasted me 25 days before on a full charge The software and CAMERA is the best in the marketpictures look unreal and true to the eyenever been happier and it came with the free vr gear which sweetens the dealthe fingerprint is super accurate I have been a galaxy user for years I love the new S7 edge The camera takes amazing pictures and has more features than my Note Edge The size is perfect Battery lasts ALL day even with consistent use The camera is the best phone camera Ive used to date I have been a Samsung Galaxy user since the s5 and love this phone and all is feature Samsung just keep making a great product with better features thanks and keep up the good work I bought the S7 one week ago I am now on my 2nd one due to the phone randomly restarting 2nd phone with same issue Awful If you dont mind the phone restarting 15 to 20 times a day then this is a grand phone Fits nicely in my hand Easy to use 
Takes BEAUTIFUL pictures 
Overall no complaints I love this phone This is a greal phone really love the display I swapped from iPhone 6  and this is much better way to go Samsung I like the gold choice of color Its a little pricey I have had my phone about a month now and I really dont have any complaints I charge it at night and it pretty much lasts throughout my entire day unless I watch several movies I love the always on feature the themes selections and water resistance The only thing I havent been able to figure out if how to video call it always says its not available right now Besides that the S7 is an awesome phone I am 70 years old and must admit Im having a tough time adjusting to all the new technology with this new Galaxy 7 but I am determine to learn how to use it If I continue to have a difficult time learning Ill get my 12 year old granddaughter to teach me The design is basically the same a little thinner as far as Battery life Im not sure yet if its really better because its so new Had the s5 with the fast charging port and this is even faster even with the simple mini USB In addition to charging fast it also holds charge much better

Samsung has become much more appealing with some exclusive extras as well Got the free wireless charger deal with this phone Thought it was a cool bonus but kind of smoke and mirrors However I have found it to be quite handy It charges fast and not having to find the end of the chord in the dark 

The camera on this is noticeably better than the 55 as well on top of everything else this is a gorgeous phone This is my 1st smart phone It is hard to believe I went so long before I made the move Made my 1st purchase with smart pay today Everything works perfectly Excellent phone great camera very fast good job Samsung I love this phone I upgraded from the s5 because s6 didnt seem worth it to me When I heard about the camera on the s7 I had to have it The handling of this phone is just so comfortable The camera is perfect The SD card slot being back is great wonderful phone it is a marvelous phone and the best phone in the market aroun This is my second phone with Samsung and I love it I use it for personal and my business I would recommend it to anyone Only thing I wish was it was a little bigger but if you liked the previous Saturday series phones youll love this  The camera is awesome best Ive seen on a phone Although it may not have all the features of some phonesort it is super fast Took awesome pictures while on vacation Better than my wifes iphone 6s camera Its a Samsung Everything about it is fantastic I cant think of anything negative to saybecause its a great company I love my S 7 and Im not a young person but Im constantly on my phome Thank you for all your products Ive had the S3 and the Note 3 My S7 Edge is by far the BEST phone I have EVER had Had it for over 2 weeks and STILL learningunbelievable Great phone nice performance great VR content Definitely a must have I had an iPhone  at first I thought it was nice But it haseems so many problems  such as the camera started to fail The wireless Internet connection started to not pick up connections unless I was right next to the router So I told a friend of mine my problems She told me about the Samsung phones and how the camera never fails and how much storage they have Its a great phone and I will never change from it I even got the Samsung tablet Very happy Never getting a iPhone or iPad again No words other than I love my gold 7 Fast great camera picture quality is great size is perfect I have lots of samsung products and this one just shows they keep getting better The GS7 is a beautiful piece of hardware and runs as smooth as it looks Upgraded from the GS5 Active and all I really had to do was add a lifeproof case and this phone has me 100 percent satisfied Thank you Samsung for making exceptional products This is a far better product than the S4 it replaced although the features are similar they are different enough to take time getting used to I like that its waterproof and made to be used as a portable phone ie you dont have to treat it with kid gloves Im not saying you can toss it around like a football but its a tough little machine All in all I would recommend this to anyone looking for a really good phone that enables you to add memory to it unlike some other overpriced phones that give you no ability to add memory so your stuck with the factory memory card Two thumbs up to Samsung for making such user friendly solid dependable phones Bravo BTW my wife and I like these so much we bought two i wish they made a glass protector offer different cases my purchase was an upgrade from Note 4 and the fingerprint sensor for the galaxy 7 is the best yet The ease of touch screen and movement of apps is also a great change for me This is my 4th Galaxy and is without a doubt the best The phone is best in class and Samsung Pay works everywhere I highly recommend I carry an iPhone 6s Plus for work and wanted a personal phone The Galaxy S7 edge has amazing build quality and performance Great phone Although I only had the phone for a month i havent had any issues with the phone The camera is excellent and all the preinstalled apps are very helpful I still havent use the phone for to its full potential The video option is good but I would like for it to connect to all phone companies as long as it is a Samsung Love the camera features absolutely the best types of pictures I have taken on any phone love the thumb print lock nice screen glad they brought the memory card back the health features hr monitor stress monitor etc although improved the only downside is the battery mostly because I am coming from a phone with a great battery life I have been a loyal Samsung user for a few years now Before I only cared about camera capabilities But now that I have been able to enjoy both functionality and have a good camera Cant get any better Owner of a remodeing business i am very hard on phones I have replaced phones some times twice a month but then I got the galaxy active had it for 2years not a problem one 
Just got the S7 and it has all I need and then some
The camera in low light is amazing There is nothing better out there And the data transfer from my old galaxy went smoothly 
The only time ever that I was able to transfer all text documents email pictures and dont forget the over 430 contacts what was the most important 
And was able to do it in my front room right out of the box 
Time well tell if it holds up as good as the older model I had the s6 and it was a very good phone but my only complaint was the battery With the s7 they totally fixed that I have no trouble getting through the day with this plus everything else on it is improved from last year Overall this is a great phone Samsung really went the extra mile with this phone The S7 improves on the stunning look of the S6 by adding the SD card memory option back by making the battery larger and by adding water resistance The quick charging is great too The camera is really fast and takes some really nice pics Especially in low light I like to play games on my phone and the new Game Launcher features are sweet The S7 never has gotten hot no matter how long I play I am really impressed with this phone I was worried about TouchWiz but it is smooth and really great I loved my s5 but needed more internal storage and wireless charging The s7 is GREAT A must have Bringing back expandable memory exciting new features and continuing to stay true to the Galaxy line I really like my samsung galaxy s7 because its a really good phoneAnd its the best phone that i ever had And its better then all the enther phone i had in the past and now Love my phone is fast and has great camera love love the memory space This is the most beautiful display on a smart phoneSamsung keeps getting better and better just got a 55 inch curved Samsung 4k uhd TV with the picture looks amazin definitely recommend Samsung products to anyone who loves top quality technology Great product Good for all uses Quality is a screen is a great size Also speakers are niceloud and clear everything works quicker on this phonegreat deal I think Samsung has really stepped it up with the S7 Edge It is considerably more responsive and slick design is one to show off I am happy and would recommend it to anyone My wife had an IPhone 5c before I got her the Galaxy S7 and she loves it The pictures Ive taken on both these phones are truly amazing This is truly a great phone Easy to operate and navigate thru and set up I will recommend it to my family and friends for sure Is really good Im so happy with that I recommended definitely The s7 has a great design very sleek phone  I really like the camera on this particular phone I highly recommend it Couple things Im not happy with if Im having problems sending MMS text messages and in the settings I wish you was a little bit easier to find certain things but overall Im happy with the phone Hardware wise this beats just about every phone As a longtime nexus user the saamung ui is ok There is more bloatware then Im use to and it lacks a couple of small things like the caller ID on the stock android dialer I just love my Samsung 7 It has all the features that I need and is easy to use Best camera ever  SD card is back for movies  awesome battery what can I say except performance is greater than expected Finally a product that will help in converting iPhone users to android  Love this phone Its fast as lightening and some of the features like split screen or the one hand option are great One thing I have noticed is that my fingers get noticed by the edge of the screen so when Im typing with the opposite hand it doesnt register or it deletes what Ive already typedbut overall a great phone We all know that if you want a premium phone youre going to pay a high price With my last phone being the Galaxy s5 this is a complete upgrade Samsung did it right by bringing back the water resistance and expandable storage Samsung pay is amazing and fun to use itll take a couple of tries to figure it out The phone looks beautiful and performs well Finally the camera is gorgeous The only bad thing is Im not fond of the battery life Overall this phone is completely worth the buy I love my samsung galaxy s7 edge phone The color of everything shown on the phone is very vivid It has so many features but very easy to use It also has a lot of memory Im a photo bug so I take a lot of picture which come out awesome So glad I purchased it Wasnt so sure about buying this phone but it turned out to be such a great phone Love it very much This is an amazing phone I have had the s5s6 and note 3 The edge out shines them all I Love This Device Everything promised was given with this thing its so fast so fun and calls people too When I am using my phone sometimes the edge where you put your hand when typing prevents you from typing because it is already being touched When you hold it in landscape allow the edge to disappear This is by far the best phone I have seen on the market Fast easy to use right size Never going back to an iPhone Great phone Nice screen Beautiful Call clarity is the best Ive ever heard Would recommend to anyone So the only reason I bought the phone was the expandable memory feature Pre ordered the phone and luckily was able you claim the VR headset Another reason I purchased So I had the phone a week and did a system update Heres where the problem began After the update my phone got super hot and started acting funny The phone would turn on the home screen randomly and turn off the home screen randomly Did a reset and deleted my apps to see if it was corrupted Nope So I logged on to Samsung support and dealt with a man for hours trying every option imaginable to get my phone working After 8 hrs of resets and no luck he directed me to call a Verizon corporate store to have my phone replaced So I went into the store and dealt with a manager who was reluctant to just give me a new phone So with a reference number in hand from our online conversation the Samsung tech had me save I eliminated hours off my store visit The Samsung tech said there had been a small issue with funny acting phones and Samsung was aware of the problem He didnt try to lie He was upfront and honest Got to admire that I have owned several Samsung phones in the past Just recently bought a Samsung 55 curved 4k ultra TV And curved sound bar from best buy If it hadnt been for the customer service I would have just walked away So to sum up my experience the phone when replaced has worked great No problems nothing I would highly recommend this phone and will continue to purchase Samsung products Thanks the EDMONDS Family This is by far the best phone that I have ever used Crystal clear display and the wireless charging is fantastic Another iteration of a great and easy to use phone Feels great in the hand and the usual Android system that works great First off let ne clarify that i am a huge Galaxy series fan the notes and the Ss I have had mostly the notes in the past and was kind of sceptical on trying the s7 edge mostly because of the curved edges But i am an idiot because this phone is the best hands down i have gotten for both sides It has a very sexy sleek design the marshmallow operating system is pretty great The screen size isnt that big of a change from the note 4 i had The color and display to the phone is phenomenal The best feature to the phone is the battery it runs my phone pretty well and love the fast charging Inwould strongly recommend this phone to anyone if you are having trouble making a decision This phone has everything you could want and then some The reaction time when you want to do anything on the phone is outstanding When I purchased the Galaxy S6 Edge last year I was sure I was holding the holy grail of phones That was until I got the Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung keeps raising the bar and everyone else is just falling behind The design speed and overall performance is second to none There is Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and then there is everything else Nice phone to handle but still not as good as the S5 Nice not to have to worry about the battery running down when you use it all day Love the time display always on Camera and pictures are fantastic I absolutely love this phone its faster has a sleek look and is reliable So happy I finally have one I have found this phone great so far It runs smooth and the battery life is great my 4s I had to keep it on the charger constantly This one I use all day 8 hours and never put it on the charger I would still have about 20 life when I get home Just really nice Has many nice features easy to understand and use I upgraded form an S5 to the S7 Edge I really like it The first couple days I got Great battery life about 24 hours Then it slipped considerably to about 1216 hours probably due to an app I installed I just dont know which one The edge feature is very useful I especially like the night time edge clock Love love love this phone This is my firsr samsung product and i think im hooked now Ive had every samsung note except the 5 because of no expandable let memory I wish they had a removable battery but I can do without since it has a giant battery Hopefully the note 6 isnt better than this or Ill have to get that too I just love how the device is smaller and the screen is still almost the same size as the note If you like having Bluetooth WiFi and having a phone that doesnt randomly freeze and restart then dont buy this phone Ive had the phone for 3 weeks and now I cant connectfind any WiFi or Bluetooth connections The phone will also randomly freeze and reboot itself Its too late to return it so it looks like Im gonna have a useless phone till a software update comes out On my way to get a third exchange on this phone it keeps on turning off by itself the camera isnt what I was expecting and the battery life is terrible Love this phone fast Good camera has 93rd slot which is awesome Very sleek and smooth back A major plus The camera lens doesnt stick out like on the S5 Another major plus Overall the S7 is really awesome with the video call option The S7 is so much faster than my S3 The larger screen is nice too I love having the round charger to set the phone on for charging Everything works great Over an 8 hour period with my phone sitting in my car on airplane mode the battery life would drain to less than 50 My old S5 would be near 80 I factory reset the phone and it is much better in airplane mode Unfortunately when I actually use the phone the battery life is still rather bad

All the other great feature like samsung pay awesome camera water proof SD card go out the window if your battery is dead Good for the first few days and then slowed down Love the waterproof and dust resistance features though Glad to see it is waterproof great features but needs longer battery life Quick charge helps in that department Transfer from my S5 was quick and painless Rather expensive Sound when on the phone is clear and loud No problem pairing with all my Bluetooth devises Pictures much better than my S5 Faster focus time Most Apps work immediately after transfer Marshmallow 601 upgrade deleted Google Map without a warning There was some pretty tense times for a while when lost and expecting my phone to bail me out So far it is a pretty good phone I have had a number of samsung phones had the galaxy 345 skipped the six due to no sd card S7 is better than all previous versions Performance has taken a huge leap forward screen is amazing and battery life best it has been I bought the gold and love the way it looks Has held up well so far I really enjoy my S7 I waited to get it and it was worth it I upgraded from the S3 and havent missed a beat Going from the S5 to the S7 the overall ease of use is the same The camera and battery life have significantly improved The only thing Im bothered by is the removal of toolbox I used it regularly and miss it very much This new phone that Samsung has released is by far the best smartphone Ive ever seen and owned

This device is thin lightweight and fast With it being an android it has more bells and whistles than I thought or expected Awesome battery life and quick to recharge and absolutely priceless when it comes to performance and reliability 

Well done Samsung  The camera for one is a major upgrade and the battery life is a noticeable plus Its an amazing phone and with Samsung pay it makes my life easy for payments I got my phone on the release date and I just love it I swear Samsung always has the best phones The 7 has a real nice vivid screen great sound and a real decent battery and Im pretty hard on my phone as far as usage goes Features galore and Im still finding out new things to do with it even though Ive had it for a few weeks I also love the camera quality And the Camera has a lot of features and modes Im a Samsung girl for life I highly recommend this phone  Home Screen could have been better change Apps design so it dont looknlike old phones good that it works faster with internet but other than more memory space and finger print scanner i dont see no difference then my S5 Active a bit dissapointed but since my phone screen cracked and was due for a upgrade to the opportunity to try the S7 Its a great phone I really enjoy the new features that the Edge provides This phone is awesome in every way I had the IPHONE 6s and this phone blows it away I love the freedom and limitless experience The IPHONE seems so restrictive The apps function extremely well The IPHONE apps leave alot to desire Great job Samsung Look the speed call quality camera apps response time etc of the Galaxy S7 is terrific  a huge upgrade from my Galaxy S4 But the real triumph herethe screen Its beautiful I dont even know how to accurately describe the screen quality  its crystal clear light responsive and smooth and responsive to touch I am in love with this phone and so happy that I picked one up There may be a ton of advertising for this phone which usually turns me off of a product but you can trust itthis is a great phone The new Samsung galaxy improves a lot better when taking a pictureIt is so amazingthanks for that
It has video call also unlike previosold model Caller ID before you have to monthly fee just to have caller IDprices depends on your carrier but now you dont have to pay monthly just for that features which is great Phone has great battery life takes clear pictures I highly recommend this phone I have had it from day 1 and have not had a single problem with it Excellent graphics pics very clear and some with correct 3D glasses pics stand out sharp Excellent for the consumers who are swimmers and divers you can see time in water while swimming Ive had a iPhone for the past 6 years and finally made the switch over to the Galaxy family I was extremely afraid at first I can honestly say it was a great move Im so happy with their new line of products and cant wait for Gear VR to make it in the mail Love everything about itwould recommend it to a family Apsara load fast Screen is great  Love how the phone feels Great quality I have had my phone for a month now and let me tell you the processor speed is great though experiences that I have with video from the camera and the video recorder or grade I go to baseball games and record things and its phenomenal The screen size is great There are many great apps for this phone and plenty of accessories I also love the wireless charger which I also purchased Look feel build performance battery life features my favorite on this phone of any Ive ever used I still do not prefer Touch Wiz and its launcher as I feel it could be improved in some ways The ONLY negatives I have found one has to do with edge screen When holding the phone and any part of your hand is touching the edges the touch screen does not work Putting the phone in a case fixes that The other negative is the speaker It is small and lowsy All in all this is the greatest phone Ive ever used in all aspects The phone is lightweight waterproof and very user friendly Reason for being the best smart phone out is lets face it Its a Samsung Galaxy The features camera and just the experience of the phone makes other phone feel dummy downed including the iphone My brother and I where iPhone lovers until we received our first Samsung Galaxy and we never looked back at an iphone In my opinion the Samsung Galaxy is an adult phone and a iPhone is for kids not to say kids cant use a Samsung Galaxy because they can just as easy as an iphone The Samsung s7 is on point and other phones including iPhones are a second to the Galaxy Good bye Apple Hello Samsung great product love it Get this phone speed and specs and dependability all good points to this pbone This phone is incredible and actually pretty easy to use I am not sure I like the swipe edge yet but still love the phone
It takes amazing photos I absolutely recommend Galaxy S7 its faster Very sensitive Easy to browse that Internet I love the camera and all the effects My battery life holds longer than before Im in love with my phone and cant wait to use the VR The only issue Ive had is When my phone is plugged in to an auxiliary port and I turn on my Bluetooth headset it changes the sound to come out of my headset instead of my truck speakers 

I previously had the S4 and it connected it all just fine I work for a phone company the s7 is one of the strongest devices out  speed and power is what it pushes Its a SamsungBOOM I love love love this phone This is my 2nd samsung smart phone and Im very pleased love all the features and that it is waterproof is a plusI would highly recommend to family  friends and so far 2 friends have gotten the new samsung 7edge Its a great working phone Like all the features I had the galaxy s6 and was very displeased Im really really happy with the s7 aside from cracking my screen within 7 days Im now a little more cautious with the phone but overall performance is great Im in love with the camera and its my favorite samsung phone Ive owned and trust me Ive owned them all lol This is a great phone Its my 3rd Samsung Galaxy I like them so much better than The I phones Since having the S4 Active it has been very easy to get use to and to use  Just wish it was cheaper I switched from an iPhone when the Galaxy s4 came out I have never regretted it The phone is amazing keeps getting better and better Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is one of my great choices to buy I do have other Samsung products like the Galaxy S5 phones three of them for my children I decided to upgrade myself to the Galaxy S7 Edge cost of the features the memory what phone has so much memory and the camera I will love taking pictures of my children with this phone it captures everything 
Its so much easier to answer a phone call to get a message and as a mom whos not really smart with phones this one is very easy for me to understand I dont need to bother my children because I understand how to use this phone 
Everyday every minute Im using this phone for my coupons for my pictures and I never have to stop what Im doing I can always answer the phone and still and go back into what Im doing and still talk on the phone so if Im on the phone and Im searching for Google or I found on the phone and I need to look for something its very easy for me to work with this phone so Im very glad that I choose Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Thank you Bright display easy to use features not overly loaded with bloatware The Galaxy S7 Edge is extremely fast compared to my old Galaxy S4 The display on this phone is much better than the S4 also It is brighter more colorful and it responds to my finger much faster The camera for me is not that big of a deal but I played with it a little and really liked how fast it could focus and how clear it was at x8 zoom I like how they put the micro SD slot back in and added a curved back but wish it had a removable battery I would definetly recommend this phone who wants to have a great experience with a phone that can travel lightning fast I love the phone The camera is amazing the features are fabulous and it thinks on its own I have absolutely always loved samsung phones especially the line of galaxies Though by far the seven is my favorite Its sleek performs very well has an amazing battery life and a wonderful camera that works in all situations I love this phone It is user friendly and has more features than I could have expected The phone is great I love it Butthe screen breaks very easily Make sure you use a case the minute you get it I upgraded from the 6 edge to the 7 edge and have been absolutely pleased with my purchase The camera and phone are wonderfully diverse and well built This phone cured me of all my ailments I used to walk with a cane but not any more now that I have the Galaxy S7 Edge with its sleek design and lightning fast response Excellent Phone with great features Extremely fast Ive had several Samsung Notes before this and loved all of them This time when I saw the S7 edge and saw it wasnt much different in size I decided to give it a try Its awesome I like it even more than the Note The edge is really helpful when Im working Ive had this product for about 3 weeks and have loved it The OS is fast and smooth All of the features are great My only complaint is that due to the edge screen accidently selecting icons is very easy as the is no place to hold the phone without pushing something That will just take some getting used to Once my case arrived some of that issue has been resolved The best Samsung phone ever It has great features This product has great features It has a great camera its not to big and the edge makes it easier to get to your icons Overall this is the best phone available and I dont have one Negative comment The galaxy s7 edge is my all time favorite phone I will never go back to iPhone The features of the galaxy surpass all other phones and the size of this phone is perfect not to big and not to small I updated from a phone a few generations old and the S7 is overall better but dislike no longer having the options button also the keyboard seems less sensitive making it more difficult to text or use the calculator Otherwise the phone is great with much improvement What a great phone Its intuitive and very easy to use Just back up your files and apps and youre good to go I never felt that new phone glitchyness that happens when you switch Great phone I had a lot of phone this phone is light and easy to use with a lot of stuff you can do My 3rd or 4th Samsung device n the best 1 yet lover the style love the battery life love that they brought back memory card screen and cameras are awesome I like this product because it has a lot of great features and theyre easy to use Ive never owned a smartphone before but really havent had a lot of diifficulty learning about my new phone If you can operate a computer you can easily operate a smartphone I used to say that I wouldnt want a phone thst is smarter than I am but I have cjanged my mind I love the predicter on the text keyboard I told someone that I thought it could read my mind seriously I have never had a rext predicter that works so well It makes texting so much easier I especially like the feature where you can talk to the phone and it will type for you because It is so amaziningly accurate In fact Im using it right now and it does an excellent job This phone is really amazing little piece of equipment and I am really glad I went ahead and bought one
 Thank you so much and keep up the good work This phone lives up to the hype Its fast simple to use and great features The color options are a bit limited but easily forgotten when looking at the bright vivid display and using the dual megapixel camera and front flash The phone does everything I want it to and more Motion photo Samsung is must have and tells all The s7 edge has a beautiful screen Great curves that make the phone stand out an draw to attention I honestly aint 100 sure about the edge screen though It does make the phone look sexy but as far as it being a necessary feature Id say no Its really more a glorified convo piece Expandable storage and waterproof Check Cant say nothing wrong with the phone at all I have had my hands on almost all of your Galaxy phones You see I am a caregiver and med tech so I am working in situations where my phone can be easily dropped on the floors as well as in toilets and let me just say it has happened more times then Id like to admit And I use my phone on aa day to day basis From entertainment for an upset resident with good old music to calling the nurse or an ambulance I rely on My phone constantly Lets me start with the s5 for a moment When I got that phone it was great However when they claim it was water resistant I was so happy about that feature I went ahead abd got it One splash later as it fell from my hands and right into the cold water of the toilet all the while having the EMTs on the phone needless to say it didnt make thw cut and it died a horrible death So to me that is a selling point A phone that can handle the job Let me just say The S7 has already seen a cup of water due to a resident trying to clean my phone Ill tell you this its still working and has not had a single problem So aside from that The picture quality is beyond words my pictures cone out looking amazing evwn through the eyes and thumbs She loves taking pictures The sound Oh yes the sound is clear right along with screen resolution to be honest I have been watching my shows and movies on my phone more then I do on my big 3D HDTV The phone is lightweight great size not to big and not to small for constant holding I would highly recommend this phone Oh Dont let me forget Its got expandable memory I always wanted 6 edge and then galaxy 7 edge came way more better than its predecessor I love it My wife have galaxy 7 but she envys on my galaxy 7edge And waterproof I never have to worry about getting it wet Thank you for this awesome phone The camera is the best camera Ive seen on any phone GET IT Cant put it on speaker without the other caller not being able to hear you volume isnt loud slow touch doesnt charge fast I was so excited about my new Samsung Galaxy S7
Its all they say it is and more Its like a boss
I highly recommend this smartphone
If your looking for a device with a ton of memory space look no further out of the box 32g64g if thats not enough you can add additional 200g with a micro SD card into the dedicated slot The Android OS is the new v60 marshmallow Wow is all Im saying Anyways The S7 comes with a Super Amoled capacitive touchscreen display 16m colors
The body is made up of Corning Gorilla Glass back panel And the S7 IP68 certified  dust proof  water resistant over 15 meters for 30 minutes Thus being the best smartphone Ive ever held imo Im not done
If those specs havent sold you on this device then how about its 12MP camera w phase detection auto focus OIS LED flash HDR Video To power this beast
of a phone it comes with a non removable LiIon 3000
mAh battery super fast charge times talk time up to 22h 3G music play up to 62h and the software is just to much to list but hands down this phone is such a great phone Im glad I own one its a must have Hope this review helps you make a decision to get yours Having own and used the Note 1 2 3  4 I am happy that Samsung listened to their loyal customers and brought back the removable SD card THANK YOU This phone has awesome features camera and feel I have thoroughly enjoyed it It exceeded my expectations and I will continue to be a loyal Samsung user for years to come I had my last phone for 4 years I recently upgraded and got my Samsung Galaxy and the features are just amazing I realize my phone was old but this new one is like high Def compared to my old phone and so much faster I love the fact I can do so much at once My mom had a Samsung Galaxy s5 and I can do so much more with my s7 than she can Now she is jealous and wants to upgrade hers  I got this for my wife and she loved it It is everything she looked for in a smart phone This phone is great Its snappy performance from the Snapdragon 820 processor is more than enough for the average smartphone user but this phone is more than just average The sleek design is comfortable in the hand At a 51 inch screen display the screen to phone ratio is outstanding I hat phones that are too big or too small its right in the middle After being an s7 owner for almost a month I can say that when it comes to features this has them except the IR blaster we seen in previous phones This feature might of been sacrificed to make room for other components which Im fine with Great work Samsung Sleek sexy and satisfying Great camera and welcome back memory card slot Fast stylish and awesome all around phone I would buy another one I absolutely love my Galaxy S7 Has many useful features not loaded with stuff that takes space Speaking of space love the fact that I can insert a large chip to add space Great for musicvideo and photo lovers such as myself I had the Galaxy 5 and upgrade to this version I love this The battery life is better on this version but best of all is the wireless charging option I love this part Easy to lay on charger while working at desk quick pick up and gone I absolutely love my new phone I was able to figure out how to use it very quickly and so far I am totally satisfied with all options it has to offer If you love 3D check out this amazing vibrant illusive display So clear and pictures are great If I was to rename it I would call it the S7 Smooth Phone So smooth and elegant even aliens use it I would have a Comercial that shows aliens talking on S7 Smooth phones Just the name makes me wonder if Samsung could pull it off Introducing the new S7 Smooth

Names I would call it
S7 SMOOTH 
S7 WONDER
S7 CURVE
S7 ALIEN

Any thoughts Samsung

Finally yes this phone is truly awesome and thank you for adding the slot for more memory Sounds great color Tatanium love it Everything on this phone simply rocks I only had 1 hiccup with a dead pixel but it was replaced immediately so no complaints here Love the fast operation and extended battery life I have invested in a great product I am not unhappy that I got this phone The phone feels good in my hand I really like being able to see the date and time whenever I take it out of my pocketThe fingerprint feature works a lot better then on the S5 Taking pictures is so much easier and the quality is a lot better I watched a demonstration of its water resistance for two and a half hours in a picture of water and was quite impressed I will recommend this phone to anyone that asked me good job Samsung I love the Samsung Galaxy phones and the s7 does not disappoint The batteryear lasts forever and I game a lot on my phone the storage is huge and can be upgraded with an SD card The picture the camera takes are better the most of the digital camera I have had
 The phone is got gereat noise reduction you dont have the crack and wind noise anymore I love my s7 I would recommend the s7 to everybody I love samsung in every way I think their products are always unique and user friendly Every person can add a different flare to their phone The battery life is amazing The camera is outstanding My only complaint includes people often call me and it seems to not go through I was an iPhone 6 plus user but switched to the Galaxy S7 edge and never looked back Identical screen size but the S7E has a slimmer profile I am now recommending Galaxy phones to friends and family Phone has great features and accessories but is fraglie do to it being glass on the front and back This phone is great it does all the things I need it to and more I love how Samsung added an option to throw an SD card in for that extra memory the size is great fits perfectly in my hand it is super fast and the feel of the phone is sturdy it does not feel like it will break easily Really fast phone plus the samsung gear vr is the new thing Samsung never lets their fan base down Also the camera focus is just amazing Fastest focus on a phone This phone has never let me down in regards to speed Im not dropping calls any longer and it also takes fantastic pictures Even motion pictures The battery life is awesome the phone is water resistant Great camera not too big still learning the amazing features The expectation made by Samsung about the S7 edge has left me wanting more from this device I utilize my handheld devices like a tablet or laptop Only the S6 Edge Plus has met my needs with this regard This device is great in every other aspect The Galaxy S7 Edge has great screen resolution fast and great battery life Best phone on the market right now Samsung did wonderful Ive had a couple Samsung phone before but moved to another brand when they stopped being memory upgradable The new S7 edge met all of my precious expectations and needs with room to spare I like the design functionso and ease of use 

It is a great phone with software update i lose wifi option then have to factory reset phone The screen is the perfect size with a good feel to it The camera makes everything looks better than real life Great phone awesome features would recommend This is a great phone The battery lasts longer than my old one did and has the quick charge feature I also like the edge menu so that I can find all my apps quickly on the side of my screen I dont have to fill up my screen with apps if I dont want them there but I can still use them easily Intuitive controls make this phone easy to It has great features as well Really the only downside is that there is not a removable battery All in all I love it I have been an iPhone user since I could remember and my husband talked me into getting the Galaxy S7 I was nervous at first because it was going to be completely different and I am glad I did The features are amazing camera is the best I have ever seen I love all of the different customizations I can do and the best feature is that its water proof Something you need with a toddler running around Best phone I have ever used and plan on sticking with the Galaxy series For the past 3 years I have been using the Iphone 5 and 6plus I have always been a fan of android but my job required the iphone now I have a new job and I could choose between the Samsung S7 and the Iphone 6s I made the jump back to android although I have had many android tablets over the past 5 years
What I like 
1The screen is awesome although i wish it were bigger rich colors fast response smooth scrolling
2Touchwiz  its come a long way from my galaxy tab I actually like it better than my native google interface i have on my nexus tablet Samsung really improved the interface and got rid of much of the complexity and i get the number of notifications on the icons of many apps that is one thing i liked about apple
3Finger Print Unlock  works way better than my gen1 Iphone 6 I was able to program 4 fingers
4Fast Charge  its fast much faster than I anticipated
5Camera  faster than my iphone 6 better low light pictures
6Button locations  very ergonomic the location of the power button is perfect I never accidentally turn off my phone like i did with my iPhone
7integration of apps  this is one thing Apple does not offer I understand that security and performance are at risk but Ill take the risk to have the options 
8back button 

What I dont like
1Battery life  The battery drains fast although it never accelerates like my iPhone did it drains at a steady rate I can get about 12 hours out of a charge with moderate use if i am using it a lot probably 4 to 5 The fast charging helps with this I never really feel like ill be stuck as long as i can plug in somewhere for 10 minutes
2google apps that work better on my iphone than my s7 really no excuse
3microUSB ugghhhh why I would rather have a thicker phone and use the USBC the microusb is poor and is always the first thing to break

The only concern I have is product updates In the past Samsung is slow to update the OS and will only provide updates for the first year Hopefully things have changed My nexus tablet is 25 yrs old and I still get updates it keeps the system running clean and fast Samsung Galaxy is the best smartphone on the planted Enough said I really love the galaxy S7 and all its capabilities like the under water feature and how you can have it in the pool up to 5 ft And I love the camera on it It takes amazing photos I recommend that everyone should get this phone It has everything you could ever want on it I had the S4 before getting a S7 Edge This phone is a million times better than my old one I love the phone It feels nice in the hand is extremely fast and smooth and takes great pictures I would recommend this phone to anyone needing a new phone This phone is wonderful I have always loved the galaxy phones but this one is by far the best one I have owned The edge is lightweight and super easy to hold and the design is sexy Really recommend this phone just on design but the screen quality is also wonderful All around great phone Best purchase I have been a long time Samsung customer I started with a Note 2 graduated to a Note 4 and now I am on my S7 It was a little big of a leap for me to go from the Note 4 to the S7 but as the days have gone by I dont miss it that much I am tough on phones and so the S7 is a great fit for me this thing is almost indestructable Between it being built tough water resistant that was enough for me I hope to have this phone for sometimewell at least until Samsung comes out with the next best thing Ive had this phone for just 1 12 weeks but I am loving it Many great features long lasting battery life and a phenomenal camera after I figured out why when I tried to zoom I ended up with 12 shots of the same thing Needed to reconfigure buttons The camera is the best I have ever seen Focuses instantly Love it  vr gear is hot no complaints keep making the best products every time I was going to an iPhone you guys pull me in Love the design and the edge apps display camera and samsung pay This is an the best Samsung Phone yet It is completely user friendly and customizable It is light and can fit in your shirt pocket The colors are bright and vivid Worth every penny I want to start off by saying that Samsung is the best product money can buy I wouldnthe be comfortable without a Samsung product I just got the S7 Edge a couple of weeks ago and I love it The size physical features and the over aspects of the phone Its the perfect size I would recommend this phone to anyone I will always be a Samsung customer The Galaxy s7 continues the strong legacy of the Galaxy smartphone models bringing more processing power additional functionality and improvements in overall design Its hard to believe the prior models could have been improved upon but the s7 has done that The builtin speakers the HD voice the new camera along with all the camera functionality the sealed design that helps to protect against moisture unbelievably sharp display with the option for an always on clock the ability to display two applications on the screen fast charging and long battery life per charge this is what all smartphones should aspire to be This phone isnt the first flagship phone from Samsung that hit every mark it aimed for but its the first that hit every single one with style and more Whether its the battery that actually lasts a full day with intensive use To the screen which is almost the same size as the Galaxy Note Edge screen but in a slimmer more sleeklooking package A wellrounded back facing and front facing camera a beautiful vibrant screen that beats anything in the market This phone its the first phone I I didnt hesitate to buy over its competitors This phone I am proud to show off and everyone who sees that I have it knows that I have the best phone on earth for the upcoming future Pat yourselves on the back Samsung because if this is there golden standard you put your phones up to consider me a loyal customer for life Better battery 3600 milli amps Waterproof SD card up to 200GB wireless charging great features amazing screen and the BEST camera of any phones Way to go Samsung absolutely brilliant This phone totally changed my whole life this is one of the best phones in the world in my opinion what does everything I needed to do and more without crashing or for closing battery is amazing features are fantastic durability a plus plus Size is perfect runs great and the battery is awesome also love the quality of the camera Tgis lhone is great for any active person The waterproofness is awasome for parents The ease of use is amazing Love this new phone Thank you for bringing back expandable memory I love all the features that I have found so far and the ease of use I love this phone Its fast and got a beautiful design My favorite phone so far Ive always had a Samsung and this phone is Amazing just like my S3 S4 S5 and S6great features and beautiful I am so happy with this phone I originally purchased the s6 edge when it came out and returned it for the note 4 for two reasons1st the SD card was a major down side for me 2nd the size seemed small going to the s6 edge from the s5 I loved my note 4 but love the s7 edge so much more So happy to have the SD card slot back The size is perfect as well Never had a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and I love my s7 Im so glad I upgraded Only thing that I was disappointed with was the battery life on this phone I use my Samsung GALAXY S7 edge almost every minute of every day and it last me the entire day I love the battery life I was surprised how much I used the edge features and love the fact that this phone is water resistant I love the Galaxy s7 it has great features really quite easy to use Pictures come out clear even in low lighting Im sure theres still features that I havent yet discovered Theres an app called Samsung  that is quite helpful My only issue is that without some kind of a case the phone is rather slippery I would recommend this phone Ive had my galaxy s7 edge for about a month now and I gotta say I really like it The display is beautiful the edge features are great the phone is very responsive and the addition of the SD card slot and water resistance is great The only con I have is the speaker I came from a nexus 6p great phone I just prefer samsung which had dual front speakers and they sound amazing Overall the Samsung s7 edge is a great device and I highly recommend it This is a great phone with really nice features It has nice curves The performance is fast It is also easy to use The themes are also a great thing too Lots of great features like Much Improved Edge Screen
Would like to see more Features in SView  Clear View cases
Works great in the Gear VR Warming up for Oculus Rift  HTC Vive Yes I want both
Battery is slight improvement over my S6 Edge Plus
Sometimes closing my SView Screen it is trying to open a split window Not sure what thats about
Samsung has by far the best predictive typing 2 letters is usually all I have to type to have my email come up Blows away the iPhone predictive text which is actually quite dumb in my opinion  yes Ive actually owned an iPhone  iPad so Im not fanboying here Camera is spectacular in low light Samsung make all other phones look like a joke Screen is actually readable in sunlight my iPhone Fanboyish buddy was even impressed

Being an Edge Screen can sometimes be prohibitive like using it for your Boarding Pass or showing photos to friends they almost always hit escape or the multitasking button or the edge display

Overall with the couple of quirks much like any phone its by far the best phone Ive owned I really love the phone and how it curvesI love the feature you have on the phone and how fast it moves and how you brought back the sd cardYou will defiently get more people to switch to Samsung Simplicity the over all technology of the s7 edge is spectacular the clarity of pictures and screen resolution is just awesome The Galaxy S7 is really a fantastic Phone Beautifully designed the S7 feels great in your hand 

The camera is unmatched by any smartphone on the market The camera focus is shockingly fast which leads its self to taking crispy photos quickly The screen is also one of the best I have seen

I only wish I could have bought this phone straight from Samsung without the ATT software Great phone so far nice and fast It has a beautiful sleek look to it especially the gold 
Takes great pictures and is the perfect size My only complaint is that it heats up fairly quickly even when just reading a few articles The phone is light weight and has a fantastic bright display It runs multiple applications smoothly and doesnt use a lot of resources The battery life is excellent and also charges very fast The only complaint I have is the speaker is not loud at all but still the phone is great and really is worth every penny I upgraded from a g4 Liked it but I was constantly running out of room I love the space on the 7 with the ability to upgrade the SD card Its a plus The only problem Im having is syncing it to my chartet account I am receiving emails but I cant send them Neither charter or Verizon were able to help me But otherwise the phone is awesome It is a great phone and has new features for the quick access edge tab It definitely feels more comfortable on my hand Would recommend I really love the phone its by far the best android device Ive owned the only complaint i have is you removed the ir sensor I love peel remote and cant use it anymore  This is by far the best phone Samsung has put out Its unbelievably fast and the camera is beyond any other camera on a phone out there The shutter speed is immaculate that you almost wonder if you just really took a picture I highly recommend this phone to anyone I know I cant believe how long the charge lasts and how quick it is to charge on the newer quick and fast chargers Every day I find something new cool and better than my last phone The backlight on this phone is so crisp and clear I have nothing bad to say about this phone This is my first samsung phone I have bought tablets And HD TVs As always this phone is top notch I have no glitches Phone far exceeded my expectations The color on the screen is amazing The Camara does things a pro Camara does Plus all the Samsung gear that you can use It makes ever day life fun I will have to say this is the best phone ever owened I started with the galaxy S2 and let me say they have come a long way I really enjoy each phone s2s5 but the S7 comes with a well design great specifications and beautiful display Good fit on your hand and pictures are well captured I love the sleek design of this phone I love it is the perfect size and weight I have had the pleasure of having a few of the different galaxy phones over the years and have to say this is amazing I was so thrilled with the option of the memory card The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is an awesome phone and I love all the features about this device I stepped down from the Note 4 and I love that I made this decision The edge style of the phone is what peak my interest I definitely recommend this phone to any and everybody I can Love it SD card great display excellent camera good sound good size great battery Yes the title is a bit misleading as this is hardly a phone its a high end camera computer personal assistant heck id even say it could be an action camera 

you name it this phone will do it with easy 

I have had every iteration of Sams since the S3 including the Note 3 and 4 as well as many of the Galaxy tabs by far and away this is the best device i have EVER used 

oh and my list of devices goes on for days probably something from every major company I am truly happy with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had the Galaxy S5 and was very disappointed on how the battery life was horrible This new phone last me all day without charging it and even has enough battery for the day after as well The processor in this phone works excellent as well and makes it run smooth while I run and use all my favorite apps I was very happy to upgrade from the S5 to the S7 I decided not to go with the edge and I do not regret it at all The low light camera on the S7 is 1000x better than the S5 Most of the same functions are there but with updates for faster performance additional personalizing options and increased storage S5 was only 16 S7 is the 32 The screen size is the same but the phone itself is slimmed down as well So far I am very happy with my new phone and believe it was worth spending the money on it The only think I do not like is the phone automatically wakes up when a text message comes through  but sometimes it just wakes up randomly when nothing has happened Its not a big deal but just a quirk it has Great phone Love that the SD slot is back as well as the water resistant feature The processor and battery are amazing I had an iPhone 6s and once I saw the s7 edge I immediately sold the iPhone to purchase the s7 edge I would totally recommend this phone to anyone Ive had Iphones and Galaxy phones and this has been the best I keep learning new things everyday about what I can do with it The only disappointment I have is that it doesnt have retinal recognition The phone itself is a powerpacked sleek and beautiful device Hardware is second to none it looks good and has more speed than I know what to do with That all contributing to one of the best devices I have had to honor to lay my hands on Now the negative the wifi is unstable and it seems to hate my 60mb connection through my airport extreme gen 5 I should have no issues with that set up Ao in closing the almost perfect phone is hindered by a software issue please fix this Samsung I just got my S7 and it spellchecks things like there and were to I and its kind of passing me off Other than that though its a wonderful phone The expandable memory makes it so much more worth it than the Note 5 which I had before The phone is great but wish it had the rugged properties of the Samsung Galaxy active I never thought I would leave my Galaxy Note but the S7 edge has stole my attention I love the design Screen display is clear and perfect size Im now S7 edge team I only use Samsung products and i had the S6 Active which was having issues and i upgraded to the S7 and im happy i spent the moneyawesome phone the s7 takes unbelievable photos battery life has improved but still not satisfactory Sets the standard for smart phones It preforms amazingly and is very stylish Im very happy with the expandable memory I love everything about this phone and continually find new features I am a Note for user and always have been I decided to try the s7 Edge since it was close to the Note size I really enjoy this phone and the features Good job Samsung Ive had a few iPhones a Galaxy s5 and now the s7 This is the best phone yet I ABSOLUTELY love the camera The quality and the lighting feature is amazing My photos come out so professional looking I can print and share with ease As far as other apps and features it just keep consistent with the Samsung screen It does run incredibly fast however Faster than any other phone I have previously owned Not to mention I love the gold color mine is Nice phone Nice pictures This is my first android phone and I am happy with it Phone came with OK Google feature like Siri which worked for the first few days and then suddenly stopped working I miss it Please fix this app having this was so nice Also like the slide out drawer like thing the memory card goes into instead of removing battery Switching bw internal memory and storage can be a little confusing at times for a new Android user I guess but very happy with the option to add storage Overall very happy with this phone and my choice to switch I had always owned other smartphones but after trying the S4  now upgrading to the S7 I will never stray away from the Samsung Galaxy S phones This is my first smart phone I have been looking for awhile for a new phone  I saw this one  I knew this was the one for me It is user friendly  is easy to navigate around The screen is crystal clear I am really enjoying playing around with the phone I love my new purchase I love this phone My son fried on last phone which was a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I really liked that phone but this phone is so much better Love it So far I feel that this is the best Galaxy phone to date Keep up the great work Samsung I had a galaxy mega thought i couldnt live without a big phone but when you get the big top of the line phone which is sleek fast can do everything you need and more it makes it all the worth while happy with purchase samsung has never let me down teamsamsung The galaxy line keeps getting better and better Ive had them since the first one This one incorporates all the good features that were found in the S5 plus the beautiful design of the S6 Love it I have been a samsung user for 4 years now and I absolutely have loved every minute of it 
Despite the wifi issues this phone is great
The speakers are amazing I bought this phone only a week and half Just today the screen went completely black but the phone itself was working still The customer support walked me through a few reset features and was able to rebook my cell I told him I was very concerned that such a new phone would do this and he assured me it would be fine I am getting ready to ship our old phones back and it truly makes me nervous Besides that the phone is a bit touchy on the various screens Its very fast and love most of the new features I also notice the battery does not last all day if I am on it playing a quick game or checking out FB The S7 Edge is an awesome phone I love all of the Samsung products and features I like how I can check my texts on the Edge without having to turn the phone on And the quick app features with the Edge is great too I did not expect to have great video and picture quality Is the battery life isnt that long last maybe a few hours When in constant use other wise it lasts all day so a bigger battery for the people that like to use there cellular device I have had the S7 Edge for a couple of weeks now and I love it Switching from the S4 its quite the uprade It is great not having to worry about the battery the Galaxy S7 excels in every aspect that the S6 fell short in the GS7 brought back expandable memory and an IP68 rating Its beauty and function all packed into one the camera is spectacular on the GS7 especially in lowlight settings it outperforms the competition Pair the upgraded camera with the wireless charging and its already formidable right out of the box Upgraded from S 4 This phone has an amazing display I find myself watching more movies and playing games on the edge than on any of my other tablets Storage is larger than I will ever be able to fill up Especially with the expandable memory Easy to use cool design great features Only downside is that the speaker gets shaky after it is wet After having my S7 for a few weeks I am thrilled to say that Im even happier now than I was when I first got it Its amazing the speed design camera are all top notch Bravo Samsung The shutter speed is really fast The camera has nice quality The G7 is faster clearer and sharper than a anything out there The best Galaxy phone yet So happy they brought back the expandable memory I love my new galaxy So many features they thought of everything So far so good being tech challenged I am muddling my way along with my new phone I like it so far and am learning by trial and error about its many features and uses
A little nicer than my last phone Would recommend to anyone Everything I need in a phone and lots of things I didnt even know I wanted but appreciate now that Ive been using them The phone has great clarity photos are easy to take with the double tap feature and its nice to know its waterproof to 5 ft just in case it ends up in the water I got this phone to sync with my Samsung smart watch I did not realize how good the sound was and the other great features like Word etc I ɱѳѵɛɗ Բʀѳɱ ɑ ร4 tѳ tɦɛ S7 ɑɳɗ I ʀɛɑʆʆy ʆikɛ ɑʆʆ tɦɛ ɳɛw Բɛɑtuʀɛร They brought back expandable memory and improved on an already great line up of Galaxy phones Samsung has really put together a great phone with this one They improved on some features that were lacking like size of the battery and brought back some things they took away like expandable memory I can find fault in anything if look hard enough but this phone really does not have any Anything that I could say is a fault can easily be fixed I do wish it had a removable battery still but the new design that limits that feels great in my hand 


Pros
 great screen
 large battery
 EXPANDABLE MEMORY IS BACK
 water resistancy

Cons
 a little large in the handvery tall but one hand operating mode fixes that
 non removable would be nice to have
 price point closer to the regular s7 would be nice I like the features Its better than previous phones My S7 has become permanent attached Everytime I put it down another reason to pick it back up pops into my head Why settle for apples when the galaxy can be held in your hand I love the edge on this phone One amazing product that Samsung came up with I love this phone Amazing phone This is my 5th galaxy phone and its the best galaxy phone Ive owned by far Easy to use Dull if great features This phone is easy to use It is has a sleek sophisticated look to it I like the way I can pull different features up off the edge The camera takes wonderful pictures The fast charge feature is very helpful I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a newer model I love this new phone Its amazing I love the screen and I especially like all the personalizing I can do with this phone 
My only real negative comment I guess is that the font apps haven quite caught up with this new phone and the Marshmallow system 
I LOVED being able to switch out my fonts on my S6 edge and now I cant do that because the top googled font apps arent able to work with my new S7  Been waiting for this phone and am glad I did No disappointments just a solid phone and awesome experience Its better than an iPhone Ive had 2 Samsung phones before and this is the lightest phone with the best quality for pictures and then new features are even better especially being waterproof Before I got the gs7 I have the gs5 loved the phone I bought the gs7 because you added the expand your memory of your phone and the water resistant feature Plus you added the fast charge I really like that you upgraded the soft ware as well I could keep this going all day but I have to say Im hooked on samsung and will keep getting them I love this phone so much I went from a Galaxy Note Edge its a bit smaller but its faster and love love the camera The new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is an amazing phone The Samsung s7 is remarkable in every way Samsung has thought of everything Guide and videos right on the phone to enable you to quickly learn and enjoy your new phone I can see the face of the phone even in sunlight and turn it on with my fingerprint The battery lasts for 12 hours and get the fast charger cradle 50 charge in barely 30 min The speaker is the best and loudest I have ever had The camera is fantastic with lots of choices Send a voice text or type or talk for script The Samsung s7 has totally exceeded my expectations I have had my phone for almost a month This phone never stops surprising you There are so many great features and the battery life is absolutely amazing I love Samsung product for years keep up the good work and keep bringing out more products I most definitely will continue to buy Samsung productsI love my phone I will keep buying the Samsung family I have had iPhones and other Galaxys but this is the most responsive fastest phone right out of the box Great display The edge screen took a few days to get used to but I love it too One of the best yet Many more improvements from the S4 I am enjoying the larger memory that is built in and longer lasting battery Easy to use I am definitely staying with the Samsungsame for future phones I like the phone however it had a few kinks I couldnt connect it to my phone system in my jeep I also had a few issues where I couldnt get data however a sim card change seemed to fix this problem My chief complaint is the battery life I do recommend getting battery saving apps No one even noticed it being an s7 thought it was the 5 I love my new galaxy S7 edge its smooth and it works great and I love the design and how they kept it similar as the S6 edge I would recommend this new phone A well deserved update to my former G4 phone which I had for over two years Love the S7 edge fast easy to use and awesome screen visibility Highly recommend That only down fall is not to the phone but there is not a phone case and screen protector for it yet Perfect in every way Best smartphone in the market This is the most wonderful awesome phone Ive ever owned This phone is really fantastic beautifully designed very responsive a must buy This phone is a great build It feels wonderful in your hand to the point that I dont want to put a case on it The battery life is phenomenal Coming from a Galaxy S5 this phone blows away my previous device My wife uses a Galaxy S6 Edge and I love that my S7 Edge has the best features from the two previous models Easily the fastest most reliable piece of tech Ive owned in a while 1010 would recommend This is a great phone Wish that they had a curved tempered glass screen protector This phone is superb The display is magnificent The engine is slick And the camera is phototastic Love the S7 Edge and what Samsung has done Could have been priced a little lower but otherwise its the best phone out there It is like 3 d I love this phone I would get another one its size is great its light weight an thin good grafics on the phone I think Im gone get my kids one I just switch from iPhone 6S to a beautiful and amazing Samsung Galaxy edge 7

Im very happy with my Samsung Galaxy Edge 7
I also bought the s Gear 2 and works perfect with the phone 
You can replay text  whatsapp check your mail use a GPS
And many many more 
The Gear 2 is the perfect combination 
Also excellent battery life and very elegant design 
I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy edge 7 
And the gear S2 Phone seems to preform well so far not that I am an expert with new tech I am pretty happy with it so far though I do notice some glitches from time to time with responce times The biggest I notice it seems every time I use it though When you try to insert a photo into a message it will freeze and sometimes takes more than one try to get it to work or come through I can guarantee it to fail the first try every time though But overall pretty good phone This is good product from Samsung Galaxy but expensive Nice design and good features like water proof and always on display but edge screen is no that much usefull Nice i liked it and i will use it 3 years that is more than my iphone5c 2 years Samsung and Android together leads the mobile device industry The Samsung Galaxy S7 was an incredible purchase for myself It gives me everything that I was looking for within a phone The look is sleek and wonderful The screen resolution is next to none and the performance of the processor is great I love the fact the its water resistant and that the camera has dual lens technology It makes it so much easier to take beautiful pictures in the lower light cloudy day settings I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 to anyone who is looking for the perfect device that just isnt a phone but a superior device This phone is much better then the s3 I had before I went to the iPhone Which I hated I love the Samsung products they are user friendly and light weight It was a little expensive but I got over that quickly when I saw all of the features and easeofuse The handset feels great everything about it is Sleek and smooth but the inside is the real deal There are so many different futures then my Galaxy S5 and they are so much easier to use I am not very Tech knowledgeable but even can work these features and the ones that I cant I am learning to use quickly and easily Like I said a little pricey but when you see all that it can do youll agree is that it is worth every penny Best phone I have ever owned and I have owned alot Completely user friendly in ever aspect The camera is amazing even underwater Although be sure to let it completely dry out for a couple of hours if u are going to be using headphones or other port jacksI am not that tech savvy but this phone makes me feel like Im a genius Go Samsung also other devices work well and sync up with no extra thought just press sync and you are good to go Thank you Samsung for making my life that much easier Love my new Samsung S7 Great camera and features Way better than the S7 Edge which broke the first week I had it when I only dropped it 12 inches and it hit the glass on the side I love this phone and love samsung products because they have something for every budget Samsung S7 Edge is a nice phone to own

Pros 
Design and feel in the hand Amazing 
Spectacular display  I was sold for just that
Amazing camera
Best rest of the specs and performance I havent found fault of
Battery is pretty good that was the most worried aspect before I bought but now I am at ease and happy
TouchWiz gives a nice feel

Cons
Edge features I havent used it even a day I bought edge knowing I wont use features in it but the embossed view of the screen it gives
Edge sometimes makes you accidentally trigger actions And when ur hand touches the edge sometimes the device doesnt recognizes the touch in rest of the screen Thats sometimes annoying but I believe its getting used to factor or expect samsung to fix it
ATT and samsung apps that i cant remove They dont harm me but I hate this violation of my right to decide what to keep and what not to as an owner This phone has great featuresit is affordableand valuable to haveIt is very light in weighteasy to navigate through the features I also like the video calling feature on these phone it is fantasticIt has colourful and very bright displayThis durable phone i will recommend to friends and family Love the phone Fast friendly and very easy to use It has everything I want and ever need in a smart phone
Its basically my computer and my phone Very nice device but most ever same as to Galaxy S6 Edge Better Processor Better Power 
But very fragile My phone fell down form about 3 feet in the driveway and shattered both sides badly within 1st week of purchase Had to pay another 200 to get it from insurance ive had a couple tvs and 3 different generation galaxys from samsung they havent disappointed me yet I use the edge features as short cuts everyday Had anot her brand phone before this and actually bought it out to make the change

Glad I made the move I have been enjoying my new phone Highly recommend it to everyone Thanks Samsung The phone exceeded my expectations The water proof feature was tested fully when my son accidentally put it at the bottom of a lake about 4 feet deep It took me 25 minutes to get it out of the water Three weeks later and the phone looks even better  perfectly functioning During the same trip it was dropped again by my son accidentally from around 7 ft into a pure concrete slap no scratches not even on the beautiful edge screens  How amazing ah Husband loves the new phone He jumped on board with the S6 while I kept the S5 My battery life has always been much better and he had an issue dropping calls on the S5 unless the higher call features were on However when you turned those on you couldnt talk and emailtextuse the GPS at the same time Everything is all fixed with the S7 Battery life is back all the features work again and his phone is faster than my S5  which makes him happy having the superior phone  Boys with toys I had the S4 for 3 years before I decided to upgrade I love this phone

Just one thing I wish they still had the old music player This s7 is a definite improvement over the s5 Its sleeker faster and better quality Im a satisfied customer Great phone I really like the Smart Switch feature Made the transition from the old device much easier than it was in the past

However I am sure there is a technical reason to make the back of the phone out of glass But from a user perspective even with a case a 2 foot drop to concrete screwed up my device for the next two years Cracked back cover through and through Every time I use it I will be reminded how this is a poor user experience decision I have owned several different phones from Motorola Droid Maxx to iPhone to galaxy The Galaxy S7 has the best of all phones The screen is gorgeous and crystal clear The photos are excellent I am a photographer  

The call quality is great Internet connections are without delay When display settings are
on Amoled Photo the battery lasts about 24 hours 

I have not had a single complain so far I highly recommend thisvphone I only had it for a week and it started freezing the side bar is annoying I cant believe I bought this phone is should have stayed with boost mobile nobody even knowso what phone it is when I try to show it off lol because when you hold it up you cover the name with the fingers Why the heck did the camera de_grade to 12 I wish I can return it but I cant Switched to Verizon and got the S7 and a second one for my girlfriend for free We absolutely love this phone Camera is excellent lot of great features speaker is awesome Call quality could be a BIT better but thats less to do with the phone Recommened I bought this phone on pre order The battery lasts almost 24 hours the trick is in settings Go to Display and Wallpaper scroll to Screen Mode and change it to either AMOLED photo I use that or AMOLED Cinema It comes set on Adaptive display which does eat the battery Fast processor beautiful photos clear calls Seems to have the best features of all phones I have had Iphones Droids and Galaxy I highly recommend this one I have had this phone for a short time I upgraded from the S4 I tend to keep my phones for a couple of generations as it take a minute to become comfortable with each new device So far I can tell you this The Galaxy S7 Edge is a VERY slick looking feeling and operating device The battery life is fantastic the screen is simply amazing and I am very happy I upgraded It also is visually stunning Whenever I bring the device out people want to see it That is not important to me at all I just mentioned it to support the point I will probably keep this device until the S9 or S10 comes out but I very pleased with this phone Had my phone for 2 weeks now Great phone Pefect size and excellent perform I upgraded my S5 to the S7 edge It is by far the best phone that I have owned Mostly Samsung products But I do have an issue with my other S7 edge The lock button and volume button quit working days after I received it The camera and video quality are outstanding Very easy to navigate Love it I have owned iPhones for the past 4 years I have not so patiently awaited for this exact phone to come out Expandable memory extremely quick processor water resistant ergonomically pleasing I just cant say enough To me personally this phone is a game changer Brilliant display and with the accessories that go with it you cant go wrong Im in a Galaxy all my own now Wireless charging water resistant fast easy external data storage beautiful design long battery life OMG Best Camera EverI am asked daily what phone is thatand then everyone wants one Samsung hit another home run with the Galaxy 7 edge I really like the features and sleekness of the phone However i still find some lagg happening from time to time with high impact apps and even Snapchat Keepy up the good work Android forever Samsung has totally won me over these last 3 years Everything they come out with is cutting edge and exceptional quality I now own a Samsung TV phone and watch Every device runs smoothly and works great together Im pretty hard on things so the fact that its water resistant is just the icing on the cake I love this phone due to its easy to use features While I probably dont use all the features the phone has to offer I am able to use the apps and features that I do need easily and expertly As I use my phone ALL the time for work I find that the keyboard and messaging capabilities are really nice and simple The ease of use and accessible features make this a great phone to possess The camera produces sharp crisp images even if using it in the dark Phone calls are easily understood with no muffling of sounds The battery is quite long lasting As if thats not good enough the phone will help to preserve the battery when its getting low This user is most definately enjoying her new phone I love my S7 Wouldnt change it for anything The phone is perfect I had iphone for 5 years and i decided to change to the galaxy 7 edge This is the best phone that i ever had I went from a Galaxy S3 to a S7 so it was quite a change for me So far I love it Easy to maneuver around the screens Fast processor Takes great pictures Its a good phone mine is a bit buggy right now I think its the updates and things but other then that it works great the new features on it fun and enjoyable not only that u can poor water on it and it still works I have used the galaxy phone for quite some time I love the S7 1 No access to the battery
2 Holding the sides of the phone most of times you open or close programs if the finger touched the screen
3 Too expensive for a phone that the battery can go bad I unfortunately got a dud the first one but the second phone i received has been amazing It is a great phone very easy to use The camera is very clear and takes great pictures Better than my tablet Its great all around I love it it is easy to use and figuring out how to use each figure its so easy to figure out it tells you what everything is and how to do it I now enjoy the ease of using the Samsung pay and uniqueness security feature The sync with my sound system and ph in my vehicle Great Ease of apps from Samsung galaxy App Store design for my S7 We bought 2 and simplicity of it all Ive had every Samsung galaxy since the first original galaxy My Samsung Galaxy 7 is by far the best the best thing that I have noticed so far is the quality of the camerapics Battery has incredible longevity compared to my old S4 Easy to use Great display and very fast This is by far the best phone I have owned I love everything about theS7 edge Too many great features to list Keep up the good work Samsung I really miss the stylist and a second screen for the edge portion on the note edge 4  other than that i love the lighted smaller fits in my front pocket drink holder in the my cars camera sharpness 

Bottom line when if they come out with a note 7 edge like the note 4 edge i will trade it in Loving my s7 So fast and reliable Great that I can add a memory card and the water resistance Overall great phone Everyone should have one Go get it now Nice to use I like the screen brightness and how it fits in my hand I love the fact its water resistant just as easy to use as my 5 it charges fast I just love my phone I would recommend it to everyone The samsung galaxy s7 is the best phone in the market thus far and is going to be for a while Ive had every type of phone and this is my favorite phone I love this phone its curves features and true colors display I believe that this phone is the best thing out Nice and slim Its so much better than the iPhone I would recommend this to anyone Love my new Galaxy S7 Super fast Pictures and videos 4k are amazing The feature to have expandable memory through a sd card is an A
Thanks again Samsung Almost flawless Great screen Only complaint is that the power switch is too sensitive and I sometimes hit it by mistake Small price to pay Three times in a month the sim card has become dislodged The first time I took in because I didnt know what was wrong After seeing the process Ive been able to do myself Very irritating and time consuming I never thought that I could be able to use Microsoft Word  Microsoft Excel with a phone What a joy to carry the materials with you that you need Samsung really hit it out of the park with the Galaxy S7 Bringing back expandable storage was why I waited until the next phone after the S6 Great phone for everyone Nice phone fits my hand and is easy to use

Some times I hit the volume key or power key by mistake I preordered the galaxy s7 and although its been buggy like any brand new phone i love it I have been getting galaxy phones since the 3 and i dont plan on changing Thanks for bringing back the sd card slot and keep up the great work This is the best galaxy so far Camera features are amazing Memory storage is great Battery lasts It doesnt over heat I really like this phone coming from an iPhone this is a huge improvement and the camera on here is very good Fast and big but not too big and it is slim and light cant tell when I have it in my pocket I GOT A S7 EDGE AND IS GREAT BETTER FEATURE SAMSUNG HAVE A QUALITY PRODUCT excellent design love the waterproof function the android system is not bad however I found google service is actually pretty good the cameras are great the front camera is much better than iPhone anyway I wont regret that I bought this Samsung s7 edge I love this phone only wish it was easier to transfer everything from another android though A little pricey and back should be aluminum But other than that Im in love so far  they are a lot better when they have big screens Virtually everything we do with smartphones is enhanced by a larger display messaging playing games watching video reading articles browsing the web you name it After all when its stripped down to its core the modern smartphone is little more than a touchscreen display in front of an ultracompact connected supercomputer A real stepup from my s5 The camera is great especially in low light I love the gold on this phone its very classy style phone and definently best phone i have ever owned i love showing it off to my friends and letting them feel how nice it feels and how fast it works 

awesome phone I like the look and feel of this phone It is a better size than my Note 5 Egde Awesome pictures and video Moves fast and doesnt hang up Just wish the edge screen had icons like the Note 5 I wish the headphones jack is on the top 
It should have usb c My wife and I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 and are very happy with the phones Battery life lasts all day with the 3000mah battery even with all the texting phone calls emails and social media checking we do all daylove the bright and sharp color of the s7 and am glad Samsung kept the gorilla glass for the s7 cause I dont want to worry about a cracked screen A big plus that the s7 is thinner than the s5 as i carry it in my pocket most of the day I wasnt a huge fan of the smooth back of the phone but with the case we have it doesnt matteralso wish they had left the headphones jack at the top of the phone as the s7 port is at the bottom by the charging portThe pros of this phone are way more than the few cons and I would very much recommend this phone Moved to this from an s5 and have never been happier This model is a little slimmer so fits in the pocket better Love the galaxy line I have had this phone for 2 weeks and i love everything about it I am a very heavy phone user spending usually more than 4 combined hours a day playing games or using the internet It can handle everything i put it up to It is even faster than my computer a Lenovo Yoga with an Intel Core i5 processor The only down side that i have found was that the onoff button locks up and does not work I have read that this is most likely a software problem because holding the volume down button and the power it shuts it off and it will work again Either way they are replacing it with out much arguing Best phone ever Fast great display Water proof Great battery I find that the back of my phone scratches rather Easley and the performance although fast is sketchy I would expect to not find shortcuts such as these on a phone this expensive As well as that it would be nice to have not seen the do not dispose etched on the back Good
Large beautiful curved display screen The edge pulls everything you are viewing in deeper for an overall awesome experience 
Navigation through the screens is seamless and easy to get to what you want quickly
It has a great range of brightness taking it from super dim to bright enough to see in direct sunlight
They brought back the SD Slot
One of the best camera apps Ive used 
Finger Print Scanner is amazing 
Waterproof
Wireless Charging

Price This phone is a bit pricey however it really packs the punches and raised the bar in the Android Market Its well worth the cost for what this device has to offer

I would have liked to have a battery that lasts longer than this one does For basic functionality I think its great I m glad that it has a fast charge option since I push my phone to the limit all day has everything Waterproof SD card powerful hardware beautiful screen all connectivity This phone is amaizingfastbeatiful desingncamera is good and fast This phone is amazing the screen is the most stunning I have ever seen on a phone and the camera delivers crystal clear photos that are on par with even some professional cameras The S7 edge is full of features and although some might not be for you you can turn them off in the settings My only complaint is that the fingerprint scanner could be better though it seems to work just as well as other flagship devices This phone is fantastic I love the always on display but I wish that there were options in terms of the looks I feel like it is pretty limited in that Also one problem I have had is with the wireless charging It is very temperamental and works less than half the time Sometimes I will put it on the charger and it will start loosing battery
 That gets frustrating but it is really the only problem I have had with this phone so far It runs very quickly does all of the phone things well and has good battery life I had the galaxy s6 before and I have to say that the 7 so much more awesomer I dont even think thats a word but it should be The battery life the always on display the super camera and the waterproofness makes this phone a must buy I show it off to my friends all the time which my friends have iPhones I have been a Samsung user for a few years now and this phone is by far the best one yet I have been very satisfied with my new phone Just wish it was easier to clean up contacts The pictures are really great Took some in a Vegas show and they were beautiful I switch from an iPhone 6s Plus And at first I was worried that I wouldnt understand how to use the phone but I was able to quickly figure it out and find it a very functional and fun to use device Good job Samsung best phone on the market This phone has everything you need from the design to the features I would definitely recommend this phone to someone lots of features nice feel very nice camera and screenwhats not to like I owned one iPhone I hated it I love my s7 edge Wouldnt go back to iPhone ever Ive had s4 s2 now the s7 edge Love all the features on galaxy phones Ive used s7 edge so far have exceeded my expectations Hope to own the next galaxy that comes out I want to own a tab someday Love the panoramic features awesome graphics best phone Ive owned so far Video feature is awesome I Im a longtime iPhone user who tried the Galaxy S4 and it broke the first time I dropped it due to its subpar screen and cheap plastic back I went back the iPhone after that However I recently was due for an upgrade and bought the Galaxy S7 the day it was released and its everything an iPhone should be Expandable memory water resistant sturdy glass on the front and back a ridiculously good camera and best of all the freedom the Android operating system provides Its incredibly fast has great video quality and its built to last

The only con I have about this phone is the struggle for all phones really it gets REALLY hot when you use it while charging Not enough to physically hurt you but it seems it could potentially hurt the components inside as 99 of users will use their phone while charging takes place

Way to go Samsung Youve finally made a phone that in my opinion is better than the iPhone i love this Phone have everithing i want and its beautifull I love my new phone its faster than the 6 and I like the edge design I love my s7 edge better then my iPhone 6 Plus I would recommend to try the phone Overall I like the S7 as a big fan of Samsung I was excited to receive this I think the battery life does not match the expectation set in the specs unless I turn off all the bells and whistles I like about the phone I have had every Galaxy since the galaxy s It is the best one yet So far I have been pretty impressed so far The phone is snappy and quick to respond display is fantastic So far I havent found any issues I use my phone a LOT throughout my day and have had no problems with the battery going dead Only towards the end of my 12 hour day does it finally get down to about 20 And the quick charging rate takes care of that issue I dont have a lot of programs or games so the 32GB memory works just fine for me This phones improved system helps for it to run smooth Im a big Samsung fan and a prior S5 user I was not impressed that with the S6 the expandable memory and the waterproof features were removed I felt that this was a step backwards With the S7 and S7Edge these features returned as well as more The phone is awesome My only wish is that it will continue to get thinner I absolutely love everything about this phone no matter what task the phone has to do it does it fast like charging and downloading apps the camera on both sides is magnificent  you can better customize your home screen to fit your needs and sooomuch more This is defiantly the best phone I have ever had I upgraded to this from an S4 and tberes definately a huge difference Its alot faster the display is sharper and much brighter for use is direct sunlight and the camera is excellent My biggest complaint is that the edges of the display are slightly curved just not as curved as the s7 edge This makes screen protectors not fit it well and there ends up being a gap between the screen and the screen protector on the edges The allows dirt to get in and makes it impossible to press buttons on the edge of the screen Still finding features the corner screen is nice  The edge is handy My time to get up is on itthanks the edge features icons peoplequick and easy 
I love this phone I was a blackberry guy from 2006 until 2014 when i got my s5 i loved my s5 never had any issues now i have moved to the s7 and im really happy with it isnt mindblowingly different from my s5 but that is a good thing for me The battery life is 5 times better i work 12 hr days 6 days a week and my s5 had to be charger on my lunch break every day at 45 my s7 is at 52 when i get home now same amount of use through the day Love this phone not hard to learn how to use or download and install applications Have not experienced the short battery life everyone had been talking about in the reviews the phone charges up fast when I do need to charge it Great phone with many features The camera works better than my digital camera The sound on videos and phone features is clear with a beautiful display The phone charges quickly Camera is awesome I would defiently recommend this S7 to my friends  family Phone is OK battery dose not lastand phone service is terrible realy hard to make callsnot worth the money its all hype I ordered this through Verizon Wireless and received it on the 16th of March I ordered the black Onyx
After 2 weeks with the product I can say I love it 
I upgraded from a Galaxy S4

The design is amazing along with the screen I love taking pictures with it 
Every image is just amazing The edge features are pretty nifty I specially like the always on display 
The night clock is also a great feature 
I bought the S7 because of the SD Card memory slot I did not want to be stuck with only 32GB of memory and have no expansion capabilities
Ive already dipped it in water and it has been working with no problem 


Now here are some of the cons 
The speaker can be blocked so easily the quality is kind of low for what is considered a premium handset 
If you put your finger on the bottom of the speaker it will block out all sound 
Removable battery none I loved having the option of being able to switch my batteries I always carried an extra one
The headphone jack at the bottom can cause issues if you put it in your pocket with the headphones plugged in 

The phone is great and it feels great It runs smooth as it should for a new phone 
Samsung phones do tend to get laggy and slow down after sometime though So lets see if this one is any different im really looking foward to the next galaxy but as of right now the edge is my new favorite im really glad they make the heavy duty case for it amazing phone def making sure my family each has one I like my 7edge I finally was able to use Samsung pay and its awesome no fooling with my wallet and getting my card out I like the features on curve edge I also have 6edge and it works good too I have most samsung products I guess you can say I am a Samsung girl I love this phone and there are lots of dramatic improvements over previous Galaxy series phones 

However I have one issue with the phone It cannot find my Bluetooth headsets I have 3 Bluetooth headsets and my Galaxy S4 could see them all instantly I am so disappointed I love everything about the phone except for this and I use my headsets daily I am hoping that a system update will address this issue and SOON I want my headphonespodcasts back while I exercise

Overall fantastic phone I can be sitting at my desk and the driving mode activates Not a great way to communicate with my clients this needs to be figured out Words cant explain how much I use my phone throughout the day and why its important for my phone to last as well Many of the phones I had in the past wouldnt last me six hours at most and it irritated me to charge my phone while working or at school I carried a battery pack everywhere I went just to insure my battery wouldnt die Now with the Samsung S7 Im able to comfortably use my phone throughout the whole day without having to worry about my battery dying Were talking twelve hours with an average use The fast charging is also much better than the previous Samsung phones I remember leaving my phone to charge at 6 and after twenty minutes my battery was around 45 No more having to leave my phone on the charger overnight I can wake up charge my phone while I get dressed and leave with a full battery to last me all day 

Another thing I want to say is that I love the idea of having a water resistant phone I seriously cannot stress about it enough How many times have I accidentally dropped my phone in water and have ruined it Many times I dont have to worry about that and Im so glad I already took a bunch of underwater pictures for my friend and she was surprised and bought her an S7 too 

One last thing Im a huge gamer I stream on Twitch for a living I was completely shocked when Samsung announced game recording RECORDING and easier screen capturing with their own software integrated into the phone Not only can you record you can also add yourself into the game play by having the camera on you When I tested it out for the first time I knew that it was something I would use every time Im playing on my phone Lately Ive been obsessed over Vain Glory and Taichi Panda I usually record when Im doing pretty good and I upload it to Facebook from my phone for my friends and family to see

This phone will change the world with its features Samsung you actually listened to our demands and Im so happy with my phone I dont have to worry about upgrading in a year I think this is the perfect phone to last up to fiveten years I mean its water resistant for the thought This phone is everything one could ever want it need It is a masterpiece Except it has an Achilles Heel

The back of the phone seems to be made from regular everyday plain glass It fell off my lap in class and after having the phone for less than two weeks the back glass shattered like a window pane I cant imagine why the screen is gorilla glass but the back is regular glass

But but it anyway Best money youll ever spend The Samsung S7 is absolutely the best phone I have ever used The camera is incredible for both pictures and video I always use Samsung Galaxy phone before 
but Galaxy S 7 is the best phone  This phone has impressed me in every way I have owned every galaxy since the galaxy s2 the s3 and s5 were my favorites until now it has the beauty of the s6 edge the water resistant of the s5 and the performance of no other this phone dominates in every aspect to my friends iPhone the battery is outstanding Im talking a full day of work and Im at 75 percent without ever charging throughout the day Hellothis is a well designed phone Lightweight and easytouse The s7 is 10 better than my s5 I had I am really pleased with it It has great features very easy to use I would recommend this phone to everybody Love the camera too I hope Im one of the lucky winners you have a nice day thank you From the design to the seamless operation I am 100 satisfied with this phone Samsung has hit it out of the park with the Galaxy S7 If a feature is technically feasible I believe it should be available and thats what Samsung has done Water and dust resistant expandable memory increased battery life fast charging Im sold that Samsung gives its customers what it wants The standard features of this mobile phone perform perfectly The features that I consider non standard and was not expecting turned out to be a pleasant surprise one of these features is Quick connect with this feature I am able to connect to my Samsung HDTV and can view pictures that I have recently taken or past pictures from my cloud drive this is especially useful at family gatherings Another feature is the ability to capture the mobile screen with a wave of the hand I use this to copy web pages for later review ie store sales coupons The camera is great and I like the live video one issue with this is when connected to my HDTV with quick view the live video does not work I have used Samsung pay with success the only problem is convincing the store personnel that it will work with their older equipment I switched from a galaxy s5 alpha to the 7 and i love this phone The battery lasts much longer than before the camera is clear and produces great pictures it is fast and easy to use The only minor detail is that when I have the phone on speaker for calls it is not very loud and I often have to use the extra volume button so that I can be handsfree The phone works just as advertised I would highly recommend it I have only had it since release and what I have gone through so far has been great I absolutely love this phone From its design to all the features that it offers this phone is more than I expexted I had gotten to a point where I didnt really use my phone as much except to make calls But now with the new features of this phone along with the added memory I do everything on this phone create and edit docs with Word Excel etc I didnt want a Note because it was too big for me so this phone is also the perfect size The boldness in the color and clarity of the screen is great as well This is just a great phone I like Samsung products but the battery dies rather quickly and the screen is a little small for me Other than that I am very satisfied with the new S7 I am really enjoying this phone so far Camra is amazing  I upgraded from the Samsung Core Prime The processor on this phone is great I LOVE the extra Samsung features such as Samsung Milk Music and the Kids app That is worth cost of the phone alone The reason why I did not give this a 5 is the battery life I always use Power Saving mode and I feel as though the battery does not last as long as it should This phone is built solid and has a great look Its easy to use and has a lot of great options and a very nice camera I upgraded from the Galaxy s5 and am very happy with this I absolutely love the camera Im a photography student so having a tool like this all the time is great The quick launch for the camera is really helpful and focusing is fast The design of the phone is very nice and easy to hold Well Ive had this phone for nearly a month now I absolutely love it Great screen great size and great features I only gave 3 stars because I believe the cost is a little high but really that relative Camera is very nice but I wish they would have went with a higher megapixel camera I am super happy they went back to the upgradable memory Upgraded from S5 Love the Galaxy phones This is my second S7 in 2 weeks because the iHeartRadio app within minutes causes the whole phone to reboot This wouldnt be too bothersome if also within days the WiFi and hardware buttons didnt also stop working Only factory reset fixes it 2 phones separate phones same problem I love Samsung I bought 4 of them 3 Samsung S7 and 1 S6 edge plus Ive been using the Samsung S7 Edge for about two weeksit is leaps ahead of any other phone Ive ever used the screen resolution is the best Ive ever seen The camera is awesome Handling the phone took some time to get used tomy hand was touching the edge making the edge feature active Ive adjusted my hand and isnt an issue anymore

The phone looks very sexy and the finish is smooth and feels great

Great job on this model Samsumg

Thanks After recieving my phone it was smooth sailing and I am in love I have always been and will always be a fan for samsung and the galaxy family The style of this phone is unique and 1 of a kind The features like the edge feature make my experiences always quick and satisfying My first charge after my phone died it charged for 3 hours and was only 47 finished My phone and charger was burning up Every charge after took about 2 hours and was only 75 full My battery life didnt last me a day and finally when I charged it 100 5th chargemy screen wouldnt turn on I knew It had power cause my blue light would flash and my task and back button lit up it even vibrated when people text or called me Even so my screen didnt work at all I really like Samsung but this little bug left me phoneless until my battery diedfunny how it lasted 3 days instead of 1 day this time I just charged it again and it seems to work fine now I just hope when I turn my screen off it will turn back on this time The camera is very amazing I LOVE the features I would definitely recommend this phone to all my friends Ive already gotten my best friend to buy the same exact phone I love my Gear VR goggles as well they are so amazing There is a reason Samsungs S7  S7 Edge Rate 1 These phones are amazing This phone is unbelievable One of the best phones I have ever had Im compelety in love and cant wait to see how they top this phone This is by far the best phone that I have ever had Not only does it satisfy all my needs it has introduced many features that I have not known before The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone I bought this phone for my husband The bright colors on the screens allows him to see things easier with his older eyes that have become more dim over time He can see the different apps and also numbers to dial without having to put his glasses on each time He is not very tech savvy and neither am I but the phone is easy for him to use I always take blurry pictures coz I manage to move just enough to mess it up With the camera in this phone my pictures have all been clear Im so excited to use it on my upcoming vacation We compared our old phone taking a picture in a dim room with the S7 and there was no comparison The old phone just showed a black screen while the S7 clearly showed everything in the room Like the title says there is nothing greater that I have owned The always on display makes notification checking a thing of the past Also the camera is impeccable Amazing pictures and the photo motion makes capturing great moments even easier And also the best feature is the edge screen I can contact friends easier hot key apps ans check sports teams with Yahoo sports app Love the water resistance too The best Samsung smartphone yet Great performance The best camera on any phone with beautiful screen All around excellent value I needed to get a new phone only because my Casio phone would not hold battery charge I heard a lot of good things about the Samsung brand which was another reason I waited for the S7 So I went into the store and purchased the phone
I noticed the second day that in was difficult for other to hear me and the wifi connection was poor I took it back to the store within the 14 days and the tech had to do so things to my phone while explaining why the manufacturer had certain features
A couple of days later I noticed my phone had a software update for all the issues I was having which means I was not the only consumer But then the same day my phone just shut down and restarted then it froze and I had to shut it down
Its a pretty phone but I do not think this phone software is all that This phone is a high quality product It has expandable memory The only draw back is you cant change out the battery But everything else is perfect about this phone Great pictures Calls are clear There isnt much exciting about it except that its waterproof Other than that its decent I thought the battery life would be better It is a very good phone Its my 3rd galaxy s phone Ive gone from a Galaxy S2 to a Note 3 to this and Samsungs design gets more elegant each generation The S7 Edge doesnt give up much in the way of screen size compared to my old Note but its much slimmer and easier to hold Battery life has been very good so far but I worry about 1218 months from now since it isnt replaceable The camera is fast and takes gorgeous pics the speaker is much improved from the Note 3 and call quality has been excellent And as expected from Samsung the screen is ridiculous Its early but so far this is a solid 9 out of 10 only losing a point for the nonreplaceable battery I love the phone its features and how easy it is to use Upgrading from a previous Galaxy model the S7 definitely show vast improvements over software accessibility and sizeweight Im however a little disappointed that the battery life doesnt live up to the hype or advertisement It will last me all day as long as apps are shut down and theres minimal hidden applications running in the background but Ive noticed that some days the battery doesnt last as long as expected even when Im not using the phone much Then again some days the battery life is amazing This phone gets pretty hot just watching videos sometimes and lags while unlocking the phone I just cant say enough about this phone This is my first Galaxy S series phone I moved up from a Note 4 This is much smother and faster I never have problems doing multiple things at once which is hard to believe of a phone 

I am really enjoying the camera too I loved the camera on the note but this one is even better The only real improvement for me would be to get my larger screen back

Very nice having the SD card slot back as well Had a Galaxy S6 Edge and upgraded to this one Comparing the two the S7 Edge trumps in every aspect which it should Screen is still very clear and responsive The edge feature is much more functional this time and easy to use Only con i have so far is getting fingerprint smudges on the screen however a screen protector can fix that Overall this is the best phone ive ever owned Just got the Galaxy S7 Edge and its an awesome 
improvement from the S6 I owned previously The S7 brought back the Micro SD card and is waterproof too The phone has a sleek design and has alot of functionality which makes it not only practical but easy to use too Definitely a great value compared to other phones This phone is sturdy Great battery life and possessing speed It does freeze up every once in a while for no apparent reason which is why the four stars The galaxy s7 edge is an amazing phone I came from a iPhone 5s and the s7 makes is seem like a old flip phone I absolutely love the camera its so clear and captures every detail All the modes on the camera are awesome especially the slow motion The screen is so smooth and sleek my finger just glides across the screen with ease Overall I give the phone 1010 Thank you Samsung for bringing this phone into the world Oh yeah I almost forgot about the oculus vr goggles A mind blowing experience I really like this phone a lot better than any other phone Ive had My last phone the htc one m8 did have one thing better which was the front facing speakers Its not a major issue more of a preference The speaker on the bottom is just too easily covered on accident and not quite loud enough This phone is hands down the best electronic device Ive ever owned I would recommend it to literally everyone loving the s7 sleek design fast processor loving the scam or debit collector notice upon calls love the split screen option such an amazing phone The screen is amazing It takes pictures with very little pause and the are so clear Very unique phone waterproof longer life battery plus it is 55in screen Excellent phone would recommend to others its great qaulity no cons about phone I wasnt sure about making the switch to Samsung because I was really happy with my previous LG phone When both flagship phones were announced the Samsung Galaxy S7 won me over I have been recommending this phone to family and friends I love how the phone feels in my hand not to heavy or to thin Holding the phone without a case is comfortable in my hand The performance is fast and liquid and amazing quality The compatibility with the Samsung VR is wonderful and we have even shared it with strangers in a waiting room I have experienced some bug issues but I feel that is to be expected with brand new phones with the latest operating system as some of my apps may not be communicating well yet The wireless charging is wonderful The phone does seem to get rather warm during charging and when using the Samsung VR Overall I am extremely happy with this new phone and glad I made the switch from LG I have a feeling more Samsung products and phones will be in my future I love love love the new phone love all the features and quick setup and love love the fact its waterproof and dont have to worry Ive used the Samsung phones for years Had a Samsung for a while the s7 is better finger print scanner actually works should have gotten an edge though because its to small for my hands I picked up the new Galaxy S7 a few weeks ago I love this device It is a lot like my S6 but with some nice upgrades The new camera is outstanding This phone is better than I thought like it very well I love the new s7 however there are things that take away from the complete experience with the phone The battery though upgraded from the s6 I thought didnt last noticeably longer I use my phone way more than average Some apps perform poorly but will probably be worked out sooner rather than later Overall happy with the phone Wish they would have kept the s6 camera I thought it was better Feels good Looks great Fast Beam Me Up Scotty I love this phone Everything about it great camera  style edge size This is the best phone Ive ever owned so far I especially enjoy using my gear VR with it and I look forward be using the gear 360 with it when it becomes available The screen quality is excellent The speed is also very good The water resistance comes in very handy Great phone Luv the pics  camera Not to happy that the phone doesnt have the music and video default players anymore Thats the only bad thing I have had this for for about a week Still trying to figure out all of its capabilites It does have a great camera I love the Samsung pay My only issue is to me it seems like the battery runs down quickly I exchanged it for a different phone thinking it may be a defect but the new one seems to be the same Yes I would like to let the world know that this phone has a lot of great features also it has a protective shield so that your phone wont get damaged and there are many features Thank you Samsung I love everything about my phone love the new processor and the speed of the phone And the design of it is flawlessSamsung has done a wonderful job with all the features the camera and the battery is amazingoverall I love this phone and everything about it I had a galaxy s4 active and was due for a new phone I went and bought the new s7 What a nice phone great design water resistant and great camera I use it everyday for multiple things and is like a my second laptop I have a neo smart watch that goes right along with it Great products keep it up samsung I upgraded from the S5 Im really enjoying the long battery life and responsiveness of the OS I love that I can easily block app notifications and set custom permissions for apps Love Wireless charging Bluetooth audio performance is great My S5 lacked there but the S7 is working great so far Ive been ano Android user since the Motorola Droid and a Samsung phone user since the Galaxy S3 I upgraded to the S4 as soon as it came out and used it until the S7 was released
Pros lightweight and waterresistant without relying on flappy covers like the S5 expandable storage up to 200GB microSD 12MP main camera with fast launch and superb picture quality even in low light etc
Cons glass back makes for an overlyfragile feeling device requiring use of a case which covers the premium back use of glass back means battery is not swappable though fash charge makes this less of a dealbreaker depending on use requirements

Overall a very nice device building on lessons learned from previous devices Samsung seems to have listened to demands to bring back removable storage now we all need to demand a move away from the glass back Highly recommend if youre looking to replace an aging S5 or earlier Upgrading to the S7 from the S6 will not be much of a performance boost but will add waterresistance and expandable storage and an even better camera

Wish list metal or even plastic back frontfacing stereo speakers and eventually 4K display to eliminate or at least drastically reduce screendoor effect with Gear VR I dont upgrade and get new devices often but I decided I wanted to take the chance to get and do something new This is my first time buying a device that hasnt been released yet but I really liked the display and features of the Galaxy S7edge when I seen it at ATT After playing with the display for a bit at ATT and my old phone having a number of issues going on I knew I was going to upgrade but I wasnt expecting to upgrade to a device that wasnt even outreleased yet Im extremely happy with my new Galaxy S7edge and Im glad I found the patience to wait for the shipping issues I even got a Samsung Gear S2 at the same time that I ordered the Galaxy S7edge and I wasnt even aware of the Gear S2 but when I seen it I had to have one of them too I love this phone it does everything I want a phone to do The one part I like the most is the Samsung pay app The only problem I have is when hooked up to smart watch and BT the phone dies kinda fast But we do have the rapid charge on this phone 

Thanks Samsung for bringing back the SD card The phone is very fast looks great easy to use amazing camera This phone was very disappointing to me
I love the Samsung phones but this one not so much the size is small and not too different than the others And not much difference in performance for the price This phone nothing less than amazing it has great processing capability and is reliable Screen never cracks It really is dust and water resistant I love this phone The samsung galaxy s7 has been amazing From the beautiful display to the low light camera this phone is the perfect combination of power with beauty The expandable storage gives you the ability to download the 3000 hours of books on tape that youve always wanted while also giving you the capability to store all 5000 photos of your dog in different hats 

Overall great phone This is an overall great phone but has two flaws It keepa disconnecting my bluetooth in my car and when i use the speaker on regular handset no one can hear me Other than that i love this phone I have been a diehard Mac fan for years However when I heard about the Galaxy S7 Edge I had to take a second look While there is a bit of a learning curve to switch from an iOS platform to an Android platform the switch is so far well worth it I am impressed by the graphics user interface intuitive design and overall feel of the phone I immediately purchased a MicroSD card to boost my memory to 128gb  something I could not do with any iPhone So yes I am a satisfied customer As much as I would like to say how many great things are going on with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Ive yet to be fully satisfied with what Im seeing and experiencing One reason is because the phone constantly overheats when charging on fast charge settings via cord and Wireless or removed fast charging settings Even when you optimize the battery to ensure some apps arent constantly running when not in use it still manages to overheat The processing speed is nothing to brag about considering my wifes Note 5 performs better than the S7 The phone is small which does make it convenient for pocket placement comma however its small size is also a problem to those with bigger hands Forcing the need to buy the Note 5 or S7 Edge The phone is grossly overpriced and the reason is mostly for its Fitness utilities The Health utilities are very useful in keeping track ones own wellbeing Its accuracy to location when using Google Maps and S Health is excellent The fingerprint reader was a very nice touch However it could use some improvement on actual finger placement or even a full scan of ones finger comma reason being is when using this security feature the phone tends to not recognize the finger that has been stored in its memory and then locks the person out for 30 seconds before trying again Should also include a feature to take a picture of the person trying to unlock the phone when an attempt has failed This phone is the best smartphone Ive even seen Not to bash the iPhone but the iPhone sure does have some catching up to do Amazingamazingamazingsuper fast screen quality super vivid colors high resolution the edge has been improved and now offers a lot of functionality the design is beautiful we dont expect less from Samsung The expansion slot bring more space for your 4K videos New features added to the camera like video collage The camera take amazing pictures including low light enviroments This is an amazing phone that now perform even better with the latest version of android Little bit disappointed that the infrared feature was removed but still happy I like it but I have a hard time sending and receiving calls from home Love the new S7 Im very active and enjoy the water proof feature The expandable memory allows me to have all my photos music and books at my fingertips 4 Words to describe the galaxy s7 edge Best Galaxy Phone Ever Hi I just got the s7 edge and trust me guys its awesome The design is awesome its feels good in hand with the new design It also has awesome features too I love my new S7Only problem I had was until I figured out how to sync my new phone with my old samsung tabletI use the calender on both but after speaking with my provider they walked me through itI just need to upload the old calender on new phone I ALSO love the camera I have already shut off a lot of the features I didnt like the phone doing whatever it wanted just because you picked it up wrong or touched the wrong area of the phone Although the phone may still be fairly new and of course there are kinks here and there which will eventually be fixed This is an awesome phone Its sleek slim lighter in my opinion works faster and has better features Only thing I dont like tho is when my screen turns on occasionally like it lights up even when I disabled the always on display feature Overall thumbs up Looking forward to when all the kinks are worked out and when I can use a remote app I am always taking pictures of my kids and they have turned out supper It is good to have a phone that has the micro sd card slot again the screen is vibrant and battery life is superb The fast charging through wall charge and Qi charger is a bonus when in a rush the phone can be topped off on the run 

Takes a Little getting used to the app menu and buttons that are placed differently that the droid Turbo I am Used to I am sure that in time it will become second nature The swipe screen when connected to a trusted device is a little annoying to get to a text message or email The always on screen could benefit with more notifications rather than just missed calls and email messages Adding in text messages and hangout messages would be appreciated The edge screen can be accidentally activated and can cause viewing youtube videos challenging if accidentally touched Finally screen is a little Laggy Overall very good device and fingerprint scanner is a definite bonus The Samsung Galaxy s 7 edge takes great pictures and have high speed processing I love the phone but I had hoped for an unlocked bootloader to continue updating after the phone is no longer supported It doesnt heat up the battery last me about two days sometimes more depending how much I use it And it charges fast in about 1hour to 1hour and 30 minutes And yes it is waterproof I use it daily in my job and I work outdoors and even when im soaked I dont have to worry about my phone getting wet and updates are fast My third Galaxy They just keep getting better
Im a huge Samsung fan and own several products
All quality products with great design and performance
Love Samsung The camera upgrades are amazing and the battery has improved so much Overall I love this phone Fast easy to use and great picture quality You cant hold the S7 Edge like a normal 55 inch screen because you will surely get your screen screwedup once your fingers touch the edges of the screen Typing on the keyboard gives you wrong entries and sometimes you have to pressed it hard just to type the correct letters especially when using the letters on the edges Edge panels dont update needs improvements so I prefer to use FlowHome App instead Samsung Pay does not work on most stores with limited Credit DebitCards so I disabled it too Everything is great Ive spent so much on cases and tempered glass to try to find something to fit and I still havent very stressful Great phone love the new features especially being waterproofI dont really like the feel of it without a case but thats about all I can find wrong with it Best phone rberTralee good pictures never go back to anything else I have always had a Samsung phone I never had the best of the best until now I was always a model or two behind That has all changed I have never and I mean never had a phone preform quite like the New Galaxy S7 With Samsung innovation and history of Cell phones I know I will be back again when I upgrade The sleek design of the S7 feels good to hold The functions of this phone will blow your mind To much to describe here Keep up the good work Samsung I will always be a faithful customer Love the phone other than the wifi really drags when your using Blue tooth and a few other apps Apparently samsung knows about this issue and is working on it Other than that the phone is very nice I read all the reviews before deciding on buying this phone and am not disappointed I love how the phone feells while holding it I love all the features and the color of the screen There is a lot I do not do with a phone but I am certainly glad I have one of these The last Samsung handset I had was the Galaxy S3 It was a great handset and I have fond memories of it The Galaxy S7 is such an incredible leap forward its like night and day 

I love how it feels in your hand It fits comfortably yet never feels like its going to slip out of my hand 

I love the speed and the features The fingerprint sensor is awesome The camera is really solid and packed with features 

The only negative is battery life when using all the bells and whistles could be better 

Otherwise this is by far the best handset Ive ever had No glitches in this phone Looks like all of the big screen is good I love that the edge features are working great This phone is great Its beautiful fast and the edges are so cool I was really unsure if I wanted this phone or the regular s7 at first but once I got it is was so happy with it Frees internetbased problems cant connect took it in to attend store and said its okay same problem with my daughter but much more often than minr Sometimes the power button just stops working Clearly this is a software issue because you can use it and the volume down button to restart the phone 

Otherwise great features excellent camera perfect phone currently I love the edge feature Slide over put your favorite apps task news weather etc So many options It makes or fast to unlock your phone and open the app you want to right away Its a great phone I love it very much Im glad I got it Great battery life excellent performance and perfect size Much easier to type one handed than the Note I love this new phone It responds very quickly and the resolution is the screen is impeccable As usual Samsung hits it againIve have every model of Galaxy and every time I upgrade I am thrilled with the improvements and enhancements with the next model Keep up the great work Samsung And thanks for going back to the removable memory This phone is everything they said it would bewith that being said one morning I woke up and the screen was not responding The buttons lit up and the alarm even went off but the screen remained black A simple reboot and were back in business This is by far the best phone I have ever come across The camera is quick and responsive Apps open quickly Definitely an upgrade from the S6 My only complaint is the removal of the TV remote feature This phone is superb the resolution is amazing The photos that it takes are awesome Would recommend the phone to everyone It has so many features that I still havent use I had the s4 and loved it Love this also Only thing I dont like is the favorites doesnt organize alphabetically or anything Its just random This is by far my favorite Samsung Galaxy yet Ive owned the S4 and the S5 and this one surpasses both The battery life is awesome I can go all day and then some on one charge The camera is far beyond what I expected has a selfie flash and I love the wide angle selfie option for groups This is my first experience with the edge screen I like the quick accessshortcuts that it can provide the only reason I gave the design 4 stars instead of 5 was because the edge screen felt so slippery in my hand that I was terrified I was going to drop it so I went back and purchased a case right away I am thrilled with this purchase and would recommend this phone to anyone who loves social media wants to take beautiful pictures or just loves a really cool device Ive owned several Samsung Galaxy phones in the past and this by far is the best one yet From the premium phone build itself to the updates on the TouchWiz UI One of the biggest updates that Ive enjoyed this year is the camera The picture quality is subperb and would compare it to any DSLR currently on the market Another thing I enjoy is the great battery life Im a power user and the battery on this phone will last the entire day Samsung has really outdone themselves with this one After 2 weeks of normal use of my s7 Ive noticed a couple issues that arent perfect but arent enough for me to dislike my new phone First the WiFi strength isnt great It works fine if Im in the same room as my router but as soon as I leave the room the speed and connectivity drop like Ive left the house completely Second the fingerprint scanner and health sensor can be difficult to operate under normal circumstances I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 I must say it was a good move The display is 10 xs better and in daylight theres no blur The camera is by far the best on the market and photo editing is supreme samsungforlife I have had my Samsung Galaxy S7 for a month now This is my 4th Samsung product and I dont see reason to change companies any time soon They have their customer in mind The phone is so easy to use straightforward and beautifully designed The gold although completely superficial is gorgeous I thoroughly enjoy being able to keep YouTube open and videos playing while running other apps like Messages or Maps The screen itself is a dream So smooth and responsive The picture quality is amazing And I love that the front facing camera is all the more clear now Having little ones that only take pictures if they can see themselves this comes in quite handy The fingerprint reader has improved since the Galaxy S5 so I dont get locked out or frustrated Overall I adore this phone I love Samsung and what they produce I love my phone I previously had the Galaxy S5 and although I loved my phone by the end the battery life was ruined and the phone froze a lot With the S7 the battery life is amazing The phone charges in less than 2 hours and the battery for me can last up to 17 hours 8 of which I am asleep for The phone is light the colors are beautiful and it does not freeze The durability is also great since I have issues with dropping my phone into water and on the floor and that has not been an issue with the phone I do have to say that the battery life is my favorite thing on this phone I up graded from an S3 to an S7 because I wanted the new features like Samsung Pay and S HEALTH
I also like the fact that it allows you to alphabetized your apps
The fingerprint security also works very good
I am an Amateur Radio Operator for over 20 years and really into the latest electronics devices
The Samsung S7 is one of those great devices
I highly recommend Samsung products to my friends and aquaitenses Im still learning all the new things but the one thing this model doesnt have that the s5 had was the TV remote app I used that a lot but the s7 doesnt seam to have it this mobile device has the looks and the skills
it basically has the features of a computer and more software is easy to use and user friendly 
i would recommend this product to everyone i was originally an iPhone girl but wanted to try something else and bought the galaxy i absolutely love everything about it and keep telling my friends they should upgrade to it too its slim sleek and water resistant also fast cant get any better then that I love this phone The camera is awesome I have a gold one and its gorgeous Some apps stop working sometimes which is the only downfall But after a couple minutes it works again Other than that best phone Ive ever had I purchased this phone as an upgrade to my current Samsung S5 The camera performance and features clearly outweigh the S5 but have been more amazing than I could have imagined The battery life can sometimes be lacking but the features often outweigh that small negative I mostly bought it for the camera to take pictures of my new baby and have fully used the motion pictures feature to capture the best image of her The ability to expand storage has been huge since I tend to take more than just one picture of my little girl And with its speed of accessing the camera or anything else I rarely miss the best moments Shuts off unexpectedly Could be in the middle of doing something or not and it has restarted Enjoying many of the new features such as the camera using more than one app at a time open easily move around in the phone overall enjoying the phone with each new use found The past 2 years I have used a Windows phone The galaxy s7 edge has surpassed that phone and any other phone I have used in many years Battery life and responsiveness are everything and this phone has it all Went to Nashville for the weekend and never had an issue with loosing battery life Awesome Lasted all day and all night The edge to edge screen is amazing asking with the clarity and resolution The camera takes photos that compare to a professional Being able to disable the bloatware is s great feature too One of the great product to have in my hand I messed around with iPhones 6s and compare both The winner is GS7 I love my Samsung Galaxy 7 It has awesome features Easy to use I can now do FaceTime with family and friends which is awesome I do basically everything on this phone for my business and pleasure I can use Word and Excel on here and able to download all my documents through I CLOUD I have only had Samsung Galaxy phones and the 7 is the best yet Thanks Samsung for making such a AWESOME phone best phone i have ever had Better then my Galaxy Note 3 which was my old fav Its the best at pretty much everything i threw at it so far Good job samsung

Also quality of build is great sound is stellar feeling is top notch I love the camera also how fast it is switching from app to app and overall performance is awesome I love the edge features because they make everyday tasks and notifications simple
I also really like the larger screen size and thin phone size
But the battery life is excellent We were ready for an upgrade and went to our store to look at some new smartphones and after spending quite a bit of time there we decided on the Samsung Galaxy S7 We did look at other phones and our previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S5 so we were familiar with the features but were so impressed with the look and features on the S7 that it was easy for us to choose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung did some great improvements on this phone like the water resistant feature and we added the glass cover for extra protection and a beautiful hard case for both of our phones Thank you for all the improvements on our new phones I have always loved the galaxys and this one is right on point Great look great features superb camera and editing features I loved it so much I couldnt help but talk about it with my coworkers and talked one of them who was looking to upgrade her phones for her and her family into switching from an iPhone to the Galaxy s7 edge and she loves it Great job Samsung keep up the good work

Sincerely
A loyal Samsung customer
Wendy This is a great phone and I have recommended it to several friends It works great and the waterproof feature is a big plus with how active I am in my daily life The only complaintsolution I have are the screen doesnt register my swipes every so often and the design makes the phone a fingerprint magnet making a case almost a necessity Other than that this is a wonderful phone and I will continue to recommend it to people This phone is great The camera clarity is immaculate the battery life is long the edge functionality works well and there is very minimal application startup time 5 stars Nice device I really love the new Samsung Galaxy S7 I am enjoying the new camera it has My pictures have come out amazing The size is perfect and fits in your palm or pocket I like that it displays the time date and battery percentage consistently when facing up The color options are also very nice The only thing I am not a fan of is that when removing the or adding a mini sd card you have to have a small device that came with the phone to do so Otherwise this phone is perfect Ive been a galaxy man since the S3 Every model had outlasted its 2 year contract but the next gen is always too enticing to pass up This phone is beautiful responsive and overall just fantastic The only gripe I have is that it is fragile and slippery An easy fix with a case I thought I would hate not having a removable battery but I have yet to need to do so Definitely going to stick with the galaxy line for years to come This is my ever review I think this phone is great and works in every way you would desire out of a phone The only change I would make was for it to have a IR for connecting to TVs I would have designed the screen after the S6 or S5 so that people could get tempered glass screens for the phone Great phone just lacks minor custom settings that prior Samsung phones bad like changing the color of the text message bubbles Love how the software operates with every app Havent had a problem with each task that I perform on my galaxy s7 I would highly recommend this phone to all my friends in a heartbeat Cant wait til Samsung makes the new software update on my phone better Thank you for making such an amazing phone for the people The minute I held this phone I fell in love The water resistant beautiful metal and glass design makes this the most comfortable and durable phone I have ever held I would recommend it to anyone especially people who do a lot of mobile phone photography This phone has a lot of great features the front and back camera are amazing However the home button is very easy to get scratch I like the edge features and Samsung pay The themes are pretty cool too This phone is a must have Much better than the iPhone You wont be disappointed I love my new phone I was worry about nor liking it but its a galaxy  There Non way u are not going to like it Always happy with galaxy phones and the s7 did not disappoint I am still learning my S7 but am loving the great HD like photos your camera takes the fact that it is waterproofkeeps the mind at ease It is fairly easy to navigate 

One of my biggest complaint so far is the SD Card notification keeps popping up This seems to be a familiar issue with many of the S7 Owners on different forums It is hard to determine why this keeps happening I have tried their suggestions on how to stop this annoying popup throughout the day but to no avail The product had a little trouble at the start but it was brand new but now everything is fine since the new update I was looking forward to upgrading to a Galaxy s7 after owning many Galaxy phones in the past To name a few Galaxy s3 Galaxy s3 mini Galaxy Note 3 etc 12 days after purchasing the phone I went to make a phone call to my mom When her voicemail picked up I pulled the phone from my ear and the screen didnt illuminate So I pressed the power button and the screen stayed black So I pressed the button on the bottom of the phone and this time the soft keys illuminated but not the screenit remained black I brought it to a Verizon store so they could confirm my belief and unfortunately they did The digitizer went bad I believe this was due to an overheating issue as the phone had been pretty hot with no use and no running apps Overheating is not the only issue I experienced Keyboard lag camera lag when zoomed in freezing and the unremovable battery I couldnt hang up my phone because I couldnt remove the battery My galaxy s7 edge in my opinion has improved from its previous version in looks and camera quality The phone has impressed me I loved my galaxy 5 but the plastic made it feel cheap but this version has made up for that in every way The camera impresses not only myself but my friends as well by out performing them in every picture I just change from an iPhone to the Samsung s7 so far I am loving it but I hope it last as long as my iPhone did 4 years I love my new Samsung phone Perfect size cool appeal beautiful display and nice little workhorse of a phone I love how fast the phone is and the definition is great I love the fingerprint technology and the camera is great too Years ago I started out with a popular phone that was not Android I was very happy with the operating systems stability but became bored and ready for a change When the new Galaxy 7 Edge came out I decided to take the plunge Wow what a difference There are several reasons I decided to do this but three of the biggest were 1 Up to 200GB expandable memory 2 Waterresistance and 3 Dualpixel technology for faster focusing and lowlight photography So far the Android operating system has been easy to adapt to and much more versatile 
Very impressive This phone is ultimately the best phone anywhere It is the easiest to use compared to other models I have had this for over 3 weeks now and have not found even one flaw I would recommend this to each and every person I know and any person I meet Im sure they would thank me after they had one for just a few days If you dont have one go get one Trust me Its worth every penny Battery life is excellent speed is terrific display is crystal clear Ive had it for a little over a week and really like it Its sleek and has really nice features and takes the most AMAZING pictures I have always used Samsung Galaxy phones from the first one to the s 7 they are the best phones too use I had a LG G2 since it first came out until my screen finally cracked after 2 years I decided I wanted to try a Samsung galaxy out and the promotion for the free Gear VR was also available This phone is absolutely amazing It is quick takes amazing photos and does everything I want it to and more I love it never seen phne do the things this phne does water proof I just love the camera I love the whole phne Ive always used Samsung but this one is d best one of the best phone on the marketit has all the features needed Great product Great features 
Camera is good quality
Media easily accessible This is my fourth Samsung phone Love everything about it I can see many changes and improvements that made this phone even better Never own other phone and dont want to I know now for sure that my next phone is going to be Samsung Great photos Affordable People can finally hear me when I call them Nice phone good sound quality charges fast and stays charged for a long time What else could you want in a phone I havent yet tested the water repellent feature and hope not to Best Smartphone ever made
great design
perfect size
wonderful camera
very durable
user friendly I love this phone I had the Galaxy S5 and traded up to this one and it is wonderful Its easy to use and I love the bigger screen This is by far the coolest phone Ive ever had The battery life is impressive even when constantly playing on the phone all day which is what Ive done since I brought it home I love the edge shortcuts and features and everything on this phone is customizable The camera takes gorgeous pictures and I love the expandable storage since I dont have a computer and keep all pictures on my device I have zero complaints with this phone Its super fast and the water resistant feature is a huge bonus I am impressed with this phones new options and extended battery life I am glad to see that Samsung brought back the option to add additonal SD card storage I havent had the phone long enough yet to know whether I like having to use a key to remove the SD card but it seems like a good idea not having to pull the back of the phone off to access the card anymore The increased megapixel camera and photo editing options are very good also Ive had the phone about a month now still loving it The battery is much improved over previous generations and the competition The new features are nearly all optional so you can only use battery for the ones you want Basically the only bad thing I can say is that there is no longer an option to disable the soft button backlights while using the phone I read at night on it and the lights come on when you touch the screen I really love the Samsung Pay app I use it all the time Also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory I have 128 MB and have never run short The camera takes great pictures even in low light and the video quality is unsurpassed
All in all I have yet to find anything negative to talk about This is as great as all of my Samsung products The display is great The phone is a little slippery so I got a case I am disappointed that this phone doesnt work as a TV remote like my S5 did The Camera has the option to record before the photo is snapped and allows you to capture any of the images leading up to the snapped photo Great option

The Finger Print Scanner is easy and a great option for unlocking the phone

With a packaged Flashlight app it saves having to have a third part app

When used with Samsung Gear VR the Galaxy S7 brings a great Virtual Reality experience to the user

The battery life is great

The screen is very clear and vibrant 

Samsung is the leader in cell phones I have been a big fan of all the Samsung Galaxy phones since my first purchase of the Galaxy S4 They get better and better every year and I will never go back to any other type of phone 
stuckonSamsung 4Life 

Elisa Exceeds my expectations Dont regret not getting Note 5 this fits the bill For those not interested in the edge feature this is the perfect phone Fast effiiecient beautiful screen and the best camera Added micro sd slot a welcomed back feature that increases value Treat yourself The Galaxy S7 is a combination of the best design and materials in any smartphone on the market today The internals are some of the best available from the processor to the camera the technical specs hold up to or flat out beat any available Android smartphone The design is simply stunning I love the premium materials Yes even the glass back It might be a little slippery but its a joy to hold I almost hate putting it in a case its that nice to look at Samsung has toned down TouchWiz and thats a great thing And even better if you install the Good Lock app from the Galaxy App store it gives the phone an even more stock Android feel The Galaxy S7 took the best ideas from the S5 and the S6 and combined them into one almost perfect phone The expandable memory and the IP67 waterproofing makes this the best phone to own right now I like fell and performance
It works preciselly and fast 
Very business friendly I am very pleased with my purchase I would never consider buying another brand of cell phone or tablet going forward Im not sure why but at one point my phone couldnt receive calls I restarted and it worked fine after that Also I have an issue with the volume of the ringer but I keep it on me all the time so its not a big deal

I love the S Health app Ive kept track of all kinds of things with it and it encourages me to keep moving throughout the day

I also love the speed and storage on this phone this thing is really fast 

The screen resolution is beautiful I havent taken a lot of pics with it yet so I really cant judge on the quality of the pictures 

The fast charging feature is wonderful It charges so fast so Im rarely down for long I like the return of a few key features in addition to an ergonomics update which is more than cosmetic

Micro SD for all the file hoarders out there 
Water Resistance because life happens
A larger battery than the S6 and its predecessor especially with the edge model Finger print security works better then any phone ive had and Samsung pay is super easy New Galaxy S7 Edge Does everything and moreSimply Awesome Great phone Runs great looks amazing lightweight beautiful screen and awesome performance Its a Galaxy so you know its gonna be great I have had several Samsung phones and tablets and I love them I have compared pics taken with GS7 to GS6iPhone and the pics quality consistently comes out better that other models especially the screen When I sent pics taken by GS7 to other phones to display the pic quality brightness and contrast is much better displayed by GS7 I switched from iphonelove this phone Super easy to use So far I cant say that I dont love my new Edge At first there was a problem with overheating but I assume that was from prolonged usage I then had some issues with some apps closing but that has gone away There are still a few kinks to work out but overall having and working with this phone has been a tremendous experience I love the performance and feel of this device It far outperforms my old samsung and I didnt think anything would do as well Very sharp looking phone right out of the box Lightweight doesnt look cheaply made like other brands 2 weeks later after purchasing my Galaxy S7 edge i still havent learned all there is to learn about my phone The S7 edge is by far the most advanced phone yet Compared to the original Galaxy Mega which is what i had before i upgraded night and day Honestly cant complain wasnt a real big fan of Samsung but Im glad I made the switch Phone has good features versatile well designed and comfortable Give yourself a pat in the back Samsung The edge works so smoothly and response time is awesome Beautiful design and great features The edge panels are amazing and makes usage super easy The Samsung Galaxy S7 is packed with wonderful features With Android 60 you cant go wrong But then again the camera is suffering a little but Pictures are not as crisp as you would expect coming from the note 5 I am highly disappointed The camera features are also a little more difficult for me to use coming from the note 5 

My next complaint would be the keyboard was having tons of trouble with the preset keyboard so I had to change it The settings would not fix the problem of it constantly changing my letters words and punctuation 

Overall I like the phone Its a nice size change since the note 5 was a little large for my small hands but I do miss my note 5 Ive had my phone for almost a month and its honestly exceeded my expectations The S7 EDGE is a well built and useful phone it has everything you need for a phone and more

Personally I love the phone because I switched from iPhone to Samsung because of the great things I always here about them and it really is a great device for any one kids to workers i love this product because it has expandable storage It is amazing i use it a lot for my photos files and of course my music i just love it Other than the expected teething pains from a new galaxy phone its perfect Luv the new s7great photos great multi window operationslove the new features This phone has it all From its amazing camera to its new game tools launcher Respectively the camera has proven to be the best one Ive seen yet on a phone and thats excluding the new features it possesses The motion capture helps grab a photo at the perfect moment allowing you to get the best quality youre looking for or just that timed shot that we so often miss by a fraction of a second The game launcher has been such a delight for me and other users Videos are being posted much more often with footage of hearthstone and other multiplayer games that get a lot of attention The video and voice commentary is the best addition giving viewers a much more connected feel 
This is what our phones are about right Giving everyone the opportunity to connect with the world around them Frequency reliability and qualitythe new Samsung S7 and S7 Edge have proven to be the best kind of connecting experience for any and all users Whither youre a beginner or adept tech user the edge offers functions that give you quick andelivery easy access to the phones apps This has been introduced before but the S7 has definitely taken a step in a more progressive fashion by introducing the ability to shortcut the functions within in app for even quicker access Ive already used the create event quick access multiple times for the calender app GPS access is a lot easier for when youre in the car to diminish phone usage while driving and even creating memos or adding an alarm are a slide and press away Theres so much more to these amazing devices Id love to keep sharing but the experience honestly resides within the phone itself Get this phone and indulge into its magic Did I mention VR This is the best phone me and my wife have ever had We both preordered the s7 edge phones and have not been disappointed yet As with all samsung phones keep improving them we cant wait for the note 6 to come out too we will be buying them This is by far the greatest experience Ive had with any smartphone From making phone calls to media socializing and paying my bills everything is just a finger swipe away Now with Samsung pay I love the expression on peoples faces when making purchases Thank you Galaxy Switched from the Note Series to the S7 Edge
Great features with the addition of the expandable SD card
Removable battery was not an issue as had no problems with
previous batteries in other model The S7 is a very functional smartphone Lots of potential My only issue is the design Using the typical smartphone hold my pinky blocks the speaker and Im use to the control buttons on the bottom part of the phone to be in the opposite order Also I find I have to use two hands to perform certain tasks because of reach Went from iPhone 5S to Galaxy 7 big difference in size of screen and features still learning but seams that it has more apps For one it doesnt have a flashlight anymore Also the message plus doesnt work with the custom ringtones like the other text does Doesnt have notes app built in I loved the phone and if it would work consistently it would be awesome Im not be sarcastic it really was a great phone but Ive had significant problems since week 2 of ownership Verizon did their best to help as they always do so they sent some signals through the air and it worked better for a couple days But in the past week it took on more and more problems and yesterday if shutdown and now I have to replace it The good news is that I fully expect Verizon will work this out as they have done for the past 21 years Ive been with them Great phone company Not a great phone in the end I love the improved feel due to weight and size over my previous S5 battery life and the use  return of expandable memory Its a very comfortable phone to hold and is definitely what I was looking for I love everything about this phone I would recommend it to anyone I love My phone It has A lot of features and aps really good Love the phone get it if ur contemplating it just get it The phone is so much and more I am not a big on jumping from phone to phone just because the new model has come out My first smart phone was the galaxy 4 I was in love with it then here comes the 5 seven months after I got my four I was bummed out for a minute I got over it real quick A year later the six and six edge came on the market I was going to pull the trigger but hey my four is still kicking some major butt 
Then Samsung came out with Galaxy 7 oh me oh my I had no other choice all the features that comes on the phone had to get it Waterproof fingerprint lock the camera the operating system is so much better than before If you been looking for a do all end all phone grab the 7 cause once you put on the vr gear headset you will not take it off I like how it remembers and loads the applications from my previous Samsung 3 I also like new settings like ability to turn on and off notifications for each application The speakers audio and video  are much better The sound is the loudest yet So far Im loving this phone One of my favorite features is the mobile pay I know its not unique to the S7 but its my first Android phone Its really quick and responsive The only downside is some days the battery feels like it dies really quick while other days it will run a solid 20 hours Overall satisfied with the handset and the features Great work

Product to be part of samsung family The S7 is a great overall phone Excellent camera and camera modes and features Love the re addition of the expandable memory I do wish that Samsung wouldnt preload it with a bunch of useless apps and data that takes up much internal storage and are things I will never use But it has been great otherwise I dont mind the nonremovable battery because it is so new dont know if my mind will change as I hold on to it longer I upgraded from the Samsung S5 I did not upgrade to the S6 The S6 did not have a good user flow and did not have the capability of adding an internal storage card But Samsung listened The S7 is what I have been waiting for The S7 has a great user flow I am able to add an internal storage card up to 200gb One of the S7s terrific features is the lense on the camera A f14 lense lends it to Amazing low light conditions Thank you Samsung  I love the Samsungs They are easy to navigate even for a senior citizen My Samsung Galaxy s7 is amazing I love the way you can open more than one app at a time and the camera is great I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 I love this phone The battery holds up pretty well and the quick charger does just thatquickly charges The phone feels good in my hand and the screen is beautiful Im glad it still has a micro SD slot for storage The camera has some fun features that my S4 did not Overall I am pleased with my upgrade I am an Android fan and the Samsung phones are by far my favorites The familiarity is great if youre used to Samsung devices My only issue is Ive owned the note since a note 2didnt get the note 5 cause they took away the micro SD slot Kinda wish Id waited for the note 6 because after owning them the s7 seems small This phone has been amazing since day 1 my friends dare me to put it in water and text and I do so and just embarrass then and dare them to put there iphones in water and they refuse lol I love this phone im Glad the memory card is back i didnt get the s6 due to no SD card camera has been great cant complain Just got it a week ago and it already had a problem it froze when I was using it the screen went off and impossible to get it back on I took it back and they made it work again hopefully it wont happen again This phone is amazing Its every its hyped up to be and more The display is gorgeous The battery can last more than a day on full brightness The camera is very high quality and stable And the edge is a nice addition to the Galaxy lineup I would recommend this phone to everyone Love this phone the features and design a really fantastic I am completely satisfied with my galaxy S7 Edge Has amazing features and very realiable Team Samsung all the way Still doesnt have a removable battery but at least you added SDRAM This is my second Samsung phone and I am equally as please with this as I was with my original Samsung s5 Wish the price was not as high as it is but it is what it is Best phone that I have owned Very easy to use Great screen all images are crisp and clear People complain about it being a fingerprint magnet Most people add a case so it does not matter If that is the biggest complaint then critics are struggling to find faults with this phone This phones is super fast light and does more then I could have wished for I got to say that this phone by far the best Android phone period This thing is a beast Best phone Ive ever laid my hands on Truly is an all day battery vast improvement over the s6 The screen resolution is brilliant and the brightness is spectacular Honestly phones dont get better than this The fact its waterproof is above and beyond and sets the standard for the category The speed is great and the ability to add on storage is amazing I like the new size of it its a little bit smaller than my s5 didnt think I would like it but now that Ive been using it Im finding the more I like it especially all the extra features that it has and the extra memory it has is incredible I replaced my Galaxy S4 16gb with the Galaxy 7 Edge I am absolutely impressed with the 7 on every level The larger screen and keyboard are great and the ability to have apps on the edge screen ready and waiting is just wonderful Great Phone and Even Better Camera The waterproofing IP68 is the best too This is the best phone i have ever owned by far My last phone was a Galaxy S4 I love the Galaxy line s7 edge is really great with the unique design is feel like your on the top and also the looks is so elegant slim and very smooth to hold and the big screen is really great the performance is so fast so i enjoy it every time i browse the net and of course the camera is really really amazing you can take nice picture even if its dark and with VR Gear with it OH WOW its really a fun experience 360 degree is really brilliant its like bringing you to other dimension I could do so much with this phone itself IPhone doesnt even compete with this phone Features and design are on point Especially all the gear you can get to make this phone a better experience The camera on the gs 7edge is wonderful in low light and bright The phone will take an sd card to expand the memory The battery oh the love for the bigger battery I no longer have to freak out if I dont have a charger with me I can even watch movies listen to music talk text basically actually use my phone to its potential WITHOUT having to charge halfway through the day I upgrade from my current Samsung phone and love this phone The only thing I wish would be different is the sound quality from the speaker This phone is a true upgrade from the galaxy s6 No other company is releasing phones annually with as many new features as Samsung with their Galaxy lineup The battery lasts a full day with fairly heavy use the cameras photo and video features are above all others ive come across I love it This phone rocksI would highly recommend this product to anyone So far I have not had any problems and seems like a real nice phone minus the battery life which could be a little better and should have more internal memory with the technogy that is now available I cant right a true review till I have owned it for over 1 year since that is when electronics like to act up I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and was blown away by how much I was missing with my old iPhone I absolutely love the customization that android offers and the build quality of this samsung phone is superb Two of the most prominent features that really grasped my attention when looking into buying a new phone were the expandable storage and the water resistance that my new Samsung phone offers An added bonus that grabbed my eye more than anything was the edge display Even if you arent looking to use the features it offers its hard to deny how beautiful it looks The seeming lack of bezels is something I really enjoy about this phone I would highly recommend it to someone and have already recommended it to many friends Tried the iPhone 6s for a week but ended up returning and getting the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge Best decision ever The Galaxy is a great phone love being able to change the phone display and fonts Theven galaxy is way better than the iPhone 6s This phone blows my old galaxy s4 out of the water best purchase I have made in ages Great phone lightweight easy to navigate love the graphics would highly recommend absolutely love this phone Was able to adjust to the new phone quite easily The camera is great Everything is working well for me I really enjoy this phone has a wonderful design I love the camera and its features Works really well when I am talking and using the Internet at the same time Has a good battery life since I am on the phone all the time I absolutely love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 Im still learning all the features it has to offer Its sleek design and pretty gold color definitely make me feel fashion forward Every once in awhile when I dial out it gets hung up and I have to redial but its not deterred my perception of my new phone My favorite feature is the high quality pictures I am able to take This phone is definitely top of the line Everything flows smoothly with this beast of a phone Id recommend this phone tor anyone who wants a lot of bang for their buck Well done Samsungwell done I am completely blown away by everything this phone has to offer The low light camera is beyond amazing This new phone is amazing The design is great And the battery life is outstanding I would definitely recommend it The edge screen shows notificatons and you can set what you dont want to display I n the setting easily Some android phones are complicated however this is easy but not super easy to use I recommend this product to my grandmother who also finds Galaxys easier to use rather than her old phone No issues with this phone whatsoever So glad that the SD card was added back to Samsung phones Not to mention it is also waterproof Apps run great on the improved processor and the camera takes great looking pictures and video I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 excellent sound quality
love s voice and s health This is the first Samsung I have bought I have had it a couple of weeks and I think it is great It has the best camera I have found Very reliable and the battery lasts quite well Love the look and feel of this phone Light weight rounded corners and perfect size Phone pairs great with my Tab S2 Battery life is outstanding Picture quality is fantastic Great upgrade from my HTC One M8 As a Geek Squad Agent I highly recommend this phone You wont be disappointed The only thing Ive noticed that is a little off is when you have the phone horizontal my hands tend to cover the speakers Other than that perfection Love the water resistance as I am constantly on or near the water have had this phone for about 2 weeks now the first thing that got me was the battery life its never ending plus the supercharging its excellent although it does had some draw backs I prefer not putting a case on my iPhone but for this phone i think Im going to have to I can already see small almost micro scratches across the screen and back even where the finger sensors are also if you plan on taking it into the shower be prepared to not have the speaker at full capacity for a while but other than that I cant stop messing with it I find myself going back to the phone and tinkering with it since I never had that ability with an iPhone I love how I can go from being home to the car and every setting and option can be switch by nfc overall a great phone I have been extremely pleased with my new phone Changing from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge The Edge is so much more user friendly I am loving it When I first heard about all the features that this phone had to offer I was speechless The design is sleek comfortable and a jaw dropper The performance is under rivaled I can run anything smoothly and I love it The battery is a huge improvement over last years flagship s6s6 edge Bringing back the micro SD card slot was genius I think that the most exciting part of this phone is the IP68 rating I feel relieved not having to worry about dropping my phone in water or anything like that Congratulations Samsung youve created the first perfect smartphone This is hands down the best phone Ive ever owned Waterproofing extra storage beautiful edge display great camera and for the first time in my life a phone that actually gets me thru a full day Good work samsung Im really happy with this product im really happy with my galaxy s7 This phone is great I love the sleekness and the camera is absolutely Fantastic With the Smart Switch feature transferring all my data was super simple I keep finding new little things that make it better every day Like bringing up a day on my calendar and it shows the what the weather is supposed to be like that day Fabulous phone This phone is an upgrade from a Galaxy S4 Active I cant say enough good about it My main concern with the S4 was the camera speed and quality The S7s camera is lightning fast Overall everything is faster on this phone The display on the S7 is so bright that I keep it on half brightness The battery life is amazing The S4 would loose 1012 percent of the battery overnight The S7 only drops 46 percent It feels very solid in the hand To preface I am a Note 3 user upgrading to a S7 Immediately the battery life was an instant improvement and the camera with the new device I have no issues making calls with Cricket coverage Wifi or texting I had to get used to the smaller form factor but that was not an issue The display is great and no real issues with the phone after 2 weeks of use I would recommend this to others I did not give it a 5 in overall rating and features as I would reserve raising it until I had the phone for at least 6 months I was going back and forth between a few options and once I handled it in a store my choice was made Thanks again for a great product Great phone Would recommend it to everyone Exceeded my expectations I cant believe the battery life on this thing I would recommend this phone to all my friends The camera is fantastic Nice job Samsung GREAT PHONE AND GREAT FEATURES I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GALAXYS Love everything about this phone from the shape to all the features it has Currently obsessed with the camara takes awesome pictures very clear This is a great device I love using it It is fast lightweight and has lots of memory for my music I have had my Samsung S7 phone for 2 weeks now and I cant believe how much faster it is than the S5 I had previously Add that to a bright clean display and easy to use features this is the phone to have I love the Apps that are available especially Samsung Pay It is easy to use and accepted virtually everywhere a card can be swiped or waved I really like the feel of the phone It is thinner and lighter than my S5 was and yet still has a feeling of strength Overall I really love it Great phone Light weight durable and lightning fast This is one of the best phones I have done owned Great performance Long time fan of Samsung they keep getting it right  The s7 is very confortable to start Responsive and fast External memory via SD card is a plus in my book The colors on the screen pop unlike any other phone Ive seen on the market I love my new phone and Im satisfied with just about everything Have had it for a week WHY DID I WAIT Not too big bigger than the III incredibly quick Like it a lot This phone is so easy to use and has an amazing camera it is a wonderful product I highly recommend it What a great device Ive gone back and forth from galaxy to competitors for the past four years especially after the those competitors blew up I had the s4 and s5 active then made the jump back to the competitors but everything was ultimately the same as every other of the competitors product I decided to switched back to the s7 edge when I upgraded again and just three days in I couldnt be more satisfied The quality and features are uncomparable There are so many more features on this phone than expected Highly recommended Fastest and without a doubt best cell phone I ever had I went from the S6 Edge to the S7 Edge and I fell inlove all over again The extra edge features are amazing and super easy to use I love that the SD slot has returned and the water resistence feature without the extra bulk makes me so happy I no longer have to watch myself as much when I am around a toilet or pool The S7 Edge is the best product yet created by Samsungincluding the VR Thanks The camera on my galaxy s7 edge is everything The clarity is amazing and gives the best pictures The phone setup itself is great and I love the big app buttons Still learning my phone and enjoying it as I go along Great phone  camera is outstanding Wish battery life was better but I did not want the edge as it was too big This product very reliable and robust excellent camera I really like the new S7 but the cases for it make the phone quite hard to use all the features 
Other then that I have had no problems

Battery life Is a little on the weak side for me This phone is so much fun Works great paired with my Galaxy tablet Awesome design Cant wait to add the VR headset Got my phone a week ago and was pleased and happy that I picked the S7 Pleased with the camera and speed Battery life could be better but I am still overall satisfied with the S7 I used an iPhone 4 previously and thus phone is so much better I dont think Ill ever go back to Apple phones Everything except performance is as good as or better than advertised That is actually not as bad as it sounds because the performance shortfall is only in two areas that I have found so far The first and probably least important to most people is the Bluetooth I am comparing it to my previous phone which was a Galaxy S5 Neither the range nor the quality of the Bluetooth signal is as good with the S7 as it was with the S5 The other area that I find lacking is battery life I know they claim it has a more robust battery but a full charge does not last nearly as long with the S7 as it did with the S5 I have changed absolutely nothing as far as apps or usage are concerned and need to charge the S7 twice per day when only once was more that adequate for the S5 I do however love the fact that they did away with the flapper that covered the charging port That was not someones better idea I have had my S7 for about a week The device operates wonderfully Compared to the S5 the S7 camera is great I hated the delay on my S5 I dont like the rounded glass as screen protectors dont fit well not s7 edge No problems with battery life and I run location and blue tooth all day Since apps cannot be moved to SD card I think there should be more memory I anticipate problems in the future One of the best samsung phones Ive had yet Performance of the phone is top of the line Multitasking is great Display is great The edge design is cool and makes it different than most Camera is probably one of the best out there No need for point and shoot cameras with pro mode Use with the oculous vr is amazing Only complaint is after a month of use The paint on the ear speaker started fading Just a little thing but overall really good phone This phone is clear fits well in hand offers micro SD card great sound clarity water resistant  I love this phone Best phone ever I love my new S7 Edge Speed shape and performance is want gets me the most I really cant compare anything to my new phone because its just a great piece of art I use my edge shortcuts a lot making it easier to get to my top apps and favorite contacts with ease Samsung did a great work on this and making it waterproof was just excellent Samsung Galaxy is by far my favorite phone I switched from an iPhone 3G to a Galaxy S4 years ago and recently used my upgrade to get the new Galaxy S7 I absolutely LOVE it There are a good bit of new and improved features all of which are a plus Keep up the great work Samsung I just very happy that Samsung made the phone with expandable memory I love everything about this phone I recommend everyone get one Fast and great new features Im really enjoying Samsung Pay I try it everywhere I shop and just like the commercial the clerk says that wont work here and then the CC terminal beeps I upgraded from the S4 to the S7 Im very happy with the phone as a whole very low learning curve Nice feel to the phone with a nice display Happy they give you the opportunity to use a SD card Nowadays the base memory on phones should be 64Gb as apps are taking up more of the phones storage Great beauty with a sleek design Great new features makes Samsung my top choice Love the S7 Just wish it was a little larger I had gotten comfortable with the Note 4 Besides that Its the Best I have had the galaxy S7 for a month and am still learning what it offers in features and apps It seems to have better reception and a much better battery life I would highly recommend the S7 to anyone who is looking for a new phone I work a lot from my phone My s7 can keep up with multi tasking and repetitive phone calls The battery can last me all day which is saying something Though my voice cabanas need updated or something because svoice doesnt always respond this is sure a beautiful phone good job samsung Ive had Samsung products since the Galaxy SIII and I have to admit the S7 is the best phone to date Can wait for the Note Edge to come out because that will be my next upgrade I love how fast I can access the camera and immediately focus on what I want to get pictures of No more making people awkwardly wait while I try to get my camera to focus properly The edge panels allow me to keep my home screen nice and clean with my everyday apps easily accessible I am so happy I switched The features and ease of use of this phone plus the beautiful camera and the ability to expand storage Im sold Well worth the switch Its quick to learn and get used to from being a previous iuser I got the hang of it pretty fast Kudos Samsung Fast and quick some features on old S5 missing curve screen issues with smaller hands It a good phone i like the phone i just dont like that it be freezing all the time To me itseems very similar to my S4 cost about the same The 1st week with my s7 was glorious Long lasting battery excellent camera 
Two weeks and 2 software updates later the device LOST 20 battery OVERNIGHT while on the charger The android system used 47 battery 
Currently I was 100 this morning I am at work and not able to use my phone My battery is b at 60 with android system using 39 
Ridiculous Love the new features in this phone like the heart rate monitor and the finger print security Camera quality is amazing and I just love the ease of use from this rad phone Overall excellent android phone performance and feature wise Unfortunately the case is extremely fragile Mine shattered when I tapped the phone on a payment terminal I believe the corner of the terminal hit the glass just right to crack it Any way why make a beautiful phone if it cant be used uncovered in the real world I love my S7 Edge The battery life is amazing I can go all day without needing to charge it The wireless QI Fast Charger is also a great feature Love being able to just set it down at night without having to plug in any wires Camera is also amazing Nice phone Battery weaker than expected Not enough accessories yet Besides the constant over heating issues I have it is an over all awesome device Had the phone a couple weeks and so far so good I switched from an iPhone 5s and dont regret it The screen is incredible Previously I found myself avoiding my iPhone to cruise the web but now I find myself using my S7 edge quite often Switching to the android platform is the hardest adjustment 

Also the size is the hardest issue to get used to and it is built for twohanded typing but does offer a setting for more onehanded typing that I have not tried yet Moving from a windows phone back to a droid you never know what you have until it is gone

The GS7 edge is awesome I am so satisfied i bought one for the wife whom is very picky she loves it The VR is very cool as well and looking forward to the new apps coming for it The only thing I would like to see is support for the marketplaces around movies to allow XBox Amazon etc rather than the Samsung store Open markets is best for the consumer Just got this phone 2 weeks ago upgrade from my S5 Skipped the s6 because of the loss of the sd card so glad they added it back to this phone Still learning all the new features but totally love it
This phone is slightly smaller than my s5 but packs way more power and performance into this little package Not overly large screen a benefit easy to hold on to Great display and quick response IP68 rating is a huge bonus and benefit Great camera love the use of Android 6
Samsung brought back the MicroSD card awesome Definitely a huge plus
Small issue with wireless fast charge no longer working Suspect an Android update or some other software update issue that disabled wireless fast charge from working exactly right tested on two 2 different fast charge wireless charges same result regular wireless charging still nice and good to use just no notification that fast charging is happening Fastest charge done via cord of course

Overall great phone glad I made the switch I really wanted to like the phone But it wasnt for me coming from a note to the regular galaxy line was made thingsome cumbersome My wife loved it But I opted to go back to the note for ita larger display and its most awesome s pen This phone is great for anyone who runs multiple apps at the same time Seamlessly switch between apps and multitask your multiple tasks The battery last me all day on a single charge at night Five stars all the way keep it up I love every inch of this device The speed design  engineering applications available and backed by Samsung The S7 is a beautiful thing I love just about everything about this device but I do have gripes about the fact that Samsung decided to leave out Quick Charge 30 just because Exynos chips dont support it Theres no reason to cripple the devices that can use it Either that or let us have replaceable batteries I would prefer QC30

I also wish they kept the IR blaster but Im not as worried about that Everything else about the device is fantastic except the locked bootloader If you dont plan to root your next device I would absolutely recommend it To be honest Id probably recommend it over root able device anyway its so good When I woke up i was set on getting the note 5 Then was swayed into the s7 edge for its expandable storage And since then Ive been experiencing a truly amazing life remote On top of all of its amazing features samsung itself still continues to impress me there constantly giving away things to those who support them Keep up the great work My new Galaxy S7 is phenomenal The low light photography for me is the key feature It is amazing I also love the ability to fast charge as well as it wirelessly charge my phone My S5 Active I was able to utilize why i rambunctiously lived life with its waterproofness and Im glad this phone has that as well My call Quality and speed of processing while using it is much more increased from my old phone and I wouldnt give this thing up Good fone as good as the mega I got a must have love it Love the design and feel of the phone However the screen is too sensitive Every time I unlock the phone I end up activating the split screens Also the speaker volume is not loud enough I was upgrading form a Galaxy S4 so there are many improvements The battery is good not great I liked being able to have a spare battery charged to switch out on the S4 which it doesnt seem can be done with the S7 The display is awesome and slightly larger but not overwhelmingly than the S4 There have been some glitchy issues with a few apps that worked just fine on my S4 so perhaps some compatibility issues with the new OS I have not tested out the waterproof feature so cant comment Being able to insert a large SD card is a great feature to expand memory The quality of the camera in low light is unbelievable  Great product from design point of view
 Like the Samsung Pay feature really hasslefree Ive had a few Samsung Galaxys in the past but havent had one in a few years I was a little hesitant because it is a fairly expensive phone but Im glad that I got it Its a wonderful phone with many great features and I would recommend it to just about anyone Even my fiance who switched from and Iphone loves hers Jumped from s5 to s7 never looked back I previously had the Galaxy S6 and the S7 blows it out of the water Everything is so much smoother and faster Best of all the battery is 1000X better Couldnt be happier with my purchase I love the galaxy phones and this s7 is by far the the best No phone beats it Design is very sleek display is beautiful crisp outstanding color Performance is outstanding Hate the autocorrect of keyboard ridiculous corrections takes more time to correct the autocorrect Bought it because of the return of the SD card if it wasnt on there I wouldve stayed with the s5 Overall very satisfied with performance and speed of Samung 7  I like the lightweight of phone along with awesome camera I have had Samsung products from television to smartphones S5 I gave my S5 to a family member who was in much need of a new phone Deciding if I should go back to Droid or stay with Samsung I am not persuaded so easily by retailer incentives but with the actual smartphone feel and testing I read some not so popular reviews by the first wave of consumers that live by the  Must Have with the S7 having this flaw and that flaw blah blah blah but for those who use it as it is intended for 1 an actual phone that you actually carry a conversation by far the clarity is amazing regardless of the surroundings  of course weight is a factor this is light weight and sleek which was no surprise some perks EASY to transfer data over S7 very user friendly for those who are not savvy in the world of gadgets The camera is crisp  like the commercial says Low Light takes amazing photos There are plenty of some you will use others no but they are all easy to access and operate  The flaws not being a fan of finger prints the metal look has smudges and the price is not too easy to take but in the end its all worth the bang for the buck it will be a long time before you upgrade this S7 will be around for a long time I really like that it is water resistant I have kids that like to play with my phone by water so I like the new Samsung Galaxy s7 edge n Gear s2 I got this phone 10 days ago and I absolutely love it I decided to go with something other than my iPhone as I wanted expandable storage I had a few other gripes about the iPhone that I wont get into I was a little reluctant to try Android as I was afraid that it would be less userfriendly After about one day of using it I was hooked on this phone

Pros

 Beautiful screen with vivid colors
 Size is about perfect for me I dont want anything bigger
 Its really fast Apps open and run very quickly Fingerprint recognition is really fast
 I could write a ton on ease of use Its very easy to navigate and do stuff In my opinion even easier than an iPhone I love the ability to close all Apps at once by clicking a single button Its so easy to transfer files such as music from your PC by just clicking and dragging Byebye iTunes and all its issues
 Battery life is about the same as an iPhone based on my usage profile You can get a full days worth of use without recharging if you arent on it constantly andor playing games
 You can get a lot of extra battery life by activating Power Save Mode
 Charges in about 1 hour and 15 minutes with fast charger
 Camera is awesome

Cons

 No easy way to sync with Outlook for contacts There are some 3rd party apps that do this but they arent as good as iTunes
 Slow motion video camera doesnt allow you to zoom Kind of a bummer if your are doing sports video Ive been eligible for upgrade since last year but I waited specifically for this phone because I knew itd be worth it Though Im still disappointed Samsung made the decision not to release a white colored phone here in the US as its personally my favorite color Im really loving the gold color and how it changes tone in different lighting The fingerprint visibility is unfortunately very high but it isnt a deal breaker The phone itself is great and an incredible upgrade from the S4 which I have loved dearly over these last two years the size is only an inch bigger and its more narrow than the S4 which is a plus for someone with small hands like me The battery life is SUCH an upgrade from the S4 and though I dont think its quite as good as advertised and reviewed its still fantastic The longest Ive gone without a charge and I havent even let it fully die yet is well over 8 hours and even then it was only down to 15 with extremely heavy use The camera on this phone is fantastic too I have no idea what the S6 camera was like but the S4 was far from cutting edge I spent a day taking pictures in various lighting and every single one has turned out great Im also extremely glad that expandable storage is back because its a necessity these days My only complaint is that I did not receive an SD Card Tray Removal Tool with my phone like I was supposed to and since I live in a dorm with significantly less things around than I would have had at home I ended up having to unbend a staple to get it open The phone is fantastic and the fast charger included is REALLY fast  it literally charges my phone 10 in five minutes I havent tested the extent of water resistance yet but one of my friends got the phone as well and was bold enough to pour a cup of water over it with no damage whatsoever so it looks like its well done I really really adore this phone Another great Samsung product I have many many phones over the years and some had good and bad qualities This phone is by far the best Ive used I have yet to find something I do not like about it Thank you once again samsung You have a lifelong fan Only negative issue it the fingerprint log on Works sporadically but the PIN backup is flawless
Camera is much improved from the S4 that we owned I bought this after I had my S5 stolen I initially did not know how to feel because I liked having a battery I could myself replace After a while it has been great and my phone is so sleek and doesnt scratch at all I can vouch it is waterproof I highly recommend it Totally well worth the wait once I saw the phone in person in stores I knew this was the phone for me I go the phone 1 week ago Glass back plate cracked within 2 days just from being in my pocket originating where the light is on the back Several applications do not work on the s7 not supported yet I would assume I am very pleased with my new S7  I switched from S5 when I switched to Verizon I was happy with my S5 and I thought the S7 would be very similiar Much to my pleasant surprise this phone is a definite step up Its a thinner phone the camera has improved and I have better sound quality I was also happy to learn that it has better water protection I am a satisified customer The camera is fantastic and the brightness of the screen is an improvement over previous models The reflection of bright light on the screen does however need some tweaking as it makes it very difficult to see in sunlight While it has been necessary to learn some new techniques and I still do not understand all of the changes I do very much like the S7 It is important to use the right case though as it is slippery That said the slipperiness makes it easier to put in a purse pocket it also makes it a little harder to get out That is why it is important to get the right case Wireless charging is better I like this phone a lot the curve and always on display make it easy to find things out without having to turn the phone on therefore saving battery power This is the best phone I have used yet The camera is great and the performance is terrific One of the best things about the phone is the battery life is very good Could always be better but is the best I have seen yet I had the note 3 and note 4 before I really liked them just not the size Everything so far with the g7 is amazing and I learn new things everyday The 2 reasons I wanted a upgrade was the waterproof factor and smaller size Wireless charger is awesome
 The camera is pretty amazing too
 Highly suggest Although Ive only had the S7 edge for 1 month now I couldnt be more pleased with its features

Battery life is great and it takes flawless pictures with no camera setup Im very happy with this phone Works quite well thus far No complaints except it does run a little slow at times in comparison to my previous Galaxy S6 Good battery good performance good price
I love the battery life and waterproof I bought this phone 12 days ago Battery life does not last long not user friendly Uses a lot of data and has to search for internet signal We have a booster at work and it still has to search for signal Just received my new phone yesterday  got everything transferred from the old phone to the new  love that new feature with the transfer cord So far so good Still learning what all is on this phone Best galaxy that I have owned yet Love the camera the best and so fast Only thing I miss is the IR from the S5 but not a deal breaker I went from the Galaxy S5 right to the S7 and what an amazing different as far as Speed and Performance my only gripe is with the placement of the headphone jack and speaker having the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone is a little awkward and as far as the speaker it is definitely better on the bottom rather than the back of the phone but being on the bottom my hand tends to cover the speaker when viewing videos and also sounds a little awkward only coming from one side of the phone maybe A2 speaker design would be nice and maybe a slightly different placement where my hands will not be covering the speaker My family has been Samsung fans for about 8 or9 years I get almost every new one that comes out I even own a Samsung smart tv refrigerator washer and dryer Great brand I love Samsung products I bought the s7 and s7 edge My kids have the 6s We have all been loyal to Samsung for about 8 years now This phone is so fast so beautiful The screen is so gorgeous you dont want to hardly touch it All the apps open so fast The battery lasts forever between charges And you can put a Micro SD card in it to expand the memory Samsung you are the BEST The phone is not complex at allThe camera gives you great quality pictures and the battery life is great I was afraid I wasnt going to like the size The size is great
I was afraid I wasnt going to like it as much as my old phone I LOVE my Galaxy S7 Edge
I was afraid I wouldnt be able to do everything I did on my old phone The Galaxy S7 Edge does more Love the design excited to use Samsung pay great phone all around Takes amazing pictures and has a very sharp screen Love it compared to my old phone Glad I switched Features are great VR is amazing large screen and easy to use Im still trying to figure out all the features Pros 
Fast really fast doing anything
Great screen fantastic resolution
Fit and finish 
Expandable memory
Cons
Really only one the edge is very touchy and when handling the phone you can trigger apps or processes inadvertently
Bottom line this is the best galaxy device yet I absolutely love my new Galaxy S7 Edge Compared to my last phone which was it S5 its night and day in my opinion this the best phone on the market and I love it I have had my S7 a month or so now Great phone This is the third Samsung phone I have had My S5 was still working great but I liked the features on the S7 Edge and I was ready for a new phone The Edge display is nice lots of screen to watch videos view pictures etc Good performance very fast processor Web browsing seems a bit faster than other phones I have owned I got the Gear VR goggles with this but I have not had a chance to try them yet I am looking forward to the Sports Illustrated Swim Suit issue in virtual reality Calls are crisp and clear on ATT No complaints about this phone So glad they put the SD card back but I wish they had come up with a different carrier for it The combined SD cardSIM card carrier is a bit difficult to manage at times I almost lost my SIM card the first time I took the carrier out to put my SD card in the slot It went flying Fortunately I was able to find it Other than that this is a great phone I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a state of the art phone I upgraded from the S4 and this phone is the best phone It is easy to use and has so many great features my s4 did not have Battery depletion is faster than I would like but I am getting use to changing things to help with battery drain The camera on this is great It is just that simple best phone I have ever owned Used to be an iPhone user and will never go back it will be Galaxy forever I love the camera quality Every picture I take has great quality even during the night The camera is fast and I love the design of the phone The long lasting battery barely last a day with average usage I charge it twice a day if it gets much use Never ever had to do this with my iPhone Other than that it is a great phone This is by far the best phone I have ever owned I love the fingerprint option It is so easy to just touch the home button I talk text email and surf the Web all at the same time I love this phone Ive owned multiple Samsung devices over the years several Galaxy phones Notes  the Tablet and each one was more outstanding than the next These days a phone upgrade is fractional You are getting better and faster but its not a major change After a week with the Samsung Edge 7 I can tell you this baby is a glass Ferrari Its fast sleek and feels like it will break anytime Its also a little glitchy Not sure if its the android or just the responsiveness of the phone My fingers got me into trouble real quickly and I dont even know how Could be some user error or getting used to the phone size but its annoying



Now lets face it nearly everyone buys a case for these phones but I havent yet and this past week was filled with caution and paranoia I cant see this phone surviving any type of drop and I dont want to test it Its made of pure glass and a little aluminum in the back Its slick and I found myself keeping my hands below my friends as he played with it to make sure I caught it if he dropped it As the week went on I was less paranoid but mindful that one careless moment will mean the end Ordering a case tonight



Now the good news Compared to a S5 this phone is a major upgrade for speed screen and a better battery life slightly I did the comparison with my friends S5 So if you are a power user you can justify the purchase because your productivity will increase The email client is better in this version of GMAIL and the camera is better which all the reviews have stated The SCREEN The tour de force of this phone Its pretty special Turn up the brightness and you can see a video from across the room Stunning Previously had the 5 I had heard the batter life was improved but that is not the case at all I dont even use it that heavily but the battery barely makes it through the day The graphics and features are very good and it is pretty intuitive and functions well The phone genearly works greatly The battery lasts really for a whole day with heavy use and lasts more with light use The camera is very good akso but I have noticed that it is not perfect with low light photos maybe I have to change the settings of camera I am still exploring its features
Also I noticed that few glitches with the this touchwiz Also it happened once or twice that the phone restarted for no reason Sometimes typing on the touch keypad and deleting letters drive me crazy as it freezes or becomes uncontrollable When me and my wife both got the Samsung gs7 edges we are very happy with the phones We have had the Galaxy S3 the Galaxy S4 and the note 4 there is no way you can compare them phones to the Galaxy S7 Edge this phone has everything you would want in a phone So thank you Samsung for building the best phone ever the Galaxy S7 Edge is a beast of a phone me and my wife loved it Very pleased with the many capabilities of this phone Learn every couple of days something else that can be done with this devise Has the best display and camera I have ever seen on a phone and the expandable storage is very useful the only con is the battery life I love Samsung this is my 3rd phone upgrade and I think Samsung is the best phone out there Easy to use the pictures are great links to my tv and computer with no issues Lots of other perks This is my first Smart Phone An upgrade from a Flip phone Quite a learning curve Some of the things I have having issues with are 1 My fingers and the small keyboard Many errors in data entry 2 The phone deciding to go from portrait to landscape seemingly without any conscious action on my part 3 During entering information if I squeeze the phone its slippery it seems to wipe out all the stuff I so painstakingly entered IRRITATING Im stilll getting used to it It seemingly has a lot of features but I need to spend a lot more time getting used to it The look and feel of the S7 Edge is amazing I have never had a phone have the screen size this big and still feels so small in the hand The camera and performance is incredible If you are like me I depend on my tools for everything The S7 is by far the best tool in my tool box Its fastsits comfortable in your hand and can pretty much adapt to whatever you need To sum it upITS THE MUST HAVE GALAXY PHONE I have really enjoyed the S7 so far love the Samsung Milk Music Im used to being able to access Windows devices so Im still skeptical to trying out other phones This one is quite a shocker and not what you would consider the same as Windows It delivers other apps that would never be used by nonandroid users It is a change for me and it does have a better picture but lacks some of those ideas we Windows users to consider comforting All said it is worth trying it just broaden your horizon I have my own business and this takes awesome videos and pictures The customizations that you have for this phone is awesome Love the big screen and love the rosegold color Works great almost all the time Only small issues with the phone restarting which I think OS The design is great I love the technology that went into this device Its outstanding Great job once again Samsung I upgraded my Samsung Galaxy S4 to the Samsung Galaxy S7  I absolutely love it The camera is a amazing upgrade as well The phone function is simple and easy to use I really like the fact that I dont have to jail break it like the iPhone I made the switch to Samsung products in 2009  Ill never go back Im very pleased that the external storage was brought back  I was going to get the Galaxy 5 note before I realized I could get the new S7 for that very reason External storage because Im a mom and I take tons of pictures and videos I also was partly worried because the back is not accessible I am fine with that after having gotten use to it The battery life thus far is great I have not had trouble with it not holding a charge So thats a plus I am currently awaiting the arrival of the watch That is a major bonus Since I have kids that like to try to play with my phone I wont have to carry it All the time I must say the fact that the phone is water resistant to a point its a wonderful addition The screen brightness is good The auto brightness actually performs much better than the S4 by far I did purchase the charging pad That is so awesome I can just take my phone out of its case set it down and boom I wake up to a charged phone without the Hassel of plugging it in wrong both ways because we all know it never fits and you fumble with the port That way I dont ruin the charging port  My S4 the prongs got kinda loose So the charging pad will save your phone Its worth the money to get one samsung of them Thank you Samsung for your great products Typically when you buy a phone for design you get the same beautiful polished look without any innovation cough iPhone you get a phone without any innovation to take advantage of while living your daily life because other parts of the ecosystem are lacking or introduced far after the phone launch You get a device that promises to do everythingbut the catch is that you have to wait until the rest of the ecosystem catches up to what the phone can deliver But not with the galaxy S7  S7 edge Finally A device that can not only stand up to an elegant design it also has the guts to prove it But no wait theres more You can actually do what it was intended for right out of the box Want

efficiency Ive played all the major brands and by far this phone is the best at every aspect for every part of my daily life Get the S7edge Trust me youll regret it if you dont in the beginning middle and end of your day So  hashtag dont be a sad panda with the other thing in your pocket be a happy giraffe and reach your point of enlightenmentwith the Samsung Galxy S7 edge Excellent quality clarity of screen ease of use awesome camera Im a huge samsung fan and this phone does not disappoint The features on this product go beyond any features of all the other phones on the market Easy to use and understand samsung did a very good job on this one brought back waterproof and the sd card which was the S6 killer lot of people skipped that one i cant say one bad thing about the S7 sleek design great sound and the water resistantce feature is awesome Love the display color and performance of the phonenice slick curved glassside bar is wonderful Fantastic cameravery lightweight easy to handle I was concerned with losing my stylus but this phones speed comfort and size has by far overcome my one and only concern of a stylus great phone like the way it fits in my hand like the pictures it takes very vibrant I have always purchased Samsung products since I was a teenager Not because Samsung is better than everyone else but because Samsung tries to give consumers what they desire The Galaxy S6 was awesome but I was disappointed that Samsung removed some key features from it hence why I never upgraded The Note 5 was still missing expandable storage and water resistance Samsung listened with the S7 and gave consumers and loyal customers their storage and water resistance back and although Samsung didnt provide a removable battery they drastically improved battery size with the S7 and S7 Edge 
The S7 is a powerhouse The CPU runs like a waterfall and the 64 improved GPU runs games as smooth as butter The design is great BUT I dropped this phone once without a case on it and I totally dented and busted my volume down button rocker The design could use a little bit more physical damage resistance but overall there is nothing I dont like I use all of the stock apps and not third party because Samsungs UI on TouchWiz for the S7 looks wonderful Its vivid and organized The device feels premium and with the experience you get from using ityou know that your money is well invested in this device GET THIS PHONE Phone is fast and does everything I need Has a great camera Easy to use and pictures look great and bright
Like every thing about this phonegood sound when I listen to my music and when talking with someone This is undoubtedly the best phone I have owned yet It is so easy to use has all the features I could ever want and fits perfectly in my hand I know phones are always being improved on but I dont know what more anyone could want that this one doesnt already have This phone is amazing as a samsun user for years now I can confidently say this is a step above the rest I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy s7 three weeks ago I love the features of the s7 The battery life is awesome And the wireless charging is also a great feature you lay the phone on the charge and it charges really fast Takes great photos and has an excellent edit feature as well Just overall very happy that I selected the new Samsung Galaxy s7 I would recommend it very highly Thanks for an awesome phone By far the best phone Ive ever owned the camera the processing speed features ease of usage even the size is perfect The expandable storage and the water resistance are icing on the cake I will keep this phone until the s8 comes out but it has to be better lol Only one complaint the speaker volume it could have been much better Im still getting used to it but so far its great I went from the Note 5 so I like that I can use one hand to do pretty much everything on it The only part I have to get used to is taking selfies on snapchat lol Its hard to do with one hand because I touch the edges of the screen and not able to hit the picture button without done maneuvering on my part But I DO LOVE the easy access slide out tab I use it on the regular Cant wait to learn more features I really love the edge panel features on both sides of the device  Easy to use fast clear pics not heavy Nice step up from my S4 Would recommend to anyone So far Im very pleased with the phone its fast great resolution great camera improve battery battery life the upgrades that theyve made to the S7 are indeed noticeable and appreciated I am so happy Samsung went back to being able to use micro sd cards The phone is amazing and the functionality is way better than anything else on the market I highly recommend this phone to everybody and I challenge anbody with an iphone to tell me that this phone isnt great I got a S7 the day it came out I was excited because I was upgrading from a S3 Well Im now on my 3rd S3 because of all the glitches When it doesnt have problems and is working properly I love this phone It doesnt have the voice commands that I was able to use with my S3 but other than that the features are great The 1st S7 I had restarted itself one day and then the home button and others wouldnt work The second the touch screen went out and the 3rd cant read the pictures it takes It corrupts the data so nothing can read the pictures and I lose them Also when I move things from the phone to the internal SD card it erases it some times If Samsung could or would fix these issues the phone would be much better Oh and the battery is poor as well With me using the phone I have to plug it in about every hour and a half if not sooner But if Im not doing anything and its just sitting there Then it will last all day Its great with the new features and bringing back some from s5 that was missing on the s6 This device has top notch features along with unparalleled speed and stability Looks like the one of a kind that it is and preforms even better Battery life is awesome streaming music all day from not even a full charge The wireless charging is sweet will totally save my charging port from failure Phone is super comfortable easy to use and easy to see Totally Samsungs best phone yet Amazing engineering and design Gorilla Glass Yes Nicely curved smooth edges Finely balanced and just heavy enough to feel the high end quality Fits perfectly in my hand Buttons are tight and dont turn off and on easilyThe camera lens sits flush with the body Sound is much more truer then the tinny sounds of other high end phones I tried
SIM tray holds a microSD No more worry about storage memory Fingerprint sensor works perfect and is very fast
The display has all the features one could want Colors and fonts are crisp and sharp
The body and sides flow into the glass and looks so sleek The S7 resonates quality and craftsmanship like a fine watch Excellent job Samsung Pleased Phone is easy to use Photo r clear Light I am loving the new phone it is easy to use and comfortable only thing I wish there was was a way to block the drop down menu so that my child can not turn off the location and gps other than that the absolute best phone yet Great product Cant wait to see whats next from samsung Great phone I like that it has the expandable storage and so far the battery life and recharge time is better than predecessors Looks great runs smoothly awesome features Display is magnificent This phone has a beautiful look and great feel It has very excellent features such as the camera and very fast processor I would highly recommend this phone I like the phone it has a lot of good features I love Samsung music app and Google store where you can download all kinds of cool apps for free While I was impressed with the speed and battery life and ruggedness of this phone I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 I dont like the fact that I cant take out the battery and the UI is basically the same
But overall this is a great phone Ive had no issues from it thus far and will continue to purchase Samsung products Ive had the S4 and S5 before this The S7 blows those out of the water More internal storage better camera seems faster even when comparing them straight out of the box I love my new phone The picture quality is unbelievable and the speed is outstanding The only thing that bugs me is getting my voice mail for some reason I have to looking for it But I think that will be fixed by a upgrade pretty soon Other than that small thing this is the BEST phone I was that diehard iPhone fan you most likely know I refused to acknowledge any other phone as a viable option That all changed when I watched Samsungs dazzling presentation of their flag ship phones the Samsung Galaxy S7 ans S7 edge What really caught my fancy was the integrated cooling pipe over the cpu and gpu Never will I see a smart phone the same way again Samsung had run me away in the last year or two but I switched back with the S7 Edge Although there are no 100 perfect smartphones the S7 has me satisfied at the moment even though I am they type who switches through phones all the time This is the best phone I have had yet I love the length of the battery I am enjoying the versatility  the ease of access with the computer I also like the sound quality with music games  movies As well as being able to even watch a movie on it I have had my new phone for about 2 weeks and so far everything works great No dropped calls the screen is easy to see I can text faster on the larger keyboard and the audio is much better quality than my previous Samsung Galaxy phones 
My litmus test was using the S7 with my Phonak hearing aids My previous phone was pickup up an air rushing sound that interrupted my train of thought while using my phone I dont have this problem now Im able to use my phone to watch TV and listen with my hearing aids without disturbing anyone and no wires or headsets to get in the way 
Since most of my communications are via text I needed a keyboard that could work fast and efficiently without making too many typos Im still making some mistakes but not as many as before I dont know if this is due to the phone or because I still cant spell Oh well you cant expect everything Great phone though I like the phone but the wifi is horrible It keeps dropping and causes the phone to hang I have two S7s and they both have the same issue Other wireless devices in my home dont have any issues with my wifi I have read several blogs and a lot of people seem to have the same issues Verizon sent down a patch but it didnt fix the issue at all Hope they fix the wifi issues soon Wonderful phone and highly recommend it Would like more available info for ease of use We have had an iPhone and changed to Samsung will not change will keep the Samsung brand I preordered as soon as i could Love the edge design The expandable memory was also a plus since the S6 did not have that capability Overall i really enjoy the phone and i am excited to see what the future of the Galaxy phones will be I absolutely love Samsung products I own 6 products and I intend to buy at least 4 more in the next 90 days I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 and Im in my own heaven The screen display is beautiful The upgraded camera and low light camera clarity is awesome However I had to exchange my device s7 due to the screen flickering I now have my replacement and its freezing and unresponsive during and after charging for about 35 minutes I really hope Samsung can pull it together Design is very elegant and smart with a bit rounded edge Lot more functions added I am pretty surprised with the speed which is way faster than S6 by feeling Water resistant and VR system is other nice features I have had almost every Samsung phone since cell phones went touch screen capable I have been very happy with not only the over all performance function and style but also the quality I am pretty hard on my phone and every one Ive purchased has served me well never to disappoint I highly recommend Samsung as a brand and this newest addition to the lineup is no exception With the device being glass on front and back in am terrified it will break I have also had minefor about a month and the power and volume keys already quit working As far as the new system it is easier than ever to use Even my husband who is anything but tech savvy has made several comments on this being the easiest phone he has ever had Great cameral features and does very well in low light Switching between apps and having more than one app open at once is great Enjoy the Samsung health for watching trends on steps stress and heart monitoring Speaker is a big improvement over earlier models File transfer from S4 to S7 Edge was very easy Very pleased with my new phone I had a charging issue with my S5 and it was time to move up The S7 definitely runs smoother feels slimmer The battery life also seems improved which is good because i stream music through bluetooth into my car for about 4hrs a day 

The fingerprint unlock stunk eggs on S5 but i have no complaints on the S7 The camera features are nice and it has all the extra load ons I had on the S5 I am glad the edit photo feature works was was the support dropped on the S5

I use the gear fit watch and S health and the spO2 scanner added is a nice addition

Being able to record gaming videos naturally and being able to live stream to my youtube is a double plus My son has an iphone and it cant record using dual camerasi am glad this feature was continued on from the S5

I use Metal as a 3rd party facebook app to assist with battery drain it has crashed the phone twice Also my keyboard in the Verizon Message failed to load once

I used to be a Verizon Tech so not really a big deal

Thanks for the SD card port S6 didnt have one thats silly
audio jack on the bottom of phone is genius 1 because it makes the port not get lint when put in a pocket naturally top down and 2 because my headphone cord is no longer in the way

whats up with no removable battery odd I have owned 4 of the past galaxy phones all have been great I tried to go to an IPhone but went back to the samsung after 4 months this phone as with all in the past work great the camera is outstanding all in all I love the Samsung galaxy s7 phone Samsung keeps getting better Sleek design loaded with features I have seen this phone put to the water test and I was amazed to see it still working No reason to fear using the S7 in the rain I liked what I seen with the display which Samsung always out does themselves Also with Androids latest Marshmallow 60  customizations is endless Only draw back is overly sensitive touchscreen But this could be fixed with an update Would be cool to see an option to set sensitivity yourself like displat brightnes I would recommend this phone to any body that is tied of hearing how good the I phone is The s7 edge is by far the best phone I have came across Great speed and never an issue Edge might be a bit touchy and can be an issue instead of a benefit sometimes The reintroduction of the expandable memory is a step back in the right direction No removal battery once again not a fan but also not a deal breaker Making the phone life proof with the water resistance is a nice feature bonus

Only been using the phone a little over a week and no real time to tinker with it yet

More to come when I have had more time to really test it out I get comments on the looks of this phone daily camera is amazing battery life lasts me all day with no problem I love how with the included micro USB to USB adapter I can even charge my friends phones with mine This phone is absolutely incredible If I could change anything I would make it cheaper but hey Im sure this phone is not cheap to make 

Great Phone and would definitely recommend Great Job Samsung I like thats is water resistantthe screen colorbattery life Great features easy to use I use the camera a lot and it is very quick and takes outstanding pictures Edoes of the phone provide quick access and easy to customize for your use By far this is the best phone that I have had it blows I phones lg and others away Size is great easy to carry and easy to hold on to great speaking design Gotta love it I have had my Galaxy S7 Edge for about a month now and overall I am completely satisfied with this phone The display is so bright and the image quality is incredible Applications load and run quickly and without any bugs The battery is not exactly what I expected For the size I figured it would hold a charge all day with heavy usage but I find that by the time I get home it needs to be plugged in Not terrible but more average than I had anticipated Overall I am very happy with my Samsung S7 Edge and I would definitely recommend it to others Im loving this phone upgrading from an S5 The camera is amazing and I thought my S5 camera was good Ive only had it a few weeks but the performance is silky smooth and the screen is gorgeous Im loving the always on display and the built in wireless charging had to have a charging cover for my S5 Some complain about the lack of replaceable battery but I had an extra battery on my S5 and never used it Battery life is phenomenal As a bonus heres a refreshing new feature the sound quality during calls is way better than my S5 Wow a phone that actually does what its supposed to do Im also enjoying Samsung Pay The only negative is on my carriers part Verizon turned off some features that wouldve been convenient whitepages integration find my mobile This phone works so much better than my s5 In fact the s5 was a piece of junk compared to this So far it works fast and smoothly just as I would expect Prior to the Galaxy S4 I purchased other brands but will probably never again sway from Samsung I started with the Galaxy S4 shortly after it first came out and then approximately two years later the S6 With this Galaxy S7 everything I loved about the S6 was improved upon The S7 is the fastest phone yet I still cant believe it sometimes It actually spoils me as when I handle other peoples older phones that dont respond as quickly I start to get frustrated I dont even mind stepping down from the 64GB S6 that I had to the 32GB S7 because they brought the MicroSD card reader back If I need more storage at any point I just throw a card in There is not one spot I can really complain about versus the S4 or S6 this is a huge improvement in every way Good job Samsung I just bout this cellphone and is great I would recommend this product to anybody great investment  This is a new level of cell phone The bar set by the S7 is far above any other phone good job Very easy to transfer all my old stuff to new phone love it So much better pictures and battery last longer charges so fast  The new Samsung s7 has better features than my old IPhone 6 In addition the viewing and ease of seeing pretty much anything on this phone is above and beyond far superior than any IPhone I have seen to date Samsung did an outstanding job on this phone I like the capture screen feature the fact that you can swipe your hand across the screen is great Responsive and quick Operates smoothly and does everything I need Camera has fast focus color separation is clear sharp and bright Sound is superb specially using the earpiece Very quick charge Micro SD is back yippee Its a Machine Greatest Phone ever Samsung makes quality products that last IPhone is junk compared to Samsung Period This has been the best Samsung Ive had Ive been with Samsung now for 10 years and wouldnt change The only feature I really really miss is being able to voice control my music player It was so handy while walking or for hand free in my car The camera is amazing and Ive gotten great battery life Couldnt be more pleased There is not a whole lot of changes but there are some notable pluses with the new phone Overall it is a solid phone and I am still learning all of the nuances of this new phone Very short learning curve Enjoying all the features never before experienced Ease of use is most important for me a more mature adult From day one of buying this Phone I can almost watch the countdown of the battery draining away standard text keyboard sucksauto correct is terrible On the plus side it is faster then my galaxy 4 but the battery life is way better on my G4 Disappointing as its supposed to have good battery life I love the quickness of the camera and launching apps The battery life is great but that is expected for a new phone I guess Much louder speaker and clearer than my S4 I am glad I waited for this one I saw the S6 but wasnt ready to ditch my S4 My old phone messed up copying data over to new phone but hooked up cable as S7 did the rest Smooth interface and load times are great I havent tried getting it wet but it looks and feels like it can handle it Have been nothing but pleased with this phone Great performance quick charge and nice display The only negative is that it is frustratingly easy to hit the back and program switch buttons when touching the screen as well as tapping on the screen edge while holding the phone However I give it a pass because the reason for this is that the screen size is maximized for the unit This device is overall pretty decent battery life is something that has been improved The features are a step up as well however a few things that I have experienced in 2 weeks of ownership are s voice seems to have gone backwards is worse then it was on the s2 and other phonesas well as it seems that when Im using it for an extended time I start getting force closes on many appsphone itself doesnt seem to get hotso Im not sure if its over heating or not the look and feel of the device is quite amazing and I think once some of the software kinks are worked out it will be even more amazing I enjoy having the ability to upgrade the storage on my phone with the microsd slot The waterproof ability is nice When I heard of the features of the s6 I said I would wait until the next generation and I was not disappointed This phone is amazing Im a huge picture fanatic and I have to say the quality of the picture itself is amazing let alone the color and low light feature The display is phenomenal very bright and clear I went from a s5 to the s7 edge and I am in love with it Runs faster too and I still get to keep the water resistant feature The only problem I have is there is no cases that really protect your phone and especially the screen due to the edge screens so you need to be extra careful regardless of the case All in all a great phone definitely 5 star material I have been surprised how well everything works The only complaint is have is the battery dose drain quickly Its a great phone and the camera is awesome Great phone Love it Easy to use and snappy Has everything I wanted and a great camera Well I just bought it couple of weeks ago and Ive been using it a lot in order to see if the phone slows down but nothing happens finally  in my opinion this phone has what every Samsung needed an excellent processor I love everything about the new phone It is so easy to use and very fast Fantastic device Super awesome fun times absolutely This phone is awesome Screen resolution and brightness are top notch Camera and battery life are incredible No lagginess with anything on it Only complaint is the when operating with one hand my palm hits the curved edge interfering with my usage I cant believe how long it took me to switch to Samsung The s7 Edge is fast has an amazing image looks sharp takes phenomenal pictures and ontop of that I dont have to worry about water damage This is by far the best phone I have ever owned It has been a while since Ive had a newer phone There are so many features I absolutely love and others Im learning to love There are some operating features that still need to be worked out but otherwise great phone Rock solid stylish product  Super fast multitasking  waterproof and huge improvement in battery life I was an iphone guy for last 5 years Glad to switch to galaxy edge 7Only regret is with the stability of the andriod Some of the apps crash often Its time for samsung to push google to have stable appsos  100 excellent Would recommend to everyone Totally awesome I love the larger screen and design of the phone I appreciate that the power of button on the right is lower than the volume buttons on the right That was an issue with previous models Price is high The phone has a great display love the screen saver and also the camera Everyone should own a galaxy The best phones by far And I have owned a few different brands A product from Samsung that Im very impressed with go figure The S7 feels very natural in your hand Its a little slick so I got a case and I even love the size with a big protective Otterbox on the thing I love it so far and happily recommend to anybody looking for a new phone I have been a fan of the Samsung product line for a number of years now Since switching from that fruit phone I use my S7s features in every aspect of my real estate career The cameras quality is bar none The split screen feature allows me to view contracts and show pictures at the same time I highly recommend the S7 Ive had every edge style phone and this is by far the best I love the camera and the task edge screen I work for a major retailer so I have access to different brands and styles of devices but kudos Samsung for knocking it out of the park I really like my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge The battery life is much better than my last Samsung Galaxy and the processor runs faster Im disappointed that the area on the left of the home button no longer works like an information tab but now shows all of the open apps and allows one to chose an app or close them all with 1 touch This function was formerly achieved with a long press of the home button Otherwise I am very pleased with the phone This is quite a great device I love the design and many of the features

There are a couple of things that I find that could make this a MUCH better phone

1 The screen edge is a great concept with potential to add lots of functionality to the device but somehow its massively underused by the software That Ive found so far the side menu is the only feature that really makes use of it Scrolling with it is a bit clunky It seems to me a considerable increase on the price of the phone that is not really justified because of its underuse

2 I find that THE MAIN ISSUE with this phone is the nonremovable battery design To start so far I dont think the new battery has a great charge life Actually I find it worse than my previous Galaxy S4 I can imagine in the next 6 months it will degrade and eventually be useless With previous phones I found that after a while I need to replace the battery because they dont hold enough charge to function for more than a few hours sometimes minutes if I am using the GPS or browsing the web Its really frustrating to have a device that is out of juice ALL THE TIME often of course when you need it the most The alternative is to carry an external battery in my pocket which is totally impractical and stupid considering that I own a snazzy Samsung flagship phone So being able to replace the battery when I need it is an important feature that could easily make me consider a different brand in the next few months Easy to use I am glad they brought back the SD card thank you has all you need and morei love how it also offer apps you didnt even know existed I had a S5 and upgraded to the S7 I like most of the upgrades to the phone Only big gripe is that because the screen has a slight bend at the edges the good thick glass screen protector wont stay on around the edges and now I have ghosting and it isnt as sensitive when trying to type near the edges 
I dont like were the mic issometimes I have to hold the phone so I can speak directly into the mic because people cant hear me First off glad samsung decided to let us put SD card in the s7 had me worried dont care if cant take out battery but SD card is a must for music books and movies Fast processor have no problem running anything only thing I have to get use to is the edge side of screen I have big hands so when holding and typing or clicking on anything at first got irritated so should of gone with s7 but I like the edge screen just had to get use to it and I would recommend to any one even if you got big hands The S7 is a great handset  blazingly fast with a stunning display The camera performance is spectacular especially in low light and the fingerprint scanner works flawlessly most of the time My only complaint or concern is the quality of the cover glass used  compared to my Note 3 which I owned for 2 years and never had a single scratch scuff or imperfection the cover glass on my S7 was scratched within three days of ownership despite being meticulous in its handling Really easy to use great features cool easy to use functions One of the best phone Ive ever had Battery life is really long Also charges quite fast I work with a lot of cell phones and previously I had a iPhone 6 and changed to a galaxy s7 edge What a drastic change Ive fallen back in love with the galaxy The design feels better on the hand curved just right The processor battery life camera forget it everything is just much better Kudos galaxy I am forever a fan Great phone Easy to use I like the lines on the phone as will Everything about the new S7 is awesome I am so glad I made the switch Ive had the phone for 2 weeks and its amazing nothing but the best from samsung happy that the memory card slot is back to expand my storage I tend to have my device with a lot of media and pictures love the camera is crispy clear and has quick auto focus is awesome thats all i can say This phone not only looks and feels fantastic due to its curvature it also has a good number of useful Samsung features that makes this phone unique such as the always on and edge display Its battery lasts all day and the quick charging is fast so battery drain is not even remotely something to worry about The display is one of the most vibrant and beautiful displays on any smartphone The micro sd card slot supports cards up to 200gbs so you will have room to spare when taking tons of photos and videos which you will definitely want to do The camera does wonders compared to other flagship phone cameras in low light If you want the best smartphone camera for everyday use this phone has it The double tap feature to start the camera app is insanely fast and the cameras optic software and hardware allow the fastest focusing of a shot I have ever seen The phone speed is also blazing fast and you will experience little to no lag The phone is also water and dust resistant so you can use it nearly everywhere Overall this phone is the best on the market I like the video quality and the camera quality its way better than the S5 which I upgraded from I used to have the s6 it was a good phone but wasnt waterproof and didnt have an SD card slot The s7 has both of those important feature The main thing I love about the s7 is its amazing battery life I use my phone all day and it dies slowly I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who asks Also love the edge feature its easy to open apps I use a lot through the edge panel I am not very experiened with computers or cell phones but the Samsung products are great and easy to use Super easy to transfer from my S5 to the new S7 The camera is unbelievable Love it I love this phone My previous phone had nothing but problems from day one I am not sure I waited so long to switch The phone has exceeded my expectations I had the S6 and now have the S7 and love as much as I did the S6 camera is great its fast nice colors sharp phone I like everything about this unit From Looks to Performance it has really stood up to the test of my Quality of Lifes test I would not be happy if I look or had to give up this item Great job Samaung I was a adamant apple fan until the S7 Edgem Expandable memory is one of me favorite features thank you for bringing it back I love this phone The fact that it is water resistant and now having expandable memory is a plus The camera is awesome and the screen is great The speed is sweet being I get very impatient waiting for things to load Ive been a Samsung fan for years I was excited to switch to the S7 from the S4 and overall Im satisfied with the phone Slight differences in functionality from the S4 but not a whole lot of big changes Longer battery life based on what I do More storage which Im always a big fan of since Im constantly running out of space no matter what I do I noticed the ringtone assigned to contacts does not work Not a deal breaker Email set up is awkward as I now get two different notifications for the same email and Im not sure how that came to be It seems that whatever software is on there is trying to take over the gmail notifications I am samsung through and through since the beginning and This S7 edge is by far the best samsung phone to date and it has a micro SD card yawll the only thing missing is the beam service and removable battery But I can live with that the battery is pretty good Wireless charging helps too And love the fact that I dont have to worry about the rain its waterproof The gear vr experience oh my God And theres so much more that you can do with it then they share Anybody who gets this device will not be disappointed So what are you waiting for Go get your new edge righto away Im a big fan of Samsung but theyve always had that lag This phone is the fastest yet Highly recommended I never thought that something would actually live up to its hype Everything I read or heard about this device was here I nearly bought an S6 before hearing that the S7 would be the S6 with even better features and that is exactly what I received Thank you for listening Samsung and keep making great products I loved my S4 but ran out of memory So far I like the S7 happy that it has more memory but not happy that 12 of that memory is used up by system files At first I was taken back at its size Same hight but not as wide as numerous Note 3 but as I use it its actually easier to hold and use with one hand
I purchased this phone because otherwise two things the expandable memory sd card and water resistance The more I use it the more I discovered and love The apps edge is awesome One swipe and everything I use the most is instantly available Love the night clock feature and I can swipe to see what notifications have come in without opening the phone
The camera is phenomenal panoramic photos and instant selfies rule
The most amazing thing is the battery life Im on it all day long and still have 40 left when the day is done
This IS THE phone to have without a doubt Very long lasting battery life
Very fast
Sharp and clear images
Fast charging
Phone is very thinfits in pocket easily
I have the s7 edge
You can add apps that you use frequently to the edge of the screenslide your finger across the screen to access themvery handy I really love my new phone I have had an iPhone in the past but it does not compare to the Galaxy S7 as far as I am concerned The back button makes things easy to get to the always on date and time option is awesome and dual screen ability rocks The ability to easily close out of open windows is very cool too Like I said I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Love the new design The curve on the back of the phone has completely changed the ergonimics of the phone Way easier to hold than the S6 Edge that I had So smooth looking and everytime someone looks at the screen they are shocked at how great the screen is I loved the camera on the s6 edge and the S7 edge is equally as good but slightly better in the low light due to the better aperture Cant speak highly enough about the phone and spoke about it so much that two of my friends went out and upgraded to this phone Great job Samsung CaMera takes beautiful pictures The system very snappy and theven resolution is wonderful Love how fast this phone charges I got the latest for battery life it definitely was worth it in my case Heavy user All the extra bells and whistles just made it worth it all the more This is a great phone Has great features Its a beautiful phone to look at and Im really happy ingot it The only thing I wish was better was the price I upgraded from a galaxy s6 and I never thought I would want the edge But after giving it a shot and having it for a while I love the convenience of having the edge tabs and other features such as the expandable memory Fast Display is much clearer and sharper than my old S5 Battery life is good I have had the galaxy s3 s5 s6 and now the s7 I enjoy that Samsung brought back the SD card slot the device is faster runs smoother amazing display sleek design and much more The Galaxy S7 is a step back in the right direction each iteration of this phone gets a little better because Samsung is good at listening to its customers The S5 was a good phone but the cheap construction and the multitude of unnecessary features slowed the phone down The S6 improved the construction of the phone and sped the phone up and introduced stock wireless charging but the phone lost removable memory and became no better than the competing products Now the S7 has a sleek nice build to it it is very fast but still allows removable memory and it reduced some of the useless features while keeping the improved fingerprint scanner and stock wireless charging This phone is a flagship worthy of the name and should make all other companies concerned Oh and the speaker is finally off the back of the phone Im not usually lucky enough to ever have new tech when it first releases You have to have money for that Regardless I decided to get the Galaxy S7 as soon as I heard about it I do not regret that decision at all Im very impressed by all the little details and features packed into this device The camera is amazing and the water resistance is impressive Over all I love this phone and will be hoping to get more great samsung devices soon I bought this phone because I heard from several sources that Galaxy products are more reliable than the competition I also share in this experience because my GS4 was a great phone The phone is sleek and operates flawlessly I love the fact that SD card support and water proof are back Now if a removable battery were also available I dont think that the phone could be better The camera focuses very fast and the pictures I have taken so far have turned out great Overall I am very happy with my purchase

Also just to note I am not someone that cares whether it is unibody or not or whether it is the thinnest device on the market or not Infact I would go the other way if you could double my battery life by making the phone a little thicker I think I could handle that Now I understand that there are advantages to a thinner phone on both the consumer and design side but I think it could be done The overall look over the Galaxy S 7 Edge is what made me want it The look with the egde is really cool feature The only downside that I can note is the screen doesnt have a protector that I have found yet Great screen and camera pretty good battery  overall a very good phone and is great with gear s2 watch amazingly fast phone experience and truly great screen and battery life so far The s7 by far is best phone I have had and I have loved every samsung phone since my s3 It so easy to usethe pictures are bright and crisp better then most cameras I own for my profession this is first phone that is worth the price in my opinion Clear music fast and brilliant quality In the Galaxy line of phones the S7 Edge is my hands down favorite I have been a samsung person for a long time and this is the best galaxy model ever i love it the features edge scree everything is awesome If I had to say something bad itd have to be a little too much bloatware But everything is so outstanding I can hardly fault it on this Gorgeous fast well built device A little slippery to hold but by far the best Galaxy phone thus far I had the S5 for a year or so and loved it When my son broke his phone he inherited my S5 and I upgraded to the S7 Its a sleeker phone than the S5 and much faster The camera was what I didnt like before waiting to load slow to snap photos and the S7 delivers big time The camera loads instantly and photos are crisp Great job Battery life is the best of any smartphone Ive ever had

One thing that I do find annoying is it goes into splitscreen view at the slightest gestures Personally I think its ridiculous to have this functionality in any form factor smaller than a 10 tablet If there were a way to disable splitscreen entirely this phone would get five stars in all categories The phone is just the right size and it is waterproof Upgrading from an s5 this phone is absolutely amazing Every action is lightning fast and the battery performance is ten fold better Best Smart phone Ive ever used The phone itself is easy to use The only issue I have having is when my music was transfered over from my old phone The album I bought and downloaded know phone from goggle play is not in any folder All my other music is but that one is not 
The one issue I do have with it is the new software does not support a online phone game that I have been playing for years Sent my Iphone packing and returned to the S7 Love the design and the return on the extended storage Did not like the removal of the Find My Phone  Overall I have been happy with the S7 Follows suit with all other Samsung devices I have owned Awesome phone I upgraded the galaxy 5 to the new s7 Edge I love it The graphics and picture quality are much improved Overall performance is faster on the device I love the screen and the battery life is excellent 
Disappointed that there is no MHL support have to buy new adaptors etc to cast to TV if dont have a smart tv I love the galaxy S7 The features are great and easy to use The pictures are outstanding as well as the videos Coming from a note 4 I love how this new phone feels in my hand So comfortable Smoothie edges just meant into my hand The edge screen is awesome Fast processed flies through apps Ad card support a plus Huge battery Last allllllllll day This is a very powerful phone with a slick design It takes time to get use to the edge but after a while it works great I was glad to find that they brought back some of key features of the GS5 that I previously had Its fast powerful and it holds a charge all day even though its always running on WIFI and i do not have it in power saving mode I use it regularly through out the day and I also use it a little for work I couldnt be happier This is my 5th galaxy and I will only get Samsung smartphones In fact my whole family has the new s7 I love Samsung I am using Samsung almost 15 years or more I love the Camera Features Performance  Designs and easy Transfer data I never have a problem with Samsung I really enjoy the Galaxy S7 It makes use of multiple features really well included the different swipes hand gestures and other automated commands to make things easy to get to ot accomplish quickly Its also easy to get around the phone when trying to find certain options to turn on and off making it very intuitive So far I love my phone The battery lasts all day The camera is great So many cool features I feel like I havent even scratched the surface of what this phone can do I absolutely love my galaxy S7 I did not know how many new features there were available now Love the new phone upgraded from Galaxy S5 Would highly recommend it to anyone  great battery life fast processing power and an awesome interface Im used to iOS so Im still getting used to Android However I like the field and some of the unique features like pulse and O2 meters I have had my Galaxy S7 for about a week now and have had a chance to play with it enough to know that this is by far the best smartphone out right now My previous phone was a Galaxy S5 and although the jump wasnt as dramatic as I was hoping it would be it definitely has the features and performance to stand out against the competition

The exterior of the phone has a different feel to the S5 due to its metal back The screen also has a smoother feel to it and it seems to curved around the edges which also gives it a unique feel to it The home button no longer has the chrome ring around it which gives it a cleaner all black look I havent had a chance to test how waterproof it really is but at the same time I dont want to test it out But its good to know that if an accident involving water were to happen it should be pretty safe

Samsung has also somehow improved its display since the S5 Samsung is hands down the best at creating a beautiful LED screen and they keep topping themselves When placing the S7 next to my S5 you can see the difference in vibrant colors and brightness The blacks are richer and the colors really pop

As for performance its slightly faster than the S5 Apps that used to load slowly now open up a lot quicker and does not slow down the rest of the phone while in use The true test will come with time and as the phone gets loaded with more background running apps but initial experience is great 

There are some great features on the phone that Im not sure were on the S6 already or not but were not in the S5 Such as the convenience of the headphone jack under the phone now The My Places widget is also great for customizing the settings on phone based on where I am at the moment This is a really great feature to have so I wont have to worry about muting my phone every time I go into work or have to turn on my Bluetooth off This feature allows the S7 to do it on its own based on the wifi it connects to or the location I am in  The Always on Display feature is also convenient for when I am at work and can just leave the phone on my desk and see the time without having to touch my phone

The expandable memory slot is something Im glad did not continue after the S6 That reason alone was the reason I did not have much interest in upgrading from an S5 Fortunately the S7 returns with up to 200GB expandable memory slot and I replaced my old 32GB SD card with a 128GB one

My only real disappointment with the phone is that I was hoping for more dramatic innovations with the S7 compared to my S5 With the exception of the minor noticeable improvements that catch my attention early on it can be easily confused to an S5 

Overall this phone is hard to beat If you are in the market for a new phone this is the only phone that will have everything you need and more The phone runs smoothly its responsive it fills checks off every box for me Its an all around phone Its great for business use personal use and social media Great phone Would highly recommend Size and weight are perfect Ive owned almost all of the galaxy s series phones and also a tabletthis is simply the best so farsamsung is really taking the time to listen to their customers and giving us quality products we want and need Thank you samsung Samsung never fails me Ive had the Galaxy S7 Edge for about 3 weeks now and I love it Premium build Excellent screen Great camera My only complaint about the phone is a software one the screen overlay locks out the ability to change permissions while theyre on Just a small annoyance though during the first few weeks of using the phone Samsung has outdone themselves with this phone Its the sleek design of the S6 with the functionality of the S5 great phone with great features always what I expect from a Samsung product Several week ago I upgraded from my old Galaxy 3 to the s7 and have loved almost every moment of it Yesterday morning I was browsing a website and when I backed out of it my screen went black I tried to power it off and on to no avail I freaked out because I had just bought this phone two weeks ago to the day and it seemed to be no longer functional I havent dropped it gotten it wet or exposed it to anything that could have damaged it Luckily I went to my iPad and did a quick Google search that explained that this happened in the 6s and apparently was happening in the 7s and could usually be solved by hitting the power and the volume down button That did the trick and I scrolled up so it wouldnt factory reset Everything was still there intact I wasnt very happy to have gone through that experience

Other than that everything with the phone has been great It takes great pictures The screen in a nice size the picture looks good sounds good I love the gold color It processes everything so quickly Im very glad that I upgraded to this phone minus that one snafu 

I love how I can customize almost everything how many apps it supports and the battery life is pretty descent I can make it through most of the day without giving it a charge which is refreshing after having such an old phone 

I would recommend this phone to others Ive had every galaxy and almost all new iPhone software and this by far is the best Product performance speed and reliability is overall perfect I love everything about it except the screen scratches very easily Havent dropped the phone but have dropped it in the sink a couple times and no damage Perfect phone for everyone Tech savvy or not This phone is a life saver my daughter threw it in toilet and it survived thank you Samsung for making such a wet proof phone I had the phone for about 3 weeks  I just love it  Ok Google is the best I would recommend this phones to friends anyday The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a solid well built thoughtfully engineered piece of art Its great looking a well as extremely functional Beautiful display and cameras see excellent even in low light or under water The volume buttons and power buttons sit in the right place and are sitting just the right amount out of the phone The phone speaker is loud and clear and the speakerphone is loud enough especially since it only has one but crystal clear even at max volume Much faster
Easier to use
Email management and ease of use Upgrade from S5 I really like the feel and speed of this phone I love the always on feature so I dont need to unlock to see the clock Samsung pay doesnt always work but its a really nice feature Also LOVE the battery life love phone only thing I dont like is the way to put sim and SD card in Love the phone but this is not the phone I wanted  The phone I wanted was the edge but they were sold out Booo Will deal with this phone for NOW I love this phone They brought back the SD card waterresistant bigger battery I had the original Samsung Note Edge and loved that phone too I waited until the S7 came out for the features mentioned above Well worth the wait I have had this phone for almost a month and I like it a lot The only thing I wish was better is the battery This battery doesnt seem to last all day Love this phone Has so many great features I havent 
explored them all Looking forward to doing that This is a new phone and Im still learning all about it But so far I love the features I upgraded from the S5 and the difference is huge I had already expected an excellant phone and I got just that The two things that really stand out are battery life and overall speed The Samsung Galaxy s7 features a sleek and beautiful design that not only attracts attention but is very inspiring to hold in the hand The display is on another level with its beauty although its a bit difficult to see in daylight at low brightnesses indoors the display is stunning And the waterproof is so awesome Ive already dropped my Galaxy s7 in a puddle and all I had to do was wipe it off and continue with my day No worries with this phone This is hands down the best phone I have acquired in my life Im absolutely I love with this phone i have recommended to several friends and relatives to purchase one for themselves which they have and are also enjoying the Samsung experience Keep up the good work This is my first Android phone and so far I absolutely love this phone I recently switched from iPhones which I had since the 3

However I got the S7 Edge and I have to say the Edge drives me insane The colors are amazing its fast its sleek but I am constantly hitting buttons from the edge Because there is now edge really around the phone watching movies sideways you can very easily hit the tracker and jump around in a movie Just holding the sides of the phone will start to hit buttons along the edges of applications Then if you try to hold it from there bottom there are 3 buttons there so the only way to hold the phone really is by the top somehow

I got my wife a case and she loves the phone WAY more now than before I honestly cannot wait for my case to get here so I stop hitting the sides of everything Phone takes amazing photos features are awesome and it is user friendly Ever since getting my first Samsung Galaxy phone Ive never gone back and Ive been everything samsung since theno when it comes to all my electronics That being said the Samsung s7 edge is no disappointment First off the looks The design with the edge is beautiful The graphics are amazing and the size and feel in my hand is perfect The phone is easy to use fast and I havent come across a glitch yet Im upgrading from an s4 so the edge wireless charging and waterproof features are all new to me and they are amazing I will be sticking to samsung forever The phone is fantastic I cant wait to try out the themes We just purchased these phones with my husband and we love it It was a great purchase and love how it takes pictures the quality is the BEST I recently upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S4 I was very happy with the previous phones performance and knew I wanted the latest version I purchased the 7 edge and have been using it for 3 weeks now I am very happy with its speed and capability to take clear pictures which are easily uploaded to social media My contacts and pictures were easily sinced although contacts not saved on the SIM card were not transferred The phone has a lot of usable features and is precise and responsive My only gripe is the fingers easily interfere with the edge touch screen which in turn can make the app think your trying to navigate in the current setting I am going to purchase a different case to see if this helps At times when trying to take pictures the phone can be cumbersome to hold but overall I think Ill be in for the long haul in terms of reliability and memory expansion This phone is horrible My Note3 was a better device The battery does not last long at all Will be returning to store I am blown away once more by Samsung with the new Samsung Galaxy 7 I feel very blessed to be priviliged enough to be able to have this phone for myself Absolutely NO complaints thus farI highly recommend anyone to try this phone out if theyre looking for dependability durability and quality at its best in a cell phone Samsung G935 is just well made overall Looks and Engineering of the Phone is just Superb I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy s5 and I am really enjoying this phoneI am so glad I upgraded since this is a great phone  I love this phone after being a Apple user for over 10 years I switched I am glad i did this phone is Amazing and Verzions service is Amazing Phone is extremely fast almost feels like it knows what youre going to do before you tap anything Screen size is great with the phone not being too wide which seems to keep getting bigger This phone is easier to hold than the galaxy S5 Very happy Samsung owner The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a well design phone Easy to use plus it look great I would continue to use Samsung product because I trust them to work Improved the size and feel over previous versions
Much better camera and picture quality
Overall awesome device This is a great phone I love it They brought everything back it was lacking Its fast The display is super clear it pairs easily to everything battery awesome charges fast and last all day Honestly I dont know what else I could ask for in a phone I am 110 satisfied The phone is great the only issue I have is that I lose LTE service and goes to 3g a loti came from s5 and i never seen it go to 3g I had better service on my S5 maybe it will get better Im still setting up somethings on it Love the phone with the following exceptions

Keyboard is a srep down from the S5

In text messaging cant edit phone s once theyre entered

Verdict is still out on the nonremovable battery I love that it it water resistant I wish it still had the remote But otherwise a great phone Ive had samsung phones before and it never lets you down I tried other companies phones and personally they dont compare to Samsung phones Cant stop showing it off and every body wants one Too bad it mine all mine This phone has a very nice display It is very easy to charge I like that the battery level is always displayed so that you always know how much power is available Numbers and text are easy to read since the phone has a large character display I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends Very fast compared to my g4 and the added features are to die for
Really enjoy the pay feature and has thinned my wallet and that makes me more comfortable on those long trips And the added security on this phone and not carrying all those credit cards is a Hugh plus
Best camera and so much easier to use and added features makes it well worth the purchase price
Although I feel it is a bit over priced Outstandingly amazing performance and glass curved edges feel great in the hand Edge display is unique and stands out Phone is super fast and has no problem running multiple apps at a time While I really wish it kept the IR blaster for my TV from the S5 this S7 is a great replacement for my old phone Its much quicker and the camera is just so much nicer Great phone so far but need a good case screen is very fragle have broke it already but phone works ok with broken screen Im with Lil Wayne and Wesley snipesthis product is far better than the iPhone Within the last three days the phone battery has gotten hot and the battery charge has gone to 10 and 30 with very little use This phone is great lots of options  looks great Samsung has done it again I have both versions  the only plus for the edge is the screen size but I just prefer the larger size My husband and I have one each These are supposed to be unbreakable Well husband drops his phone in the kitchen onto the linoleum floor and has crack Our other were much more durable and didnt have any of the unbreakable features Not at all what they said it was I have had quite a few phones from the m8 m9 g2 g3 I phones 345c66s and alot of others but this s7 is probably my favorite The battery life could be better but I love that it comes with a fast charger Ive used many tech products so to say that this product really impressed me is an understatement

BODY The profile is beautiful The lines are sleek and formfitting allowing your hands trouble free management of your device

SOFTWARE This is not the android that we remember The OS seems more responsive and the layout is always great coming from Samsung 

OVERALL A great product Excited to see what comes next I have to say since switching to Samsung I have been impressed and this model the S7 has been the best yet The phone has great performance and new features but could use some improvements Dont get me wrong it is outstanding But it could have have used so like a similar feature like Apples 3D touch Also the battery euns out very fast when not on power saving mode Great phone overall and I am very happy with it Thank you Overall I love the new S7 with all the new features the only thing I am missing is the ir blaster This phone is Amazing even devoted iPhone users agree At first glance they say it looks like the Galaxy S4 but after using it you can see it on their faces The touch is so smooth Wow its so fast The camera is so clear are just a few of the statements my friends made who are all devoted iPhone users I am personally a Samsung user and this is by far the best Galaxy S on the market My daughter recommended this phone to replace my windows phone She was right My first Samsung phone was the Galaxy S5 and I fell in love with it The features were what I wanted and the battery lasted long enough When I was looking to upgrade I looked at the S6 but was disappointed by the battery life and the lack of an external memory slot so I waited and looked around at other phones When the specs for the S7 were released I knew it sounded like a perfect fit for me The battery lasts longer than both the S5 and S6 and it includes an expandable memory slot like the S5 The camera is also better than the previous versions I absolutely love this phone In order for this phone to be any better it would have to never run out of battery That sums this entire phone up The sheer use of this phone creates an atmosphere of delight and appreciation for this technological revolution we are in currently This phone sums up the impressive imagination of humanity along with the need of ease amongst connectivity of man creating compassion for machine This is my first Samsung Phone and so far Im loving it The only problem was the preinstalled software but its pretty simple to disable anything that it wont let you delete Past that though the phone is great It feels good in myour hand feels responsive and snappy and wow is it pretty I would absolutely recommend this phone to a friend as long as its within their price range I just received this phone last Wednesday and today while I was on the phone having a conversation the phone went completely black Only downside is that its a bit too touch sensitive but that could be because Im used to a phone with a case still on order

Great new features with application management The comments I received mostly has been its very cool looking and stylish My display went out 3 weeks after purchase but over all I have no complaints Way to go samsung Before beginning it is necessary to know that I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 That phone on the V network after upgraded to Lollipop was abysmal suffering from moderate to severe performance issues and the need for frequent cache wiping and resets This was not an isolated issue as the wifes S5 suffered from the same issues just not to the same extent as mine as she is less demanding on a phone It is important to know that the fault with the S5 performance lies more with that V carrier than with Samsung as V refused to push Samsung provided OS upgrades for the bug prone Lollipop version 50

The S7 is on the FAR opposite end of the phone spectrum from the S5 Its construction and design exudes quality and style Performance as far as speed and battery life are also Vastly superior to the S5 With my old phone I could just barely eek out a whole day on a charge where the S7 usually can just go 2 days on a charge Performance 99 of the time is also outstandingly fast

The display is gorgeous as ever just as Samsung is known for The surprise I experienced was just how gorgeous the screen is even when not even lit The way in which the screen bends ever so slightly at the edges together with the almost Black Pearlesque appearance is just amazing

The camera also is just amazing Pictures taken in less than optimum light look far better than the images looked to the naked eye And the double click of the home button is so fast at bringing up the camera app that there will be far fewer missed pictures from this point forward

Only had the phone a couple weeks so far but am loving it so far with only a couple brief performance hiccups experienced Heres hoping that the phones OS will mature and improve although honestly there is LITTLE room for improvement as Samsung introduces updates along the way and that my new carrier which begins with the letter A does a quicker job pushing out any OS upgrades

Thank you Samsung for giving me newfound hope again in Android I bought 4 phones 2 weeks ago and all 4 phones have to have the battery recharged daily the standby time on them is only about 30 hours and if you use them at all you have to charge them after about 16 hours Great phone Size and quality is great Samsung when all out on this device I really love some of the new features Taking a front facing picture with the flash button is awesome I dont like the front facing camera options I dont always use the front facing camera for selfies and the options offered dont work for me 
The battery life is outstanding Im so happy it has a micro SD slot I love the transferring cord Made getting a new phone seamless 
Over all I love my new Galaxy S7 This is my 4th Samsung phone besides all other great products Samsung makes The new S7 is the best of them all and I wonder what new features the S8 will have that the S7 doesnt already has
Great in every aspect
Love Samsung products I love this phone The phone is a perfect size fast and has a excellent camera The design of the phone is really good
Love the apps and the advanced options in this Best phone on the market for 2016 My Samsung S7 Edge is ridiculous its sleek an very stylish There so many different things you can do with it an the camera is absolutely amazing
Excellent phone Samsung Same great performance from the Galaxy series with the bright back sd card reader and improved camera Easy choice of your an android fan I went and upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S7 the day it released I am using it on the Verizon Wireless network and am beyond satisfied with my choice to switch from an G3 Before my G3 I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 and before that I had an Iphone 4 The only reason I switched from Samsung to a G3 is because I like to try different things I have a very open mindset My overall satisfaction with the Samsung Galaxy S7 will assure that I will never again use any other brand smartphone Samsung hands down has the fastest most reliable smartphones on the market I have had this phone for two weeks and I love it The camera is awesome and it has other great features Samsung never disappoints Camera works very well high definition pics and its a nice design and performances very fast The waterproof feature is great and a lot better than my previous s5 And the a great improvement on the design a lot better than the old plastic backs And I still love the expandable space Ive had this phone for a little over 2 weeks It has not disappointed at all It is the perfect size charges quickly and has great battery life much better than my S5 by comparison It is fast and has lots of room for apps I debated between this model and the Edge and I made the right decision for me It has all of the bells and whistles and then some more A great phone but I would like to see even more battery life or allow me to get another battery I love this phone The battery lasts forever takes awesome photos water proof I love my new Samsung S7 The fact that its water proof only makes it that much cooler The only problem Ive noticed is that because of the curved edge screen protectors always appear as if they are peeling up or they actually do peel up but otherwise best phone ever I love everything about my new S7 that is all Everything about it is great Great camera The Device is elegant and immersive 
The Camera was well crafted and designed to give the best picture quality and resolution
Using the Gear VR is an experience I believe everyone should try
The phone itself feels like it was meant to last me for the rest of my life This phone is great The only issue I have is that the battery life is not as good as the S5 had before getting this one Inexpensive great camera and bright screen make this a favorite Cant recommend enough enormous screen in a much smaller footprint Had the s6 Edge Plus before this and this is so much nicer Thumbs up for bringing back the SD card  that was the major drawback of the s6 Fast processor  sturdy glass and excellent makes the Galaxy S7 Edge a strong contender for the best smartphone on the market I keep losing the talk to text feature
Overall excellent upgrade from my three Like everything about it performance fast design style BEST performancelightweight bright displayBuiltin speakers I had just replaced my Note 4 with an s6 Edge when my daughter gave me this S7 I loved the S6 Edge but this phone is excellent It fits well in my hand and I have to admit the size is more convenient than the Edge  I appreciate that it has less bloat ware and that it takes a memory card The performance is robust and the software is less quirky than I would expect with a version one device The battery life has been much better than my Note 4 and the phone stays cooler The sound quality is not what I hoped but I am still tweaking the settings The phone is fast and looks great feel awesome in my hand Had the phone one week now and moved from an S4 to the S7 Love the features and the voice quality and screen However the battery is now what was expected and is disappointing I had the galaxy s5 and I was do for a new phone as well as my wife As a surprise to my wife is got her the s7 as well as myself Wow the speed of this phone is so much better the the 5 The opening g and taking g pictures is so much better Overall I give this hone a 10 The Galaxy S7 edge is the phone of the future Its usefulness is rivaled only by its beauty The curved edges are more than a mere conversation piece they are integral to navigation and notifications The phones battery is superb especially considering the beautiful display and ultra power saving mode and quick charging ensure the phone is always available when you need it The slim form factor and curved edges on both faces make the phone fit just right into your hand This phone is a work of masterful engineering and design and the best phone that Samsung or any other smartphone manufacturer has produced to date With carriers financing plans the phone is totally affordable I love this phone Upgraded from the S5 I have found it to be faster in every way
Apps respond rapidly The camera is as fast as I could imagine Just a double click on the home button and the camera comes up instantly Photos are instant as well no waiting to focus again after pressing the capture button as I found was so slow with the S5
The thing I really like is samsung pay and the ability to use it at almost any credit card reader So far the only place I have found it wont work is 711 stores for some reason 
The phone is sleek with the glass front and back Feels great and easy to use I have gone through the S4 and the S5 and now having the S7 as a phone is a great satisfying product as it is The camera is amazing and the design is just stunning It is light and easy to handle The theme store is also quite a big plus to the phone it adds a lot of color and personality to the phone I also love how Samsung provided a display when the phone is turned off that way you dont have to turn on your phone to check the date or time It is very convenient If you are looking for a high quality smart phone I definitely recommend this phone I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 I have had android and iPhone and Ill tell you the Galaxy is by far the best I have owned It is fast and reliable Well it was a little slow at first responding problem calling out had to spend 2 hrs on the phone with verison to fix it s7 way better I think then than galaxy s7 edge fits in the hand better and just a better cell great new cell This is definitely the best phone you can buy right now The camera is outstanding its very fast and the build is as close to perfection as you can get The only real downside is a hugely excessive load of carrier bloat comes pre installed and with a locked bootloader there is no way to truly unlock the potential of this device This product is better and faster then the S6 Edge I had before getting this one The side are smoother then the S6 and I feel like it faster when Im playing games The only con I have noticed is infrequent restart of the phone if some active app hangs on or freezes And when the phone restarts finger scan doesnot work one has to still punch in the pin number
This has been little annoying
Hope the bug will be fixed
All other features awesome
I am enjoying the phone to the max As I was informed by Samsung that they wouldnt post my review as it states the actual price At almost XXX I will use the following verbage 
As this phone costs WAAAAAAY TOO MUCH MONEY I consider this one pricey phone However it does pack quite a punch
It has all of the features of my previous G4 Active and then some I like its slimmer feel and the new screen is very nice
I hope this is more acceptable Samsung I like the photo event video collage option
also enjoy the additional edge options
plus the dim light camera is great
finally the option of adding SD card is the best part Bought this phone a week ago after I dropped the S5 Ive had for two years in soup I love the phone so far and all the new features theyve added since the 5 The only thing I dont like so far is I had to use Ultra power saving mode yesterday and the message app kept glitching out and blacking out the screen  my brothers s7 did the same thing today The Battery life is incredible the responsiveness is so fast the octocore is too good to be true Samsung has done it again and made another yet great product The camera is just as good as my Canon T3i I love the motion capture as well as the burst shots it gives you the ability to choose the best photo If I were to take a shot at the new G5 or the S7 I would take the S7 in a heartbeat One more thing to finalize this review is that Im so happy you brought back the replaceable SD card that feature was the best overall Love the camera Great pictures Some nice edit feature included for your pictures Stablizer with zoom is a wonderful feature Very easy to use  is just overall a great phone to use I had an S4 before I got this one and I expected it to have all new stuff but the things on here are really cool and helpful Upgraded from a Note 4 the S7 is a little smaller and lighter but the features seem to be a lot easier to figure out Also liked the email to show and help understand all the features this phone has to offer Im a person that will not upgrade a phone until I absolutely have no choice For the past 3 12 years I had a Galaxy S 3 and reluctantly started using my moms old S4 late last year I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy S7 Edge and I think it was the best phone decision Ive ever made The smoothness of the design makes it worth the switch by itself However thats not all The speed of the phone blows all the other phones out of the water and the space available on the phone allows me to actually keep all the apps I use on it without constantly adding the app then deleting it until I need it It is definitely worth getting the S7 Edge I have been a fan of samsung devices for many years now I have recently tried other manufacturers devices but really did not like how they felt and how slow and clunky the UI felt Touchwiz on this device is flawless and smooth Great feel to the phone and i have a lot of people asking to feel and experience it for themselves Great product It is a really great smartphone with a lot of great new features i will recommend this phone to all my friends and family I wet this phone all the time and nothing has happen to it I love the display and performance This phone is absolutely the beat that it has ever gotten Download music on your S7 and wonder where they went Go to Google play store and download the Samsung music app after that boom there is your music The app takes it from your file manager and puts it in your newly download app If you have the cloud on your computer dont run it the same time ur cloud is running on ur phone Because what ever you download on ur computer will appear in ur cloud and use up all ur space Log out of ur cloud when using ur computer There are so many great things about this phone you just have to play with it its an amazing phone works amazing met my expectations Before buying this Galaxy S7 I was using an old Galaxy S4 so it was quite a jump in technology Faster operating system bugger screen better battery life and still with expandable memory Purchasing the Galaxy S7 is the right move if you want a phone that is an all around a great deal I upgraded from the galaxy s5 This phone is way faster Expandable memory is also a must Amazing phone overall and amazing battery life The screen is bright and clear Fingerprint scanner is a huge improvement from the S5 Camera is awesome and takes great photos Themes are new and fun to switch up Love this phone so far Its an awesome phone epic features Samsung is an awesome company Have been buying galaxy phones since the original Every time them make upgrades that in my opinion make it worth it I am upgrading from a Galaxy S5 Active so I missed all the trouble with the SD card being taken away

The upgrades that are obvious from the get go  Better camera faster processing more RAM memory the ability to wireless charge the phone 

The only real complaint I have about these phones are the price tag but since I use mine every day I guess I can get over it Ive had my edge for about 2 weeks now I traded in my note 5 for it I love everything about it Not much different than edge 6 that my husband has Only reason I gave 4 for performance is because if brightness is up and you are an all day phone person like me your battery drains That said the battery still lasts me through the work day I love all the new features on the new phone especially the better photo quality and love the fact that they have made it water proof Im sold on Samsung period My last phone was an s4 Before that I had a nexus prime I really enjoyed using these devices and didnt really want to upgrade from the s4 I was afraid Id be disappointed But wow The s7 is amazingly smooth Easy to handle Love the design

Lovery everything about my s7 Love the sleek design Great features Easy to use I love the Samsung Galaxy S7 before I had an iPhone 5c and the difference between phones is amazing the camera on the Galaxy S7 is incredible the picture quality is the best feature I feel like this phone is easier to use than an apple I love everything about it My wife and I are avid Samsung fans 

Phones tablets TVs even our kitchen appliances 

We had the S5 and were happy with that but the s7 is even more impressive 

Camera is super sharp and quick and has loads of cool modes

Performance is very quick menus intuitive

Charge and charging are awesome now too

We took advantage of the preorder GearVR promo and should be receiving those shortly so will have even more to explore and experience 

Looking forward to the Gear360 camera coming out so we can make our own VR videos Design is incredible almost dont want to put a case on it Its also super fast and the extra storage is what sets it apart As said in the title I love the camera and screen The display is great I have never seen a phone this well with camera features and display The sound is good too Another cool thing I can get it wet and it wont be wrecked This phone is great Its smooth  beautiful I enjoy it so much Im happy I got it There is so much to say about this phone Very user friendly and battery life is great Im still learning the phone so I will provide feedback later The phone gets hot really fast when using it Other then that no problems Email is missing the following No Outbox No Spam No Junk No Cell Back No Option to build Subfolders to Save emails No Circle with arrow to click to speed up moving emails from Server to Cell No Text Message option An App is required to transfer photos from Cell to Laptop  cables will no longer work Refers you to an app for WiFi transfer  not what I wanted Phone is just as advertised Does everything better Longer battery life faster great pictures and waterproof Voice commands work fast and efficiently This phone rocks Im still discovering the numerous features and enjoying every one Satisfied with the product The touch sensitivity learns your touch within the first few texts you send Bluetooth and wifi connection works great offering a smooth and reliable connection Features on the phone are great I really love the new drop down text window that allows you to send a quick response to a text with having to stop what your doing Works great for games or movies cause you dont have to stop and reload them Battery lasts all day on a single charge At the moment I never go below 50 Im sure as the battery wears it will change Im not a fan of you not being able to replace the battery as I usually wear them out within a couple years with a phone Processor is something to not The phone stays cool and runs smooth no matter how many apps I have running And new multi window functions are great Great phone Nothing much new coming from my previous galaxy s4 but I did notice once I got my S7 and turned it on I was shocked to find out there was no default app for the amazing music player that was featured in all of the previous phones That being the phone is still great battery is amazing and theres even an option for you to make your phone charger fast however doing this may make your phone over heat I didnt notice I had it turned on for the first week Good phone with even better features I would have given it 5 stars if I could video chat with others I like the way my contacts have their first initial in a medallion for easy searches They could find a much better way of doing screen captures its way too complicated now It should have come in white gold or black maybe navy A wider color selection wouldnt make me feel like I settled on the phone I have now because the color I really wanted wasnt available Also the ability to pull in email text to a calendar update instead of creating it manually Let me start by saying Im a huge Android fan About 6 months ago I changed to an iPhone because Im a tech fan above all else and wanted to see what the fuss was about I like an iPhone a lot I think they did a lot right Then I had a chance to get the S7 in my hand and I literally didnt put it down Having such a compact body and big screen is above all else the reason Im sticking around The camera has been reported a million times as the best on the planet so I wont talk too much about that but it is ridiculous I think for the first time in Touchwizs existence it actually enhances the Android experience Theres some really common sense stuff going on in the UI that is appreciated Theres still some weird nuances like when you sort your app drawer alphabetically it thinks you may change your mind for the next app you install so it doesnt alphabetize new apps really and SamsungAndroid really need to develop an iMessageFaceTime competitor I travel a lot internationally and its nice to send iMessages over WiFi with no charges Anyway I digress Great phone great balance Great option to have to chat with family and friends and not having to go to another app to video chat with Great option to have the video chat option available on the galaxy 7 This phone has been wonderful It has a beautiful screen and camera I switched to the Samsung from an iPhone because of the expandable memory The s7 edge is a phone that feels great looks great and has the power to makes think you have the premier phone in the market Ive really enjoyed this wonderful display processor is fast large memory capacity waterproof really nice camera theres such much this phone can do The only thing Im not to happy about is that it has an internal battery In the long run this could be an issue as I normally keep my phones 2 yrs So far it has been pretty good cause the charge last about 12hrs nonstop with me watching movies listening to music playing games checking emails Well first thing to say is you got to love android operating systems to really enjoy this product Found the picture quality is by far better than any other Android phone I have used The only item I dislike is the ads that do appear other than that this phone is superb to all others GREAT PURCHASE The most beautiful and powerful phone I have ever came in contact with Very responsive and stylish Picture results are the best part of this phone Ive had a samsung tablet and when it was time to switch up phones I wanted to stick with something I knew but its exceeded my expectations so far I really love all the new features Never had a problem with my iPhone 5 running out of battery by the end of the day The S7 loses its charge very quickly despite promoting the phone as having increased battery life and some builtin batterysaving features The display brightness changes to where you cant hardly see the screen when in auto The lock button is in a bad position on the right side of the phone and is always getting pushed accidentally Camera is ok but nothing special I really like the expanded memory All in all the S7 fast and does the job This is the best phone I have ever owned I switched over from iPhone to samsung s5 a few years ago and havent looked back since I did not go to the s6 due to not being able to add my own memory card I was looking at other companies but Im glad I waited and purchased the s7 edge on the date that it came out I absolutely recommend this phone to anyone This phone has a great processor and is very fast The camera is the absolute best out there It takes amazing pictures even in low light Ok so I really really love this phone I had a Droid Mini and it was a few years old  it was time to upgrade Took some getting used to but this phone is just completely radical The color of the phone is beautiful sounds are crispy and clear pictures are bright and realistic watching videos are soooo smooth with a ridiculously high definition display The ONLY issue I have had is that the battery goes FAST I bought this phone when it became avaliable for preorder and I have absolutely love it I believe the Samsung Galaxy Series is the best Android phone out there I love that they listened to the public and bought back the SD card slot with the ability to have up to 200GB of additional space I am also amazed with the camera especially since they went down in pixels from the S6 The speed of the phone is excellent as is the battery life and the ability for the phone to keep cool to the touch with new cooling core they used I especially love that they were able to do all this while keeping the cool sleek design of the S6 I definitely recommend this phone A all the way I loved my Samsung S5 There was nothing wrong with ituntil I saw the Samsung S7edge Although bigger than the s5 it is so thin and light you dont notice the size The edge feature is just amazing Everything right at your finger swipe The camera and its features are about 10 steps beyond my trusty S5 Samsung phones just keep getting better and better This is a performance driven phone it delivers in every area I just purchased this phone and love it I had been using an iPhone 6 plus since it first came out After b switching to the s7 I feel as if the straight jacket apple had me wearing was taken off No more restrictions I dont have to worry about my phone getting wet which just happened to my daughters iPhone 6 The screen is amazing on the s7 and the low light camera and picture quality in general blows the iPhone away I soooo love my Galaxy 7 edge Samsung once again really out did themselves Features of this phone are so very helpful and wonderful to work with I once owned the note4 Im glad I waited to upgrade I love the ability to use the tools on the side Gives me easier access to my apps And news from yahoo There are just so much new features that I am surprised at its simplicity so easy to understand Been really happy with Samsung that I cant see myself switching to a different brand Only one complaint  the case has nothing that makes the phone easy or even possible to hang on to It has a glass like finish on all six sides making the phone easy to drop It will slip out of a pocket slip from your hand slip from any slightly sloped surface

When getting a protective case make sure you get a rigid hard shell case If you put a thin flexible case on it a drop from 3 feet on to a carpeted surface will break the screen With a rigid protective case it is bigger bulkier and heavier than the Galaxy S5

I know nine people with the S7 and five have a broken screen on their two week old phone Has great featureslooks greatis fast and is a investment If Im using WiFi I have to turn Bluetooth off If Bluetooth is on it will show youre connected to the WiFi network but it will not load anything I took my phone to the store and the Samsung Representative happened to be in the store He checked all of the settings and said it should work It doesnt It would be nice if Samsung could send an update to resolve this Its aggravating to have to turn Bluetooth off everytime I want to use WiFi and rember to turn it back on so it can communicate with my car Other than that I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge I like the slim design for it not that hard to work with it I love everything about this phone from the size style and features Its so cool that it will even send a reply text out automatically  if I choose to do so while Im driving that lets the person texting me that Im driving right nowIll get back to ypu later
The phone has so many feature that my previous Galaxy Note 3 seems obsolete
I was happy with my old phone but am elated with this one Its a beauty and I Love It  This is a great phone with great features The screen resolution is clear and bright The battery life lasts all day for me Its the best Samsung I have seen The galaxy phones are some of the more expensive phones on the market but are well worth the cost They are fast reliable and the cameras are great I have had my Samsung S7 for about 3 weeks and absolutely love it The screen display is bright and beautiful its also very easy to use the phone is great but the bloatware is too much they need a clean os for future devices Love this phone Very big fan of Samsung products Love the features and style of phone Ive owned the SG S4 SG S5 and now the S7 Havent been let down so far so I recommend to all Absolutely Fantastic Best Smartphone on the market by far I really like this phone so far The camera is amazing and the  Phone is pretty easy to figure out In the past four years Ive been using Samsungs phones only and now that the Galaxy S7 edge arrives it came with all the perfections posibles When I take it with me to every roadtrip is like being with a friend because it have all the things I like and knows me better than anyone Its camera is the best and it helps me capture the best moments and memories of my adventures Having a S7 edge is like making your life better I have own d the S4 and recently the S5 By far this is the best of all of them I use my phone for my business and I still cant believe how long the battery lasts I use it 8 to 10 hours a day and still charge it every other day The display is sharp and crisp as well as easy to read I have already this to several of my associates and family The phone gets better and better as I play around with it The camera has me taken away with professional looking photos that are almost to good to be true I definitely recommend this phone Everything about it is outstanding I was accustomed to the S5 and the S7 is a good improvement although there are some features I miss from the S5 Love the design and efficiency Brilliant display and astonishingly fast The Gear VR that came with the phone is fun to play with What else needs to be said other than what do you expect Its a galaxy Awesome phone Great job again Samsung Compared to other smart phones this is currently my top pick The interface and response is fantastic I got this phone right before going on vacation and could not have asked for a better camera on a phone Taking group shots was amazing Phone features are similar to galaxy 5 but all the new features make this an ideal phone Looks great Feels like it actually has some weight to it Its waterproof etc It has a new feature called always on displayit can be distracting sometimes Worth getting Good step up from previous models In love with galaxy always Samsung Galaxy for life I have been very happy with my S7 The camera is great And everything has worked to my expectations Love device and extra battery life Also love the ability to upgrade every year I have had almost every galaxy this on out performs all of them by far I am really happy the micro SD coming back the display is beautiful I have NOT experience any glitches The design is outstanding and the size is perfect My only draw back is price I bought one for myself and my teenage daughter She absolutely loves her phone The camera is the best feature It takes absolutely gorgeous pictures Happy except it wont recognize pair with or connect to Bluetooth devices Disappointed Bought it last month came with the free VR headset Pretty cool Within a month already needed to have a system update and like all updates you dont notice any positive outcomes but you will notice the negative side effects Cant copy gif files to clipboard anymore Also when i listen to misic through bluetooth it cuts in and out ONLY AFTER THE UPDATE THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM Im not a fan of Samsungs updates Coming from the S5 where they did an update that KILLED battery life Im not looking forward to 2 more years of this garbage Phone is nice but if you care about data usage dont get it There is no way to restrict data usage on specific apps when you dont have a wifi hook up The older phones have a restriction available for each app This OS does not offer that as confirmed by Samsung and Verizon support I wonder who decided on that one To be the best of the best you have to be better than the rest this phone is just that This phone has a lot of great features and is pretty easy to use it just love it This is my first galaxy and I must say I love it Beautiful design great features by far the best android phone I have used to date A few minor glitches that I hope Samsung and app developers will get figured out but all in all excellent device Only wish Samsung used the exynos chipset in the US Benchmarks show better performance in the early going Really like the performance and quality of this phone I am so in love with this phone It have a lot of great features and it is faster thatn my old phone I came from an IPhone 6S Plus to the Galaxy s7 Edge and this thing demolishes the IPhone in every perspective 
The features are still surprising me and I picked this phone up the morning of launch day 
Love my S7 Edge I just took my daughters prom pictures with this phone and I think my pictures turned out better than the professional photographers did This phone is amazing with the water resistant and the SD card slot for more memory expansion and the attractive silver color is a keeperjust superb This has been by far the best phone I have had Been with the galaxy family for years but this is the best one This is honestly the best galaxy I have owned yet beautiful screen blazing fast performance I have not had the battery go below 40 percent yet last all day It feels great in the hand to and of course throwing the SD capability and water resistance was the best move Samsung could have made I LOVE THIS PHONE I used to have an iphone before this and I can definitely tell you that this phone is better in so many ways My main concern before I bought this phone was the battery life With my iphone I would carry a charger with me everywhere to keep charging my phone I can Proudly say that the Samsung Galaxy S7 would last me from the morning till late at night without a single charge I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great phone ONLY ISSUES IS THAT I FIND IT TOO BIG This is my first Android and I was a bit intimidated but the S7 made it easy I upgraded from the S3 and I am very pleasantly happy with the new phone Definitely worth the upgrade I love this phone Everything has been so easy The camera is super Definitely recommend this phone This phone is great my only complaint or wish was that when you select always on display that the edge screen would stay on instead of the main screen love Samsung products  been buying samsung for last 12 yrs never had any complain Great features on Samsung galaxyS7Edge  especialy water proof scatch proof fits in your hand easy tomanuver with on hand love this product This product has GREAT FEATURES Ever since I came across Samsung Galaxy S1 I fell in love with all SAMSUNG products  never had any problems I love all their features  continue to recommend it to friends  family This is by far the best smartphone I have ever owned I had the m7 when it first came out and then the Galaxy S6 edge last year and this S7 edge blows them away Great battery life smooth as butter and all the memory Ill ever need with the additional storage My wife choose the S7 over the lastest IPhone and could not be happier If your in the market for a top of the line smartphone you have to check it out The Samsung S7 Edge is a phone that hasdoes it all From the camera to split screening everything works and it does so smoothly I still continue to find new features that make this phone even greater This is the best phone I have ever used I love the phone and updated features It is very easy to navigate It is light The edge screen is really nice I recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade The camera is awesome I love the smoothness of the operation Takes great pictures I like the fact that its waterproof  has an expandable memory slot The phone is nice and sleek but I think it is a little too big and the buttons are in slightly odd places When I place it down I frequently hit a button on accident The battery life is not much better than previous Samsung models I wish the battery technology would evolve However I am enjoying this phone Ive previously had other makes Not sure about value as all cell phones seem expensive to me Still learning about some of the features but havent had any problems with service so far I dont normally get the latest version as I feel new SW always has some kinks that need to be worked out There isnt much to say about this phone besides awesome The phone is a beast It can handle anything you throw at it and then some The display on the phone is also amazing The edge screen gives it the effect that its bezel free The call quality is what you would expect for a phone in 2016 The camera on this thing is also amazing Dont let the 12mp camera scare you away It takes beautiful pictures The front facing camera also had a wide angle lens and takes great selfie pictures I was very glad the s7 went back to a mini memory card The s6 didnt have this I got the Edge and Im happy with it not Holy cow happy Its very fast and the conversion was easy enough from the s5 The camera is very good and takes great videos I wish the battery was able to come out I have loves all samsung products for years and I buy this brand in TV in fridge in stove in laptop in tablet and smart watches all the best always keep up the awesome Job in innovation and great products I just upgraded from my old phone and am amazed at how great this phone is The screen is clear and easy to read the phone is simple to navigate and the camera quality is beyond my expectations Took some outdoor pictures and the color contrasts and resolution blows away my old phone A great purchase This is by far the best phone I have ever owned It is so feature rich you have to experience it to believe it The design is flawless the glass back is beautiful the edges and front are flawless Samsung has gotten in right with this phone expandable storagealong with ample internal storage excellent camera flawless pictures and video you just cant say enough about it you have to see it yourself I started out not being an android person but this phone has converted me This is so easy to used so fast and the camera is fantastic The features are too many to name I love it and recommend to anyone I can I love the Edge S7 on the whole just wish I had waited to see if it was going to come out in a plus size I went from the Note 4 to the Edge S7 I thought there wouldnt be that much of a difference in the size but after a couple of weeks with the phone I still miss the little bit of screen size I gave up I am enjoying all the additional features that are on this phone versus my old one This product is smooth fast goid color I would recommend this product I went from the Note Edge to the S7 Edge and it was the perfect move It fits so much better in my hands and the battery life is much improved HAS everything one needs on their cell phone plus super fast and such a great phone everyone should buy one I love the phone over all However the screen is too small for a big guy like myself Texting in cumbersome for me thus the lack of a Smart Pink is missed Missing my Note 3
 Also not sure if I can or if theres a need to stop background running apps Galaxy S7 Edge is one of the best phones Ive ever used Very speedy and very fast One of the things I love about it the most is the battery life Ive owned the phone since debut and Ive never seen it below 30 yet Its amazing 

The camera is also superb and I am now the designated dark room photographer 

In a nutshell itll take a lot from Samsung to make me want to upgrade away from this phone I will probably be able to hold out until the GS10  No worries anymore about battery life and response This is world class upgrade for me from the S4 Charging times are tops 15 hours to full charge NO idea how they did it but its great I love the edge features thought it was a gimmick but i love it easy and fast to call my people and call up frequently used features

Now I am one of those people looking at their phone all the time The only issue I have with this phone is that I cant update my apps using wifi unless it is after 9pm Then the apps will update with no problem Top header to small have a hard time pulling the menu down I have just recently purchased the S7 Although the style of the phone is not much different from the S5 i do like the newer camera and security features What i am not happy with is the sensitivity of the screen With the S5 you had an option to adjust the sensitivity such as if you wore gloves which i do need to do with my job This phone does not give the option and i also found even with out gloves on I and other people that i have talked to have a problem as well with the screen  not hitting the proper keys on the key board the intial swipe and getting apps to start I do hope that there will be an update for this It is just annoying to me that i wished i never upgraded I stick to the Samsungs Androids over the IPhone for many reasons I would hate to be pushed back to them Love my new S7 edge Love all the features and love using the new Marshmallow So far so good I love the battery life Important for me since I listen to my music all night at work Signal not as strong as I would like it to be sonetimes Low light camera water resistant and almost waterproof sleek design bright vivid display micro sd card usage good internal memory as well neat interface and features Front and back facing cameras are both high quality The images are clear I just got my cell on Mar 08 2016 and have been having issues with my Galaxy S7 freezing when I take pictures or view pictures on gallery My phone resets it self every time I view pics or take a couple of pics 

I get message gallery isnt responding
Do you want to close it waitok

very annoying when trying to take pics of special eventsNo one at my carrier store knows what can be the issue  I love love love my gs7 I love everything about the phone has awesome features love everything about the camera features its like no other camera for smart phones I love the fact thats its water proof so no worries about getting my phone wet I would highly recommend the gs7 to my friends and family its way better then the iPhones  I had a Galaxy 4 for about 2 years and thought I would never give it up until I looked at the Galaxy 7 great builtin camera great looking strong screen and it is water resistance unlike the 5 and the 6 this one has expandable memory i like it so much i got four s7 it is very good looking great product Samsung S7 Edge is wonderful Generations ago I fell in love with the photo capabilites and the more I get the opportunity to exercise it the more I love it Though I mostly use it for work due to its android platform and interconnectability with my corporate needs I yearn for time to play with it Brings out the big kid in me once I find a new feature its capabile of I believe Im hooked for life I am a believer I love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 I have been hooked on the Galaxies since my first one And they just keep getting better and better This phone is sleek and slim the screen is bright flawless and the perfect size
It takes beautiful crisp clear detailed photos quickly and flawlessly
I love the way you can split the screens and view more than one page at a time 
Being able to open calendar and contacts while on a phone call is also a major Plus I am a very proud owner of the new Samsung Galaxy s7 edge I traded my Note 4 almost immediate as soon as it came out 
Ive done extensive research about the phone prior to purchasing and it definitely lived up to its expectations

Ill make this concise and straight to the point 

Design Spectacular Its a fingerprint magnet and very slick I highly recommend getting a low profile case However the design is just perfect to the hands and it looks simply outstanding Its like holding a bar of gold 

Performance FAST This phone definitely is the fastest phone I ever had  faster than the stock Android nexus 6p The cameras boot time shutter and capture has very little to no lag
The camera The already perfect camera that the note 5 sported just got better Its the best camera phone in the market period 
The battery Im blown away with the battery life The 3600mAh juice is no joke It lasted me from 8am to past midnight when I took it to chicago  and thats with heavy usage I took about 200 pictures that day videos several phone calls navigated the entire downtown while walking and a LOT of text messages and I was left with 20 to play with when I got back to the hotel Thats at least 3x more than my note 4s battery life 

Features The edge screen features is what separates the series to any other smartphones out there Although not completely supported and developed by many other apps its very accessible and convenient to use 

Value not cheap This is the only category that I didnt rate 5 stars I believe its priced too high In the end I didnt mind paying high dollar for an outstanding phone but 

Id definitely recommend it to all my friends The best smartphone I ever owned Phone is great I came from the not 5 when switched carriers and the edges had the extra features I wanted with the SD card and water resistants Only thing so far I havent liked is that the screen scratched when the same abuse on my note 5 never did I have upgraded to the S7 from an S4 so naturally the performance boost is instantly noticeable I love everything about the phone from the beautiful pictures it takes to the sleek appearance Super plus for the phone being splash proof I skipped out on the S6 because of the lack of memory expansion and I am happy to say it was brought back with the S7 Battery life is pretty good after disabling several functions I didnt need Just like the S4 the location services is a power hog so I just turn it on when I need it Overall a very good phone If I get the life out of this one that I did out of my S4 Ill be quite satisfied 

My only criticisms so far are that the hold button for the phone is located right at ear level and I have placed calls on hold just by putting it up to my ear The only other thing is that just like every other phone out there it is very slippery out of the box A protective case with a good grip is a necessity Was ready for an upgrade from one of the fruit phones a Samsung rep was in store and showed everything this high tech wonder can do and I was sold The cameras are amazing front and back battery life is better than average and the features lots of features are all outstanding performers Theres been an adjustment period for me but Im getting the hang of the Android OS its also pretty intuitive All in all Im pretty darn happy I jumped ship to Android and the Galaxy in particular Love the screen clarity and ease of use The new size fits well in my hand Great new product I really enjoy my Galaxys since day one Ive been finding more and more reasons to keep picking my phone up The camera is phenomenal and the battery lasts all day thanks Samsung for making my retinas bleed and making me smile doing it Just get this phone words are cheap OMG this is the best phone is ever use I am happy by using this product because the Samsung company make many improvements and I hope this company make more improvements in their future products
The feature I like most is the edge system the GS7 Edge is my first Edge but my 3rd consecutive Galaxy phone beginning with 5 I believe they are truly exceptional products I also have the most recent Galaxy Tablet also having the same wonderful experience This is by far the best phone Ive ever owned I havent found anything at all I dont like about the phone Very sleek and user friendly I love my new phone I was weary about changing to a larger phone from my 2nd gen Moto X I researched several phones and read and watched several reviews I thought I wanted the S7 but after reading reviews and seeing the screen edge with the features and knowing that it had a larger battery I chose the S7 Edge
 I was not disappointed Im still getting used to the phone I occasionally have trouble with one handed operation but they have a couple fixes for that You can have the keyboard shift to one side or other andor resize the whole screen to about a fourth of the size in one corner It is odd but useful and easily accessed through quick button clicks on the home button
There are many great features including a much wanted return of added memory via the micro SD card slot a great camera and more but honestly I just wanted a powerful and long lasting phone I see all the features including the water proof rating as great bonuses I this product is awesome I find my self spending more and more time everyday doing more on this phone than before Excellent phone  Excellent build quality runs fast has fingerprint ID and great camera Personally I would have liked the more modern USB connector but agree wSamsung that the market is not yet ready for what that USB connector has to offer Earphones and voice calling work well too This is my 2nd android phone and 1st Samsung phone Absolutely love it The curved edges and features are awesome Its fast reliable and does what a phone should I was tempted to buy an iphone because of its security but with the s7 I get frequent updates directly from samsung I bought the phone about a week ago and everything works great except the battery Before I had the s5 and that battery lasted longer than this one I do love the screen shot feature and how you can transfer the info from your previous phone with just connecting the cable Incredible Phone Looks are fantastic function is second to none Its very very Fast open multiple programs doesnt phase it a bit Battery last longer than day while using consistently all day Size is perfect for for any function you are doing phone is very comfortable holding against ear speaker is one of best have heard in quite sometime Would love to go on but can only appreciate what everyone is saying is to actually pick one up and put through its paces and you will be IMPRESSED Be prepared to take one with you after the experienceGREAT JOB SAMSUNG I love my new S7 The camera is the best can take a ton of different types of pictures Love the 3d feature Having wet hands and using my phone is no longer a problem  This Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone works great and its easy to use I have been a Windows phone user since they came out I saw the previews for the S7 edge and I thought it might be time to make a switch to Android and Samsung I am so glad I did This phone does everything I need and want It meets my personal and professional needs It is lightning fast and crystal clear It is the best phone I have ever had I will never purchase another type of phone I will simply upgrade when the time comes Thank you Samsung I am definitely loving my new phone it had a great design perfect size for my hand The display is incredibless Its all around just a wonderful addition to the Galaxy family This product is enhanced with great camera quality nevertheless the water proof features is the best thing yet It has an excellent camera the beast of a battery the expandable storage and the seductive design that is completely out of the world I would buy this phone any day of the year thats how much i love this phone This phone is my current work phone and I have to say I lucked out in getting this The first thing you notice about this phone is how amazing the screen looks The S7 Edge has the best screen on any mobile device no question about it Im still getting use to Android as an OS but overall Im loving this phone Get yourself a GearVR headset and call it a day This phone is fast and beautiful I love this thing Everything is great about this phone except for a few things 1 It seems to overheat fast I did find stuff online to prevent this but figured I should not have to 
2 Not many accessories for the galaxy s7 edge to date As an iPhone user for the past five years I am still learning how to use everything The new layout is comparable to the iPhone with just a few more functions Overall a pretty good phone if we can still call them that I hope this technology get better every year Samsung 7 and other samsung product So many more features and power than my Galaxy S5 Very happy to have the ability to use a Micro SD memory card So far so good Just love it Performance has been very very good There is not much change from the s6 I love the water proof feature As far as performance it is a little better and cudos for the expandable memory I have had this phone for 3 weeks now and absolutely love it Its sleek and performance driven My battery lasts all day long and I am constantly using it for apps games email web surfing listening to music etc This is the phone youve been waiting for  so far my expectations have been exceeded I would recommend this phone to everyone I had all my family get one I had about over 300 of my family and friends get the galaxy s7 edge I went from the S5 to the S7 Edge I found this phone to be lighter and thinner The screen looks amazing very clear and bright I found the phone to be easy to use since I was already familiar with the S5 My only minor complaint is with the curved display I dont find that it really adds much to the phone You can display a sports ticker or stock quotes but it just does not feel like a feature I will use a lot I personally did not like that always on display either The phone constantly displays a clock even when it is locked However you can disable this if you choose The battery life seems really good I generally can go 1 12 to 2 days between charges Overall I am very happy with the phone But if you are torn between the S7 and the S7 edge in my personal opinion I would just get the S7 as I dont feel the curved screen adds much to the phone It also makes it hard to get a screen protector that fits and stays on properly if you like to use them Great phone love it Some bugs but Im sure they Wii go away The features on this phone are absolutely fantastic the S7 has amazing Clarity when it comes to taking photos videos and sharing capabilities The phone call Clarity is absolutely amazing the video chat is simple to use all the features are relatively easy to manage and the entire phone itself is sound stable and fantastic it does not overheat it is durable and it is the best phone that they have out there available Coming from an S6 Edge this is a much better phone in all aspects The battery is so much better and I go a whole day now without a charge It is screaming fast and the interface is well laid out What I do not like is the limitation of 32gb I have an SD to hold photos and music but the small internal ram limits my app space Other than that pretty nice Feels great in my hand and has all the features I need and then some  and then some I havent even discovered yet Couple of things though I havent been able to figure out how to paste contact imageslinks onto the home page s  and I havent been able to figure out how to play all my music like I could on my S4 Otherwise love the phone I upgraded from the 6 to the 7 I have finally had a chance to take low light photos I was told that this is where this phone has shown improvement over the 6 and they were not kidding The photos the 7 takes are amazing Best phone ever I love that it shows me my messages and time without wasting battery Coming from the GS5 this phone is amazing The features are very intuitive and the new uses for the edge screen really bring everything together Gaming is phenomenal There is a bit of sluggishness if you get a lot of notifications or try to do some things too quickly Overall the phone does what I want it to acts as a great tool and meets my high gaming demands Very happy with my purchase The new Samsung has excellent features and better video and camera qualities This is the best phone Ive ever used from camera all the way to the speed highly recommend anyone try it out This phone is compact and fast I loved my previous Samsung 3 and 4 but this S7 has incorporated some time saving things eliminated some redundancies offers a lot more storage and is water and dust resistant I have only had this phone for a couple weeks but I really like the design and how the apps have changed and brought more of them together into a bundle to avoid confusion There are several apps within an app like with Verizon  all my Verizon apps are in the Verizon app folder Fast  sleek and simple thats how I see it Every new Galaxy tops the last one and the S7 is fire The design and size are a perfect marriage of the S6 and the edgeplus that came before and the smart switch app seems to have gotten even smoother I have actually already helped two friends give up their OTHER companys phones and now they too have fallen in love with this unit Oh and Marshmallow is light easy and awesome On this phone u can do almost anything its as good as any I phone and the features are incredible I dont know how I got along without it is my right hand I will never be without it from here on out I love my new phone get one you will love it too Brilliant screen Compact size Great outer shell Fast processor Fingerprint scanner remarkably good and consistent SD card was welcomed back Water proof design This is one of the best smartphones around I can not think of anything I dislike I have been a Galaxy fan for some time and other then the S6 Samsung listened to its customers and produced the S7 which more then makes up for the issues the S6 had For this reason I will continue to be a loyal Galaxy customer But this phone has made me think outside of the box I bought it along with the gear s2 classic and am thoroughly enjoying my experience and loving being able to customize everything Wish the battery lasted a little longer though Must have Samsung seems to always come through great phone much better than iPhone I love the split screen and all the memory it has I love the camera WOULDNT BE WITHOUT THE S7 Works great super fast great sleek design Myou wife and I love the phone would recommend upgrading to it The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best smartphone Ive ever owned Its sleek fast and performs tasks exactly as expected The camera is superb the low light capabilities are amazing I like the features of the edge screen placing my favorite apps there as well as some streaming music choices It is very nice looking not too big fits well in my hand Im still learning how to personalize it to my liking there are so many features and ways to arrange everything just the way I want Call quality is good I can hear everyone loud and clear It connects easily to wireless connections as well as bluetooth The screen always shows the time and date and battery level which is handy Overall I havent had any issues with my Galaxy S7 Edge I look forward to seeing how it performs long term The phone is great I like the added features of optional SD card and flashlight I really have no complaints yet So far great phone beats my Note Edge I had before I got the S7 Edge lots of neat stuff The phone is great However I miss the larger screen of my Samsung Note 2 Love the edge feature I can dial certain contacts without unlocking phone Great if there is an emergency and someone needs to contact my family The do not disturb feature is excellent Allows user to designate certain numbers that can still get through Ive only had it about two weeks now and its been a massive leap up from my old Galaxy Note 4 Its faster in every way lighter and absolutely awesome

The only thing that Id wish could be improved is the battery life It can chew through that battery pretty fast if youre making full use of it I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 and this by far is the best Galaxy that Samsung has ever made The phone is quicker and the call quality is far superior to their last Galaxy model I also love the water resistant feature and the wireless charging something that an IPhone can not do Its probably one of better Phones  Ive been iPhone user for years I find the iPhone to be faster and more user friendly But Im figuring out the galaxy and I like the camera better than iPhone I have held out for over 3 years by using the Samsung Galaxy S3 but I finally decided to make the jump to the S7 and Im happy I did The screen is larger the resolution is improved and because of that so has the video quality Samsung provides the option to transfer contacts video etc from the old phone to the new one which made the process a whole lot easier for me and a lot less time consuming With the newer model I can see the difference in speed with the processor as well I like the fact that apps like Amazon are already installed so I didnt need to spend as much time installingupdating apps too My only concern was the functionality of the calendar Its not as userfriendly as it once was on the Galaxy S3 But overall Im very satisfied Loving the s7 edge very fast gr8 battery good 4 gaming fairly easy 1hand use Wish it still had the IR burst Glad you brought back the expanded memory and waterproof features well i am falling in love wiyh myphone it so different from galaxy4 i am experience everyting different Best phone Ive ever seen Samsung pay works almost everywhere Gear vr is really cool and the low light duel pixel camera is amazing I really love this phone Greatest phone I have ever owned Many features and a great camera I love my galaxy S7 It is so awesome The design and layout is pretty and very useful The extended settings make is so convenient to get to what I need I love the amount of storage I have to install lots of apps If I ever need more space there is the option of the micro SD card too I love how fast it is to charge and it holds the charge for days I love the screens slightly curved edges that are so smooth The speaker gets really loud and is great for movies and music The camera is awesome Even at night I can take really cool pictures The pictures come out with that HD quality The camera has cool editing features too Like when you take a screenshot you can capture the entire page and areasee that arent shown on the original screenshot Overall this phone is the best I love that the edge variant has a longer battery life I can easily get through a day without having tom bring a charger like I did with my Galaxy S5 I love this phone so far the graphics are amazing and the pictures are unbelievable The only complaint I have is the battery life When idle sitting over night I went from 80 to 17 why I have no idea the android system seems to be constantly using the battery when idle So Im really disappointed in the battery life but the phone itself I love I have had cell phones for years but never one that was even close to the S7 Edge My office is in a metal warehouse that prevents phone calls or text messages However since upgrading to this phone I do get text and some calls Most of the applications on the phone are super I thought this was too much phone for my wife and I and almost didnt go for it due to the price After having it for awhile we both love it the camera is the best I have seen on any phone I was surprised to find the Samsung Health program helps me keep track of my physical activity which is important when your in your 70s The more I use the phone the more I like it I would recommend this phone I am very satisfied greatly and very happy with my phone Overall a solid phone Long lasting battery fast etc One complaint is that the edge screen still isnt all that useful doesnt add much to operation of device just aesthetics People definitely notice it though The Internet does not always connect or it drops K The Samsung Galaxy S7 really kicked it up a notch with the additional data storage on the S7 I no longer need to worry about deleting apps when running low on space which is a HUGE relief While the design itself is beautiful the only downsize is the size of the phone With how large the screen is I have been unsuccessful in finding a tempered glass that will fit over the entire screen This has been its only downfall as the screen doesnt look as good with the ill fitted glass on top for extra precautions This is something I can live with because of how amazing everything else is on this phone A personal favorite of mine is the fact of how water resistant the phone is I no longer need to worry about dropping my phone near water or accidentally spilling something on it Such an improvement I would certainly recommend the S7 and am very pleased with my purchase It has better features than the s6 did and is still great in design I like how simple the phone is to operate Yet its features are extremely high tec An evolutionary upgrade from the s6 Camera is quick to focus Battery lasts all day Though way too much bloatware Wish it had Quick Charge 30 and a USBC connector Front facing speakers would be nice too  I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It is Amazing The HD screen is super The Edge functions are awesome I couldnt live without this phone I love that this phone is a little bigger It fits in your hand well and is capable of using with one hand So you can eat a sandwich with the other  The onboard features of the phone are great Touch screen is responsive phone is beautiful and camera is the best Ive ever had Battery life is average at best Biggest issue with the phone is that many apps do not work well with it Most of my streaming apps such as Spotify will pause frequently for no reason This isnt an internet issue as the Galaxy S5 streams just fine on the same services Also Ive noticed the compass feature doesnt work with certain apps Hopefully there are some updates that fix these issues but until then I am somewhat dissatisfied with this phone since I cannot use my favorite apps anymore Ive had three Samsungs so far and Im not only impressed but Im absolutely content with sticking with this phone No other phones have near as much character Seriously no other You want personalization This is it period This is a great phone and has good performance The only thing Is I wish they has a matte or non reflective version of the phone Great phone for a great value Screen resolution and features compiled with efficiency gives this phone a major edge Phone is awesome but they come out without many options for screen protectors Phone is absolutely great though  Im very happy with it Takes amazing pictures The colors are very bright also very clear Phones have great features Slick design and looks higher quality than samsung products before s7 Great camera and all around great phone Stylish design and great battery life Have issues with fast charging and wifi which hopefully gets fixed fast thru updates Truly miss feature of the note 4 remote control feature and hope they bring it back in s8 or sooner This phone is pretty awesome It runs a lot smoother than the S4 I upgraded from The details in the games that I play are so much more crisper and game play is quicker I really love being able to customize my messaging My eyes arent the best so I appreciate being able to adjust the colors of my background and text bubbles to colors that I like and arent harsh on my eyes Overall I love this phone Galaxy fan for life I thing the camera with all the features and especially the low light great picture taking is supurb Bought the S7 for the camera A BIG improvement in camera and overall performance from the S5 I like the feature that keeps the phone off when in your pocket unlike the S5 which would unlock and do all kids of things in my pocket The only problem I have is the constant SD card inserted reminder that comes and goesDoing a Google search and this is a common problem Not a deal breakerbut should be fixed with an upgrade If you pick one up grab a Wireless Fast Charger Sureyou can do without itbut its pretty darn cool and convenient There are some things I really like about this phone but there are some features I wish they kept from the s5 I wish it stays on during charging does not stay connected to WiFi very well the auto brightness does not work very well either and I still can not fine a music player that works as well as the s5 standard music player Love this phone and would recommend to anyone wanting a new phone This product is better than I expected it is a must have I love the galaxy line but the camera on this has them all beat This phones display is amazing even in full sunlight
Samsung pay is a great feature and easy to use The S7edge is by far my favorite phone I have owned The screen is a very clear crisp picture The camera tages very good pictures This phone is perfect every feature beats the IPhone hands down there is no comparison I LOVE MY PHONE IF YOU TRY ITYOU WILL BUY IT They hwve improved the processor and camera Giving us the ability to add more storage is also a plus
 Its sleeker than the 5 and theyve got a lot more sexy colors to chpose from Keep up the good work Samsung Ive just had the phone a week upgraded from the Motorola Turbo and I am enjoying it It was easy to setup using Verizon Cloud and I had it up and running within a very short time span including inserting the 32GB micro SD card The reviews are correct This phone is the best cellular phone Ive ever owned After using other phones from other manufacturers Ive become a loyal Samsung customer This is my second Galaxy phone and I was waiting for the S7 to be released The phone is gorgeous The battery lasts all day Its easy to use while being the latest in technology The displays are easy to read The options are endless My sister is equally as thrilled with her S7 Edge This is a homerun product Im not giving this phone this amazing device all 5 stars to be phony no Im giving all 5s because it is by far the best most exciting phenomenal smart phone on the market Samsung pay alone is worth having something that rivals do not have Samsung vr leading the way and all the Samsung apps that support the device second to none And thats just for entertainment purposes now the processing power Screensaver weight of the phone fast charging and SD card support that beats all rivals in my very strong opinion Ive had the s5 for two years and I was one of the first to have the s7 Im proud excited and very satisfied to have this device and Im only learning what it is capable of and I know I only use 20 of what is designed to do The most important advanced is the superior battery improved I owned the S6 edge and the S6 edge plus But with this new power Samsung elevated the S line to no comparison Is awesome The new screen size is the other best thing I really like and love this device I really like the new features like video calling and the new gold color is very nice My son who is 6 months old gets to see his dad during lunch because we use the video calling feature which is so easy to use Its a great phone nice design still taking time to get to know all of the features i was using iphone 6plus  but this time i transferred to samsung galaxy edge 7 and i like this phone so much  i will recommend this phone The S7 is an improvement over the S6 which was already an amazing device But my S6 always ended up on low battery before I got through the day The S7 has a much better battery life seems to run faster and my photos are even more amazing I took a trip this week to Niagara Falls and toured some of the historical areas in New England and I was impressed that my phone was able to keep up with GPS constantly looking up site information and taking thousands of pictures which by the way were incredible I could see details in the waterfalls when I zoomed in on my photos that werent visible just looking at the Falls and when I took site photos I could read the signs in my photos later Awesome I can actively run a lot of apps without the processing time getting bogged down So far this phone does not disappoint The Galaxy S7 Edge offers an exceptional display great performance stellar camera beautiful design and a great battery life Things like water resistance wireless charging microSD card slot and Fast Charging are cherries on top TouchWiz can still feel bloated at times but this is undoubtedly the best Galaxy phone Samsung has ever made Living on the edge never felt so good I have had 4 or 5 generations of Samsung products and have loved them all Very responsive and fast What I love the most is how responsive it is taking photos I have had my S7 for two weeks and I am extremely satisfied with all aspects of this great Samsung product I highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a new phone Best phone Ive owned yet Beautiful design great features and so user friendly Phone is amazing Very happy with it The quality of the phome is great and the speed and ease of useare wonderful One of the best parts is the camera Great pictures I use the slow motion camera to find issues with the equipment I work on 
The phone is comfortable to handle Easy to make calls and text It is also easy to use to get my emails
The pictures are very clear and easy to send So far this product is amazing Its has everything I need fast and easy to use I have owned all five versions of the Note I was highly disappointed in the Note 5 I upgraded to the s7 Edge early because of Note 5 I store a lot of high resolution photographs The S7 has fixed many of the previous versions problemsThank you for improving your phones Every model gets better Sharper and clearer resolution Sound quality Durability Attractive phone with many great features I upgraded from a Samsung S4 and love the features on this phone My only complaint is it looks almost exactly like my wifes iphone6 Best I ever owned including iPhones and Windows phones This phone is such a great upgrade from my s5 It takes some awesome pictures and I love the new features and how easy it is to use Apps freezing Slow and lagging Performance very unpredictably The design is really very good as is the performance for most things except the ability to download updates via WiFi from the Google Play Store  it just sits there downloading any update for hours unless I turn off the WiFi and let it use the LTE data path All other WiFi functions seem a little slow but at least they complete This is not a problem on my S6 Edge my Tab S2 or my wifes Motorola DROID MAXX I have changed every WiFi setting on the S7 Edge that I can find the channels used for both 24 and 5 GHz on my router but still the problem persists

The return of the micro SD card is a real plus as is a battery that for my usage at least lasts all day compared to the 48 hours of the S6 Edge When entering characters from a display keyboard the edge screen takes a little getting used to but the S6 Edge was the same way

All in all Im very satisfied with my S7 Edge but Im hoping that there will be a solution for the WiFi problem with the Play Store updates  two system updates so far have not solved it S3 S5 and S6 had but the S7 surpasses all previous phones is a gather between S5 and S6 The camera is also better follow completely redesigned so an the gear s2 1 I love the phone is perfect and the camera take beautiful pictures Best phone ever waterproof is a plus love samsung products Good phone just lost some featuresoptions I liked having on my S4 This phone is awesome One of the best phones samsung made I love the camera Pictures are so beautiful The battery is great last long and you dont have to worry about over charging it The sleek built I love nice and thin I have no complaints about the next best thing I love me new phone  And I would recommend this to everyone  I love the picture quality and how easy it is to use I love this phone and All its featuresSamsung all the way Ive had the s7 about a month now and have no complaints The camera both rear and front facing are great everything is user friendly and Im a big fan of the improved security I havent tested out the waterproof thing yet and really dont plan on trying that on purpose I love the camera The phone is a little glitchy at times but overall I am happy with my new phone This is hands down the phone of the year With a large screen compact size and lighting fast speed you cant go wrong I have owned a Samsung all of the flagship devices from the competition None of them can compete with this phone Even the last 3 years of the Note series or Galaxy Southwest series This is the best phone Samsung ever made and designed

I recently took my s7 edge on a trip and the videos and pictures were life like I was blown away phone is extremely light takes a beating if dropped too Battery life is really good Ive gone 1 day and 17 hours with medium to heavy use 

Everyone should own this phone

I have the gold platinum color Looks really nice I had the galaxy s4 This is a vast improvement The camera battery life wireless charger 200gb expandable memory and health app are the big things I like about this phone 

A big down side is no IR blaster Amazingly fast and innovative My only complaint is the lack of an IR blaster Having come from a Galaxy S4 I was very used to having a remote We absolutely love the phone I had the S5 and recently upgraded to the next program to be able to get the S7 The design is great Settings is easy to maneuver thru and all the sounds and themes are perfect Love the amount of potential space you can have All of the best features and easy to use I love changing my themes It really gives your phone your own personal touch I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S5 which I loved Needing an upgrade I chose the S7 Edge It is fantastic The features are endless and I am making fun discoveries daily 

This phone is fast clear and addictive Id recommend it to anyone Best camera ever light weight love the wireless charging feature but the battery seems to drain quickly 
Still working out the kinks The new Galaxy Gs7 is so easy to use I love how clear the pictures are and how much easier it is to take the picture by just tapping the screen The clarity of talking to another person one the phone is amazing Also when one of your chosen people call its great how the color will light up if your phone is flipped over so you know whos calling before you even look Another awesome feature is the visual voice mail I really like being able to choose which message I want to listen to first Also its extremely helpful that the phone is water resistant Love the new Galaxy Gs7 This is a great product Ive owned many Samsung products but this one is by far the best Love it I cant get my work email to load on itthe service tek at the email said the phone is to new and it wont recognize the portsall other email worked finemaybe they just need to do an upgrade on the software I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Its beautifully designed features are great the camera is crazy awesome AND it wont break if I get caught in the rain during a run Seriouslybestphoneever The phone is nice easy to use and the performance is top notch I love the camera and all the features it packs and there is no lag in doing anything Love through design of the curved screen Phone is fast does everything and some This S7 is even better than my beloved S5
It is quick and looks great 
The camera is beyond amazing on it I really think they made the right choice there Let me say I am extremely happy and proud to have the new Galaxy S7 I feel great using it and finding out new features every day about it that I didnt know about since it has so many I love the new camera it is crystal clear and the processor is extremely fast Would not trade it for an IPhone thats for sure Team Samsung Galaxy all the way Always been a Samsung Galaxy user and will remain that way This phone has a few upgrades from the 5 that are great 
A little smaller in size moved the speaker location much better screen quality and the camera takes awesome photos Upgraded from the S5 Active which I loved Havent looked back Love the battery life and of course performance is great being the newest tech I absolutely love my s7 edge The speed screen resolution camera improvemens are unbeatable I havent finished exploring the phones capabilities but what I have explored thus far is amazing This S7 is fast very fast the slim design is perfect for my suit pockets pants pockets etc The battery life exceeds my expectations I just upgraded from the Galaxy 3 and there is a world of difference It has speed and features I couldnt even imagine So far its great Great phone Has great features Love the short cut button and picure preview in camera The Samsung Galaxy S7 has a great display and camera great for capturing moments with my family However it is missing the feature to use the phone as a remote and has alot of the same functions as any other precious version of the Galaxy I upgraded from a galaxy s5 and it was one of the best decisions I could have made The features are great it runs incredibly fast and looks amazing My only issue right now is they got rid of the music app from their previous devices I started using Google play and that works ok All in all a great phone I like this phone Only bad feature is the battery has a very short life before needing to be recharged The battery only last for 8 to 10 hours before almost dead The high resolution cameras high speed processor and high resolution screen make this phone an awesome option The added fingerprint scanner offers a quick and easy way to unlock your phone and it also offers a trusted device setup where when that device is near your phone will remain unlocked The only downsides that I have encountered ar some occasional glitches in certain apps probably due to the new deviceAndroid Version Marshmellow Overall this phone is an amzing product and I highly reccomend it Good battery life sleekbeautiful fasr and so forth and so on I like it that phone Very fast and perfect fit on my hands Improved over the Galaxy s5 just as slim stylish and easy to use as before but the s7 brings about the key features Wireless Charging more efficient use of storage better battery use and expanded memory If needing an electronic mobile device for personal and business use this is a Must Have device as it kicks things up another notch or two and becomes your go to Mobile companion Highly recommeded When I received this phone it was amazing right out the box great feel has a very luxurious look the phone is fast and hasnt glitches on me since I got it
My only complaint is the edges every time I see a video accidently press the side and it bothers me but other than that amazing phone Everything that one would expect from a modern smartphone is here Touch screen works great has amazing performance thanks to the dragon processor and has amazing quality hardware including camera buttons and screen resolution

The two problems I have with the phone are its innability to turn off the volume warning when you turn up the volume louder than the phone recommends and the fact that you cant bind the flashlight to a side button by default

Otherwise great phone After the 4 note then the 5 note this one is the best one period Please Samsung continue to challenge yourself My daughter change from the iPhone to the 7S and my son in law from the 6 edge to the 7 edge
Congratulations Samsung

The camera is much better than the s5 The sound is great The HD is amazing Just moved up to the new Galaxy S7 form my old Galaxy S3  To say this is a move up is an understatement  There have been so many major improvements made to the Galaxy S7 that its like comparing night and day The excellent screen resolution Improved battery life upgraded processor speed just to name a few Moving up to the Galaxy S 7 is like going from fast food to fine dining Samsung has exceeded all expectation with this phone Thanks Samsung  I love my new GS7 Edge They battery life and the size are the biggest wins on this phone and because I also work the cellular industry the edge display helps with all of my needs to get what I need quickly and efficiently I would recommend this phone to anyone If you guys didnt remove the IR blaster option this phone would get 5 stars hands down but since you decided to skimp on something that the previous galaxys all had and had I know it didnt have it would have never bought this phone All I own is Samsung products and being able to use my phone to control them all is priceless The S7 edge is a great phone Very fast lots of wonderful features Display and sound quality are amazing and the Health S app is a new favorite The only thing bad I would say about this phone is the screen isnt very durable whatsoever Had it for less then a week in an Otter box case first time I dropped it the screen shattered If you get this phone make sure you get a screen protector before anything else The cost of the screen is about a third of the full price of the phone I think I picked this phone because it was great looking with the curved screen the Display is fantastic The battery life is great but the difference between the Edge and the lower priced model is not worth the price 

The main differences is the curved screen and the battery life 
1 the curved screen other then looks the features it gives you are useless 
2 the phone is so smooth and slippery that if you dont have it in a case you WILL drop it so you have a great looking phone that you have to keep in a case 
3 the curve of the screen makes it hard to hold and not touch the screen with your fingers and that causes muli touch or selecting things you dont want again a case fixes this  
4 the feature that lets you pop up menus by swiping the curve is pretty much useless the aps dont work or update yahoo has been the same since I got the phone Just a gimmick that does not work well 

In short if I was going to buy a phone today I would get the lower priced S7 it looks just like the S5 I had but I think it would be just as useful Everything is awesome Screen resolution super fast and the camera is amazing First galaxy owned I love it Cant wait to get my vr kit Im still getting used to the features and like it so far The interesting and beneficial thing about the Settings function is that there is a Search feature as well So as your learning how to work something you can always try searching for it over exploring each tab To start off I switched from iPhones to Galaxys back in 2011 with the S4 Then I moved to the S5 Active in 2014 Having switched from the iPhones I always felt Samsung just got it right from a functionality standpoint Advanced features great look Android interface and especially the added storage option However when my S5 Active got a little dated I was excited for the S6 but then was completely let down on how they removed some of the critical functions Id always appreciated Over the last several months I even considered switching back to iPhone 

Once I held the new S7 in my hand and saw what they had done I knew it would be an instant purchase and Id never look back Samsung has literally taken everything the Galaxy fans loved on each of the past models and simply improved them in one phone Expandable memory  check Amazing camera  better than ever Display  better than ever Speed  lightning fast Intelligencesoftware  incredibly efficient Battery  not replaceable but more efficient and upgraded for the edge Literally everything Ive loved about a smart phone is updated and exceeding expectations with the new S7 Its an unreal phone and have been recommending it to anyone that will listen even iPhone users Its just a great tool in an increasingly tech driven era and reaffirmed my decision in becoming a Samsung fan This phone has many great features I love the fact that it is waterproof Working outside it is great The low camera lighting is great I tried it in a dark bedroom and was surprised at how well it turned out I really cant say anything bad about this phone Easy to use featuresthe camera is greatplus more storage love the SD SLOTloving every features of it I have had this phone for one week and am still on a learning curve I think it will be great once I get used to it A little disappointed with the battery First let me start out by stating I have tried Samsung phones before but never really found one I liked enough to keep  returned them This phone however is an absolute winner By far my favorite phone I have owned thus far Amazingly fast camera IP68 water resistant good battery life great display expandable storage fun design what more could you want My only wishes would be that the phone were about 110th of an inch smaller across  tall to fit my hands a little better and that there was a usable tempered glass screen protector available One of improvement is how the camera focus object in a fraction of second  there are a lot design to apply in pictures ability to increase the devices memory A fast charging battery motion pictures is awesome to see the seconds before a pictures its like is pictures recover life  Ive had my phone for about 3 weeks now as of 402 and this phone is amazing The battery life I am able to use this phone continuously throughout the day and when I get home from work I still have roughly a 40 battery This is way better than past phones Ive had The speed of the phone is extremely quick the visuals are fluid no lag from what I see and the actual shape of the phone I thought would be weird to hold but it actually feels extremely comfortable It looks amazing in person and the roundness of the screen on the edges makes looking at the screen more enjoyable Instead of the screen just ending it looks like it could keep going on forever since it slightly curves at the end After going through many phones Ive finally come back to the Galaxy and Im very happy with what I got I love my Samsung Galaxy s7 edge It is sleek and has awesome features I use my phone as my camera and Im very happy with the camera on this phone It takes very clear pictures and it even take great low light pictures Overall this phone is excellent Samsung has done a great job with its latest smartphone The GS7 improves on the GS6 by adding features that we have not seen since the GS5 I am very pleased with the screen quality build sound and the camera has a fast auto focus The best part of this phone is the ability to record in 4K and pictures are great in low light conditions Nicer camera and faster but some setting options and setup features lacking My google calendar doesnt show times in schedule view which is makes me more inefficient trying to work and make meetings It did in the S5 There doesnt seem to be as many options in setting up functionality as with the S5 The phone has to connect manually to my car I tried to delete the pair in Bluetooth and replace still same results I have had a few Samsung phones but this by far is the greatest one yet You really struck the nail on the head with it I really like the feel of the phone and the features I wish the screen was bigger I like the edge feature and how I can access my apps I would recommend this to people if they are interested in a slightly larger phone but not too big This is absolutely the best phone I have ever ownedUnderwater videos makes those other phone users put it back in their pocketsWhaaattttttAll Im saying is if you dont have a s7 what are you doing with your life

Galaxy Forever I love my 7 I keep getting the Galaxys and Samsung has never disappointed me the 7 not being any different If you are thinking of one jump on it you will be happy you did The best thing about this phone is the battery last me about twice as long I had the S6 Edge previously and by the end of the day I would be down to less than 10 battery The S7 at the end of the day I am at around 50 battery I am glad they brought back the memory card Please bring back the feature that was on the S4 active I think where all you had to do was hold down the volume up key to turn the flashlight on That was so convenient The phone fits well in your hand with the curved back I purchased this phone to replace my galaxy S5 that was statying to give me issues I also got the VR for free for preordering I honestly dont have anything bad to say We are Samsung lovers for life Amazing products I purchased this phone for my husband as a surprise and boy was he excited We also got the VR for free for preordering I honestly dont have anything bad to say We are Samsung lovers for life Amazing products Galaxy 6 was first up to date phone ive purchased in years only draw back was no MSD slot so i upgraded to Galaxy 7 and i have been completely happy in its performance I replaced a Note 4 with the S7 So far Im pleased The camera is out of this world Clear crisp display and responsive I like the size and the weight

I am puzzled about not being able to replace the battery Hoping that it lasts for as long as I want to keep the phone It tends to get hot with a lot of use but I havent received any warning that the phone is overheating

All in all I am impressed Im a geek and I tend to switch phones often Ive owned most to all of the flagship devices and this one is a keeper 

The design is amazing For a phone with a 55 screen the device is easy to hold and use with one han The edges are made just right and is awesome to use 

Battery life is great the screen is gorgeous and the camera is phenomenal There are some added features that are very useful and convenient like Samsung Pay double click to launch camera and the screen edge features Samsung is overall the best when it comes to cell phones Great performance easy to use and super dependable in battery life Samsung for life I wish I didnt get one that had issues So I have to wait for a new one But I am very Happy that I made this purchase The edge feature isnt working and my ATT phone book is a mess ATT cant remote into my 7edge to see what is going on I do HATE that there isnt a separate music app like my S5 I dont feel I should have a use Google music to listen or store my music  plus a lot of my songs didnt transfer to this device I do hope they upgrade that on a update soon Other than that I am enjoying it This phone is a BEAST I have had so much fun using it The pictures it takes are amazing Well worth the money in my opinion Bought S7 two weeks ago My experience thus far has been mixed A week after purchase my screen was blank after charging all night I could receive calls and hear notifications but see any operations I went online and saw several sites devoted to this issue with Galaxy S5  S7 phones A remedy was discussed on a few websites I took the phone to a Verizon Wireless store and they immediately did what I had previously seen onlineheld the power and volume down buttons for approximately 10 seconds causing a reset which eventually produced an operable viewing screen This problem seems to be widely known and needs to addressed by Samsung in patch or sw update The second problem I also had with my S4 which is the dropping of Bluetooth service when making or receiving calls In all fairness it might be a Plantronics issue even though I traded in my Voyager Legend model for a Voyager Edge and still have the same problem it is frustrating Otherwise I love the features of the S7 along with its increased internal memory  SD card option improved camera abilities and overall ergonomics One of the best phones I have ever owned The functionality is awesome It fits perfectly in my end due to the small curve Havent dropped it any water yet but the demo that was done when I purchased the phone sold me on the water resistance The sd card placement is amazing and Im glad its back Ive been in the cell phone industry for over 10 years This is by far the best phone Ive ever had The water resistance and external memory are obviously fantastic It can definitely handle multiple things at once I am a strong user and it almost never glitches or slows down I love that I can store a ton of my music and some movies I also have the Virtual Reality headset and a Moga game controller These have both been so much fun I have the Samsung S2 watch on the way These are all amazing entertainment things For practical use my whole life is in this phone My personal and work email are in this phone My passwords and bill pay are in this phone I wake up to the alarm clock everyday My calendar is in this phone I take notes and make to do lists on this phone I just cannot say enough how much I use this phone and how well it works This phone runs my whole life the fun parts and the necessary parts

The only things I would improve are the battery life I love love love the fast charging I have the fast charger pad I just wish I didnt have to do it so often In its defense I have the Bluetooth on all the time which I know drains the battery but I use that with my Jawbone UP to monitor my heart rate and sleep I have a rare illness that I have to monitor Also I wish the alarm was louder I need to find a good app to download for that 

Overall great phone that I am totally satisfied with This is my 2nd Samsung Galaxy 1sr wasn the S4 so when thecS7 came out I was ready to upgrade thisS7 Edge isso simple to use and the camera functions much improved As with all my Samsung products I EXPECT THIS NEW PHONE TO GIVE ME YRS OF STELLAR RELIABILITY This is a great phone Nice design Has a good camera with a lot of options Easy to use The best phone you can choose in mid2016 Light bright and fast Pure Android may be attractive but the Samsung additions do not get in the way and some are actually enhancements One knock on Samsung has been its slowness at sending updates to even even recent hardware but there is evidence that their attitude is changing Lets hope that is for real If youve been considering a Nexus 5X I was consider the Galaxy S7 to be the 5P for Premium My new Galaxy 7 has awesome screen colors Every app comes to life This is a nice phone that brought back some of the features that were left out of the GS 6 Its sorely missing a removeable battery but the sd card slot and the waterproofing are great It fits my hand perfectly and was a nice upgrade to the gs5 It has a good feel to it as well Not heavy but solid The fingerprint sensor could be better but its a nice feature I hope they continue to upgrade samsung pay It works about 50 of the time for me Fun phone and its a huge improvement over the gs6 The battery life and processor speed are so much better than my old S5 was handsdown Some of the settings and features have changed so there was a bit of a learning curve but overall I am very happy with it Im very happy with my S7 Holds a charge for most of my day Im always on the road using Bluetooth and Hotspot at the same time With an external SD card I have most of my music library with me Its a great product I was apprehensive about the switch but the G7 made it very easy for me So many useful toolsdoesnt feel like Im merely playing with an expensive toy coughApplecough I have had two issues since I bought it though honestly with how much I find it to be useful it is hard to see the negatives 1 I got the black screen of death just yesterday I was freaked out but I did a normal reset on my phone and got back onto it immediately Also the battery life is nothing to speak about and I think I must charge it at least twice a day but I use it for all sorts of things such as a visual schedule and alarm clock Im a special ed teacher in a sensory classroom and I also use the memo to write my ledger for my budget and things Very useful I tried to install themes and also freaked out about an app completely changing the graphics and taking over my home screen I didnt like that very much as I felt I had no control over my phone but after some toggling I returned back to my original simple theme It has all day battery life even when connected to my gear s2 all day 
The edge display looks fantastic and I like the edge features 
The snapdragon processor is super fast
Its the smoothest android device I have used 
The phone just looks beautiful I am in love with my Galaxy S7 Edge Beautiful and jam packed with awesome features Everything I ever wanted in a phone and more Samsungs back at it with this gorgeous curved glass beauty I have had this phone for about two weeks and I would say the most impressive feature of the new phone is the camera I upgraded from the S5 and I do like many of the smaller features like the new themes that are used to customize your backgrounds and icons I also think that the S VOICE works better on the S7 than my S5 It seems more responsive and better understands my commands The battery life is better than the S5 and I am usually at 30 battery life after moderate use over 14 hours between charging I would recommend this phone to my friends Great phone I love all features esp the camera also the ease of the phone and water proof My dad dropped his in the lake on accident stayed submerged for about 20 minutes still works This product is amazing overall in and out but I dropped it once from a 1 foot drop and it cracked the display Needless to say it is not durable Before upgrading to the S7 I had the S4 and what a major difference between the two models The enhanced user interface and grouping of apps Make my use of the phone more personal The shape of the phone is just right Every professional I just traded up to the Samsung S7 and couldnt be happier The camera is exceptional and extremely sharp There is plenty of memory for all my apps Phone reception on the Verizon network is great My wife still has an older flip phone but is starting to use mine more often I can see another S7 coming soon I had a Galaxy S6 and wasnt all that happy with it But this new S7 Edge fixed all the issues The battery life is far better Camera is awesome Now has the ability to expand memory with an SD card And the water resistance was put back in This is the phone Ive always wanted I upgraded from a S5 so I did not have the problem of storage like some of the S6 customers had however I was ready for this upgrade 
The S5 has some water resistance but not like this S7 The S7 does not need plugs or other deterrents to keep it from being water resistant It comes this way from the factory sealed and ready for people like me This is a huge advantage because liquid damage is always my greatest worry I am a klutz and I have 3 kids Who wouldnt worry
I dumped an entire glass of ice water of my S5 and was terrified it wouldnt work but it held up just great so I KNOW this S7 will be even more amazing
I love the Samsung Pay app I just hope that it will soon work with my debit card to make life even easier 
I love the gold color My husband got the black and wished they offer white as well but we are still happy and you dont even notice the colors after you put a case on it 
Pairing a durable case and screen protector with this phone will make it virtually indestructible provided a mechanical defect doesnt fry a screen overheat etc which happened to my first S5 The phone overheated and then my screen went black 
I am still learning new tricks and gizmos on this phone but so far I am loving it and my husband loves his too I need to watch some videos to see all the fun stuff it does Just upgraded from Samsung S4 Active Better camera very long battery life easy to use interface So many possibilities to explore Overall a great phone this phone is living up to what all the news articles have said The only problem I have had with this phone that in the very beginning it would shut down and reboot itself In one night it did it 4 times but it has done for the last 6 days so hopefully whatever bug that was causing it has worked it self out I waited for this phone to come out and Im glad I did This is my second Samsung phone and I will never purchase a phone from a different company

sleek 
super fast
amazing camera By far the best
has everything i need
Samsung Pay is ultra convenient and easy to use
much much much better than any other product
 and able to zoom in really close The phone has met and exceeded my expectations The processor is really fast has great features and really easy to maneuver in the settings Especially glad to see the expandable memory back Love everything about the s7 edge Camera is amazing Had the note 3 and upgraded to s7 edge and couldnt be happier with it The Samsung S7 is by far a better phone than the Iphone The operating system features apps and camera make this phone useful and fun to play with I would recommend the Samsung S7 to anyone who wants a powerful useful and fun phone This is a big beautiful phone Perhaps a little too big but the curved edges make it feel more manageable The features work well and the interface seems easy to navigate The edge panels are mildly useful but could be used better It would be good if I could get Google Now like notifications of anticipated events on the side panel automatically for example popping up an alert on expected traffic around the time I usually head home or a meeting summary when I head into a meeting something like a list of attendees subject etc I previously have the note 5 But this phone got me at sd card slot and water resistant Its high quality and works great Wouldnt trade it for any other phone I love the gold color and I love all the new updates I went from a galaxy s4 to the galaxy s7 and its amazing how much further technology has come in just a couple years Glad that they brought back MicroSD so that I dont have to rely on cloud storage The design of the edge is interesting still trying to adjust but starting to get more useful My favorite feature is the ultimate power saver which gives me about 3 days of active battery life This is by far one of the best phones I have tried Everything from the features to texture of the phone is awesome It has a nice big screen with great graphics Playing games on this phone looks amazing The edge screen is nice you can get everything from news to contacts from it The phone has a great camera with lots of cool functions You can do virtual photos slow motion fast motion and more The pictures come out beautiful The look and design is great fits perfectly in your hands It isnt bulky and its water resistant These are great phones There is so many features with this phone I could write all day The speed is great and you can operate so many apps at the same time without a problem The clarity and sharpness is just magnificent You can always see your time on the screen without having to push any buttons Taking selfies with this is great I highly recommend this phone and I would be lost without it Absolutely amazing I like the splash proof design and the scratch proof glass and all the different features the phone offers I dig my Samsung phone I will always buy Samsung android phones Forget the IPHONE forever Had phone for 3 weeks and have had restart the phone every other day Today I had no service on my phone when I should have had 4G Its okay it works Switched from an IPhone and I am very glad Awesome camera Great phone love the new features Best phone yet Let me be the first to say I came over from the iPhone 6 I love this phone the functionality and ease of use tops the iphone However the video chat I travel a lot for work I got this phone for me and the wife because they had a video chat Yes finally my thoughts Then left for Utah the next day Video chat turns directly to voice call Why doesnt this use WiFi like facetime Skype was an easy alternative The split screen happens all the time I wont even be touching anything and I get a divided screen and also I will swipe to unlock my phone and the screen will turn right back off immediately sometimes 2 or 3 times in a row its very aggravating other than that its OK This phone is wonderful everything is so responsive and easy Im still learning all the things I can do with it Samsung has created a really great piece of technology here This is my first upgrade since the S4 was new I am beyond impressed Super fast great camera five stars all around Impressive This is by far the best smartphone I have ever owned I recently upgraded from the galaxy s5 and I have been blown away by themail enhanced features The pictures are stunning even in low light Samsung pay makes checking out a breeze and screen resolution ia noticeably better especially while using Samsung Galaxy Gear VR which is a must own for an unbelievableaffordalet vr experience This phone does all the things a phone should do and does it better than any other phone on the market I almost forgot my favorite feature the customizable eq makes for an amazing listening experience for the audiophile The S7 Edge is an allaround great phone It has a huge bright screen is wonderfully slim and performs in a flash The edge panel kinda gets in the way sometimes but is still a cool feature I love the Flipboard briefing when you slide to the right It keeps me up to date with everything Im interested in and updates frequently I dig the fingerprint entry mode but sometimes its funky Technology cant be perfect I suppose The price was quite hefty and thats definitely a negative I am very impressed with the camera and added features The added tab one the side is great for favorite contacts and apps Very fast I was able to get some great pics and video of my son graduation as a Marine  This new phone is easy to use and makes daytoday business and social activity a breeze There are a few things I miss from previous models but even without those few things this device so far is the best Samsung device Ive owned The fingerprint scanner is leaps and bounds better The new edge is nicer and cleaner than previous versions And just the feel of the device is better So far this has been a good sturdy phone With the MicroSD card makes it better than the S6 Its lighter and a better screen Ive owned almost every version of Galaxy out there The S7 edge is by far my favorite The design of this phone is amazing It feels great in my hand and the processor is so smooth and fast My favorite feature is the display The color saturation is flawless and watching HD movies on this device is wonderful This phone does not feel cheap or flimsy PLUS Samsung brought back expandable memory Oh happy days Galaxy S7 edge slim sharp images light weight easy to use crystal clear speakers better then the iPhone thats why I switched phones  A must have product I actually bought this phone for the gear vr since this is the cheapest option to get a quality vr device I have never really liked Samsung as a developer since they are so locked down and I wont be able to root the phone This phone however has completely changed my mind It has so many cool features and the phone is just beautiful It is truly the nicest bit of tech I have ever owned The only issues I have with this phone is that it is so nice that you are scared it will break very easily and I have been reading reviews from people who had the gear vr break the glass on the back of the phone Other than that though this phone is amazing This phone was up and running will ally apps and contacts with minutes The easiest transition to a new phone I have ever seen No more hours of downloading the apps I use No searching through settings to add accounts It was just to easy

The battery life is good but I will say I may need to do some tweaking to get more out of the battery since it wont make it through a day with moderate use

I will miss the IR feature from my last phone too Didnt know this was without until the apps to control my TV failed to work
Without the IR feature I will still recommend this product to friends It has replaced my laptop completely Paying bills working in Excel creating PDF files and the amazing camera made this my everyday tool for work and play Phone is great I like the fact they added a micro sd slot back into the phone Great phone All of the apps pop on the screen with such vibrant colors I work in park maintenance for a 40 acre mobile home park this phone has been rained on dropped kicked dunked into things i will no describe here and still works flawlessly with a quick rinse off Loving it I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge All of the features are cool The pictures are so clear and the phone is beautiful I really love the video chat feature1 I got the phone on March 18th and love everything about it Great camera and really fast and smooth Awesome screen and much more responsive than the iPhone 6s plus I had was I do not regret moving from the iPhone to this product and if samsung keeps making products like this I will stay Love the phone and features the quality of the phone pics and specially the front camera is amazing Really fast
samsung pay is awesome I am still learning about this phone My work schedule has dramatically decreased the amount of time I have to explore this phone  all of its features so I really dont have much to say I will say however that the battery isnt lasting as long as I thought it would  my data usage has doubled Could be from the time I have spent researching power saving options data usage  accessories for this phone Hard to say I love the screen Picture quality sound quality  videos I have watched are all excellent I would recommend this phone It is a bit pricey but it is a mini computer  one of the newest best smart phones on the market I love the style beauty speed finger print security is flawless I believe it is the best phone so far that Samsung has produced I was an iPhone user up until I got the Samsung S5 have upgraded to the S7 and I am very pleased with the upgrades Samsung has done It has the water proof and the SD card is back beautiful design highly recommend I love my phone the picture quality is a1the sleek design to the phone is unlike any other I love the battery life The cameras look so clear like HD I love the design Overall my favorite phone Perfect size The phone itself is great with lots of features Specially the Samsung pay is so easy to use and works at over 90 of the stores The cooling is really great too When the phone gets hot it cools down in few minutes Only down sides are pictures has curved line when I took pictures through camera apps and finger print scanner is not great as iphone Otherwise the phone has lots of great features than iPhone for sure I originally switched to the galaxy phones with the s6 This phone I think fixed everything wrong with the s6 I originally wanted the expandable storage which they brought back and the phone runs much smoother than the s6 Ive had no complaints in the first month of owning it Love love love galaxy s7 Awesome features Easy to use Great camara Ive always had an iphone my fiance introduced me to his Galaxy Note 4 and ever since I wanted to switch I finally got the opportunity when he surprised with this new S7 edge and I never want to turn back I have the att variant and I love it Great display great features love the Edge features My only gripe is the device I purchased it suffering from horrible battery drain My Android system gets up to above 50 and my average screen on time is less than 2 hours with 8 hours of the charger in total

I also work at an att retail store and have come across this problem with a couple edges so far This phone has a look of great features Samsung has improved they apps quite a bit  Also glad the speaker is not on the back of the phone I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy S Advance and I am very happy with the huge increase in quality The camera is fantastic I am amazed that it can take 4k pictures the edge screen SHealth app and all the related heart rate stuff  and the fact that the screen uses Gorilla Glass 4 have truly blown me away To top it all off it is compatible with Gear VR which is one more reason that it functions a a hub for everything I could want to do with a phone The settings really cover everything too and after I set it up it has been a pleasure to use I have no doubts that this is the best phone available on the market What I love about my phone is
The clarity of the screen resolution
The Samsung pay capability
The speaker being on the bottom edge of the phone so I dont have to prop it up to keep from muffling sound
The amplified crystal clear sound
I simply love this phone

So far the only things I dont love about my phone are
Its kind of hard to hold onto because it is very slippery making it frustrating for taking selfies without a stick
The edge of the screen is slightly raised and I keep accidentally tapping things because I have large hands
The headphone jack is on the bottom next to the charge port

All in all I am super happy with this phone I love the speed that this phone works Getting videos and throwing video from phone to my smart TV is a dream

I normally would never spend this much on a phone but this was well worth the cost The galaxy S7 edge is the best I love this phone The features are great and the camera is out of this world I recommend this to anyone Battery life could be a bit better but there are ways to combat that Overall good phone Ive had my edge for about two weeks and it is incredible The colors that the screen is able to reproduce is nothing short of having another pair of eyes Super fast performance the latest Android OS expandable memory all make this phone a must have

Combined with the GearVR the phone enters another level of coolness I upgraded from the S5 so I could give my daughter my old phone The S7 charges much faster It is lighter weight The camera is slightly better It is hard to improve on the S5 camera which was very good It loads a bit faster It has great color and resolution There are some changes I am getting used to One of my email accounts works differently Instead of sliding a message I dont want to open to hit delete I now have to hold it down until the box in front opens then check it then check delete Or I can open it and click delete Both ways are more time consuming Im sure I will get used to it eventually I love the S7 Edge Has great features n great camera I love having Samsung Pay makes paying so easy First the battery life is incredible compared to other galaxy phones Ive used The screen is the perfect size The edges took time to adjust to but Ive fallen in love with the convenience The S health features were an unexpected find on this phone The cost of the phone seems much less now that I dont need to purchase a fit bit type watch to track my steps and monitor my fitness When I got my hands on the device it was to different in a good way Better grip better performance better pictures better overall I absolutely love this phone I recently swapped from an iPhone and I really like the fact that I decided to make the change The phone isnt difficult to operate as people claimed I wouldnt go back to iPhone software to save my life THIS PHONE HAS AN AMAZING PICTURE AN VIDEO THE FACT THAT IT IS WATERPROOF IS A NICE FEATURE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT GETTING WET AND DESTROYING THE PHONE ALSO THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ADD MORE MEMORY IS A GREAT ADDITION THERE WERE MANY THINGS ADDED THAT WERE NOT ON THE S6 EDGE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE PHONE VERY CUTTING EDGE Everything I ever had Samsung was great and theyre keeping the tradition going Really nice phone
Better then I Phone 

Great battery life crystal clear camera looks good I got this phone to replace my GS5 and I love it so far I held out for it instead of getting the S6 because I need a waterproof phone and an SD slot There are two main gripes I have relating to performance and design 

Starting with performance TouchWiz is still on board and slows things down so bad Its got great features that a lot of other launchers dont have so I cant go with Nova or Google launchers but there HAS to be a way to make it less resource intensive 2 weeks in and its kind of laggy Not bad mind you This phone is powerful but its stuff people like me with a trained eye for tech performance will inevitably notice Id give performance 45 stars if I could This phone does handle apps and tasks like a pro loading everything insanely fast Plus it can connect a call faster than I thought possible The actual call will be ringing before it even chimes that its connected 

I gave design 5 stars because it looks and feels amazing BUT I do have to say its very slippery and the touch screen is almost too sensitive Sometimes it registers things my finger is still hovering over Probably just something to get used to Sometimes the edges will register touch from your palm too Again probably something I just need to get used to Since these are probably just user error I gave it 5 on design I challenge someone to find me a sleeker sexier phone than this one

Otherwise this thing is incredible and people have been very complimentary which is really cool Seriously though the camera the battery the screen you name it it excels in it I must admit I was a bit hesitate to get this phone since I had always had the Note but I was impressed The only issue with the phone is that the edge feeds are hard to initialize and they only appear during sleep mode and that is only after you swipe to get them to appear Now if I have to swipe to make them appear I might as well look at them from my device All in all I love the size color and speed of the device its a must have I like the phone a great deal I got the edge version for the bigger battery The edge aspect is not useful and although I have not turned it off Im thinking about it The curved screen is a little weird on the edges because some of your apps will have things to select right on the curve If Samsung had offered the non edge version with the same size battery I would have gone for it instead That being said the phone is fast and with me using it all day including calls emails games movies wifi hot spot and music I use it for hours on an airplane the battery will last all day with no issues I have been using Galaxy devices for some years now and I will continue to do so because of the amazing Innovative products they continue to come out with The S7 is a great phone I like the ability to have multiple bluetooth devices hooked up at once I can have my headset car stereo and another device hooked up Ialso lije the feature if you have two calls and one you need to hang up on and you accidently hit more like do it out of habit the end button it just switches back to the other caller I keep finding features that i always have wished for on this phone The down side is the glass type back very fragile The glass scratches quite easily too Other than those two downers great phone My last phone was the Droid turbo and the galaxy s7 is a lot better Its fast and runs smooth I like the fingerprint scan safety features Call quality is very clear and Im looking forward to enjoying the gear vr Best phone on the market right now This phone is great I went from the S6 to the S7 and I love it Super easy transition too I recently went from the S5 to the S7 Edge and absolutely love it The phone is smooth and fluid in function and ha amazing battery life Oh and the VR Goggles are the icing on the cake The phone is worth the money Love the features Excellent Glad that I got this phone I like the design and it is easy to use Great featureswater resistance and lots and lots of storage Very happy with my galaxy S7 it has a long battery life charges lightning fast with the fast charging cable it came with and the camera performance is superb I have only had this for 2 weeks and its so much better than my 5s was I highly recommend the upgrade to this 7s Edge screen makes screen prone to cracking as mine cracked the first time I dropped it Samsung pay is simple to use but powerful I am notified for each transaction whether or not I use Samsung pay or swipe The app saves the store amount and date Great screen fast processor and miltiscreen Pricey but worth every penny I cant think of anything bad to say about this phone The clarity of the screen continues to be impeccable and unbeatable by other brands All of the apps I use run smoothly and effortlessly The quality of the pictures and videos are amazing Ive gotten a bunch of compliments on the pictures I sent to family and friends Everyone says the pictures look like I took them with a professional camera not a phone The zoom for both pictures and videos still amazes me As for some of the new features who can argue with having a phone thats water resistant The larger battery is a plus especially for someone like me who uses their phone a lot Being able to add more storage space is a huge plus as well I tend to have a ton of pictures videos and music on my phone so I need all the storage space I can get Another perk was being able to transfer all of my contacts files apps etc from my old phone to my new phone without having to download any new apps hook it up to my laptop use the cloud or anything of the sort A quick attachment of the adapter which is included plug in both phones to each other and the easy and fast prompts got everything done without any effort This is a great looking phone with great sound quality The only problem I have found is when I use my aux cable in my car it plays static when i pause music I upgraded from the S4 and I am in Love There are a few features I miss from my old phone but I will make due The battery life is a bit of a problem but I am still figuring out how to manage that issue I am a photographer and the professional feature on the camera is going to be of great use The pictures are amazing the colors are Bold and Beautiful The sound quality is a plus and I really like the Do Not Disturb feature I am pleased that I choose this phone All in all this is proving to be a great decision Does everything feels just right Samsung did it Premium experience delivered I have had this phone a little over 3 weeks I bought it as an upgrade from the Galaxy S4 mini and wasnt certain how I would like a big phoneLOVE IT I absolutely love the mechanismell of this phone This put my computer and tablet to shame Great phone as it can do just about anything you can imaging My only small issue is that it seems to be slippery in my hands thus Im conscience of how I hold or handle the phone as Im afraid of enablingdisabling something I didnt mean to or it falling out my hands trying to pick it up Bought this to replace water damaged Note 3 Love it Water resistant quick access edge menus great battery life crystal clear phone calls and fast response to key presses And fantastic pictures I highly recommend When you think what this S7 can do its amazingExcellent quilaty I love my new galaxy s7 edge Easy to find and use apps And its best feature is its water resistance which come in handy when yhe kiss are evolved After searching through the seemingly endless reviews of phones I decided to go get the s7 I was not disappointed at all after getting used to the phone First thing I noticed was the graphics They are incredibly sharp and I never noticed a flaw Gaming on this phone is amazing and I have been very pleased There are many options with this phone which I was happy with The only flaw which to me is not a big deal is the front facing camera The quality is lacking but like I said I dont use it much if at all Our family has had galaxy phones for the last 5 years This phone I absolutely love it has ease of access to a lot of apps The camera I love I dont even need to use my Sony camera anymore I originally bought the s7 and returned it after 2 weeks and bought the s7 edge which Im so happy I did because I love it twice as much Im going to get my husband and son one also I also talked my sister into getting one I should be a rep for Samsung I would highly recommend any Samsung product Everything I expected and moreVery simple to use super fast and great photos First time Ive bought a high end phone The size is just right for me and the clarity speed battery stay time are all above what I expected Simply put this is a great phone and Im really glad I got it Definetely an upgrade to the S5 or s6 Wouldnt have bought it without the SD card slot Nothing much special and different but still better than others I have found no flaws in this phone by itself Easy to use Easy to organize your apps Comfortable in the hand And plenty of features to help out with your needs I only have found one con And thato if you want a screen protector it doesnt cover the entire screen The sides of the phone are ever so slightly curved So the protector can not cover the curved portion of the screen Which isnt bad Just when you are playing a game with the screen sideways you can not easily look at the notification center with a case on the phone But other than that one subjective con the phone is flawless Its easy to use battery life is longer than I expected Touch screen is good it responds immediately The camera works great Video chat works great I was using an iPhone for 8 years an I decided to give a chance to samsung and I feel like I was in jail for long time because with my new Samsung Galaxy s7 I can feel the freedom in too many ways I love everything about this phone The edge is so convenient for get to just what you need The themes are a great new touch to customize your phone and the camera takes must better quality pictures Keep up the great work Samsung You only get better I upgraded from the Samsung S5 to the S7 and i am so happy with it the screen is pretty compariable to the S5 but the camera is much better i love it i bought the gold and it such a cool looking phone This Phone is a breeze what a seamless operating system I NEVER have to wait for anything Thank you for putting out an incredible product with the Best Camera on the Market My chubby short fingers can Navigate anywhere on the screen with minimal effort 
Thanks Again HH Great phone Unfortunately will not allow for silent calendar notifications If you select silent it keeps giving you on time This phone is great co pared to my old 4 I just wish sound was louder for steaming viedos and music I havent put my phone down for more than one hour since I got it besides learning more about it it connects to the Internet so much faster than the Galaxy 5 Im very pleased with this phone Ive always been a fan of the Galaxy line After I got my S3 some years ago I knew I would never go back But the Galaxy S7 is more than just the latest Galaxy phone Its the latest PHONE It has the most useful features of any phone Ive ever encountered Not just a bunch of gimmicky stuff I know Ill never use It includes top noch features for gaming on my device split screen viewing of apps and the best camera quality Ive ever seen on a cell phone I was so blown away by how loud the external speakers could get I almost thought it was broken Not to mention Samsung Pay is an extremely convenient tool The S7 is so fast it hasnt hung up or lagged on anything yet let alone crashed The touchscreen is beautifully sensitive and the fingerprint and heartrate sensors have worked great so far The battery life has lasted me all day long with almost continuous use upon waking and the alwayson display that presents the date and time is a blessing I never knew I needed Im not sure how Samsung will ever beat this but Im going to stick around to find out I left Samsung last year when the phones did not have expandable memory and I hated my phone for that long The new version of touchwiz is very nice I have had 4 Galaxy phones and have loved them all but this one is the best The battery life is no were they say it should last Im trying everything to get longer life nothing Sims to work but Ultra power saving mod I wish I knew this before hand I might not of got the phone My Samsung Galaxy S7 is very fast and manages to impress me everytime I use it I am very glad that it is water resistant because my S6 edge got ruined in waterThe only con is that the camera megapixels should be better i liked the old setup for the camera settings that was on the S4 The battery life is amazing I have a smart watch connected to it and I am always on my phone all day and the battery is at 30  by the end of the day The pictures are still very clear and the new technology in the camera is very impressive Ive always owned the flagship phones and this is by far the best phone Ive owned Went from the S6 Edge to the S7 Edge and the small differences played a big role in why I think this phone is far more superior than any phone Ive owned 

Although I like bigger phones which is why I went with the S6 Edge when it came out the S7 Edge is slightly smaller but Im okay with it Android 60 is so smooth and the feel of the phone adds to how sleek it is I started using the Edge features even more with the newly added features compared to the S6 Edge Also the black model I went with really made the phone look clean and simple 

Along with the display camera and many other features Android 60 included I highly recommend this phone to anyone thats looking for a welldesigned phone with great performance Definitely worth the money The phone is super cool Its fast Oh and the fast charge is just amazing

If youre looking for android smart phone Id recommend getting the S7 The Galaxy S7 sets the platform in quality The overall build and features is the heard voice of the consumer From entrepreneurs to every day users this product meets the needs and want of the customer I love how the edge screen design and how it feels in the hand Water proof and expendable storage make me get this phone but overall i am loving it I wish samsung would introduce another UI other then touchwiz but I still like the fact that this S7 edge is super fast phone with no lag so far and fast charging is superb Wireless fast charging even makes it so much easier in daily routines Overall its a fantastic phone and i gave 5 stars to samsung for coming up with this sleek design and powerful phone You guys really listen to your customers Built in speakers are not up to par thought it would be just as load or loader than the galaxy note speakers Very durable especially the screen it easily wipes of finger print on the screen with smudging the phone is very user friendly easily access pages and apps im glad i chose this phone I have had nothing but problem with this phone It freaks out I got my phone on March 15th and a week and a day later I had to take it back because I had to charge my phone 2 to 3 times in a day Now twice with this phone it will just randomly open an app and it will keep opening it when you get out of it Or it will go into my text messages and keep typing letters  Thank god it has never sent any messages The S7 Edge is absolutely the best phone Ive own by far I love the sleek style of the Edge and the resolution is crisp and clear on all my photos I like the palm option to take a quick picture I have lost several phones to water damage I am please that this phone is water proof to some extent The S7 Edge is fast and reliable Thank you Samsung I have to use my camera and video daily for work and the quality on the s7 is incredible 
Quick shots even in motion coemail out looking very clear and detailed The zoom is very close and clear as well I love that even in low light the quality is very good Since being an android user for the last 5 years there is no question that Samsung continues to not only dominate the television market but have created superior phones which Apple have tried to imitate with their Iphones and still dont come close With itsunami sleek design fast operating system and numerous array of apps the Galaxy 7 has shown to be superior product and has become the MercedesBenz of the phone industry This phone is faster lasts longer and is versatile This phone lives up to everything Samsung wanted it to be It has a beautiful display fits great in your hands and does not disappoint in performance I had an S6 and was hesitant to upgrade Believe me it was well worth the switch I liked my S6 but did have some beefs with it like the battery life and other small things The S7 edge is a great upgrade with the battery life along with processing power I love this phone and am kind of excited to see how Samsung is going to out do this phone I upgraded from the S5 It was a smooth transition because the phones are so similar I really like the NFC feature and the themesskins that are available The burst photo feature in the camera is great too The only downside is that its heavier than the previous phone which I dont like for running Im going to try the Gear Watch I think to make running tracking more comfortable I love it  The only thing I would change would be the size I like a little bigger screen I just upgraded from the S6 Edge to the S7 and the speed on this phone is GREAT It performs very fast and the camera is really good I was nervous with going from a 16 MP camera to a 12MP but my pictures come out wonderful The camera really does take awesome pictures in low light I love having my memory card option back Overall I am very satisfied with this phone I love my new S7 I have had it for a few weeks now It charges a quickly and maintains a long battery life It is so fast easy to use I love that it supports a large external SD card so I can put all my music and my HD picturesvideo and know they are safe and not slowing down my phone The display is bright and the setup is customized so all my favorite features are accessed in just a few steps 3 Samsung Since I have a Samsung TV and sound bar everything talks to each other so its super easy to switch devices I absolutely adore this phone the only thing is the curve sometimes using 1 hand to text it wont recognize the number 1 other then that I live the phone the design is very pretty as well as the features My wife and I have had various Samsung phones over the years and really thought Samsung hit it out of the park when we got our S5 We thought that this would be our last phone for a while but instead they just keep improving and getting better with every release

We just traded our Galaxy Note Edge phones for the S7 edge and could not be more happy The performance has been vastly increased and even the battery life is longer than before

We would also like to thank Samsung for bringing back the use of the Micro SD card slot as this was something that we really missed 

You guys not only hit it out of the park with the S7 but I would even say the Galaxy

Thanks Samsung Keep up the great work Must have phone The features are easy to use and great for the modern user Great size fast as lightning save and secure This is my 3rd Samsung phone after having several iPhones Pretty much can guarantee any electronic devices I buy will be a Samsung I havent had any problems with this phone Extremely quick and reliable Perfect design just right screen size blazing fast extra storage without extra size unlike other companies extraordinary camera best in the market Excellent features including always on display Waterproof Latest android os This phone is EVERYTHING a smart phone should be Smooth and reliable feels great in the hand Its the best Samsung yet and Im really happy with the performance The camera is just what I wanted and I cant wait for the accessories Anyone looking for a new phone  this is it I am enjoying this phone They have really sped things up on this phone I mean things run fast its super responsive Also the high speed charging is great The phone is a nice size Smaller than my old Galaxy S5 I wasnt sure Id want to go down in size but now I think its a great size The phone feels nice with the glass on the front and back However I dont benefit from the feel of it much because the fact that I know its all glass inspired me to buy a good protective case for it As someone who is fairly active and spends a lot of time fishing or around water in general the waterproof feature is a valuable feature for me I know it cant go too deep or be in water for too long but its enough to protect the phone from a dunk in the water or a downpour This phone is the bomb Reminds me of my evo way back when Only issues Ive had was with wifi and that got fixed really quickly Three times now the power button and volume lowering button have completely stopped working The first time this happened I took my phone in and exchanged it for a brand new one I had only had the original phone for 4 days After exchanging my phone the new one has also had this same issue of the power button and lower volume button completely stopping working The only solution I have found to fix this is to wait until your phone runs out of battery since you cant use the power button to restart it and then once you plug it into the charger and hold the power button down it works again I have only had this second new phone for a week now and honestly I cant believe I got two lemon phones with the exact same issue and I think it is a flaw within the phone itself so I decided not to bother with exchanging it again and having to completely reset it up again I considered switching to the Edge but I have a friend who said her son is having the same issue with his 7 Edge I really like the phone overall but the power button working is kind of important especially since there is no other way to hard restart it other than draining it at least not that I am aware of I upgraded from the GS5 Better performance better application of the water resistant feature no more charging port cap the fingerprint reader is finally easy enough to use as my default lock Great new features Packs a bigger battery life into a smaller footprint Recommended to anyone Fast charging is a huge improvement Love the phone and features Looking forward to syncing s2 watch with it The S7 Edge is an amazing smartphone The screen is so far above anything else that it seems amazing The touch sensitivity is almost intuitive Battery lasts all day no matter what I use it for 

However the bloatware is invasive Specifically the Galaxy Apps that seem to continually update a file called Quicktools daily unless you disable it That is if you can find it 

AND THE BACK GLASS This phone was advertised to the public prior to its release as having Gorilla Glass on both sides of the phone I was really looking forward to having a beautiful phone that I could actually keep sans case since it was waterproof and had the double Gorilla glass Well I have seen both of the other people I know who own this phone break the back glass within days of purchase Both from small falls One to a carpeted surface So now my beautiful phone is all covered up in a case so it stays that way

All in all anight amazing product When Samsung decides to build the one it promises it will be the phone of a generation I like my phone Its got a great design combined with good performance I also like the screen display Its really a wonderfullphone to buy Amazing Perfect i love it the best ever You have to buy it I switched from iPhone to galaxy and its the best decision I could of made the phone is amazing The only thing that bothers me about my S7 is that the memory card option wasnt set up for ATT to be able to expand the onboard memory for operation I have a large MicroSD card thats also fast and cant get any real use out of it I feel the hardware is good The battery is subpar which is not entirely Samsungs fault but Android on a whole My battery depletes about 24 every ten minutes even if the display is off im not using it and battery saver is on with no apps running in the background I find that unacceptable Something has to be done with android and figure out why the battery life is horrible especially with such a large capacity battery 

The design of the Samsung software is too bloated They need to stick with a slicker layout and less bloatware Try offering a stock android version and Im sure youll sell a lot more 

I believe that there should be a simple layout but option to customize could use customizable LED notification light without using third party software 

I think there should be a toggle switch similar to the iphones mute toggle The android volume controls are too clunky id like the option to mute all and turn it to vibrate only with the flip of a switch and not needing to touch the screen or even turn it on My new S7 is great With every upgrade the phones get easier and faster to use Very happy with the features speed and ease of use Best phone ever its so fast and easy to use speaked sound amazing I am very disappointed that there are no tempered glass protectors that cover the WHOLE screenedge to edgecorner to corner Poor planning The phone first and foremost is gorgeous A bit more sturdy feeling without drawing away from the appearance All the goodies that come with android and access to VR with actually good quality Ultra power saver mode makes me feel like Im looking at a Mr game and watch menu which is hilarious Battery life is about two days in use and and almost a week in ultra power saver I positively love this phone a whole new world of computer in your pocket Coming from the Note series phones the S7 was the perfect size and weight The build quality is the best I have see in a smartphone yet and the software features provide sufficient ability to customize the UI to my liking I love this new phone its fast and meets all my needs My favorite feature is the camera Itso by far the b3st camera Ive used in a phone Great job samsung I upgraded from a S6 Edge to the S7 Edge and Im so glad I did This phone is great and the little things I dont like about the phone are exactly that little things

What I like
great battery life Omg I can go the whole day without needing to charge With my old S6 Edge that was a huge issue I had to charge it mid day sometimes even twice a day The new S7 Edges battery life is great even with playing games I can go most of the day without having to charge it
display is gorgeousbut the S6 Edges display is also just as beautiful so not really an upgrade on that front but just as good
the design on the S7 Edgeis more polished than the S6 Edge The metal around the screen on the S6 edge stuck out more I want to say it was sharper But on the S7 Edge its more rounded and feels more flush with the glass screen A definite plus
new edge features are great its a small update and the update will probably end up getting to the S6 Edge The added options of more apps and more feeds is good
expandable memoryyes definitely a plus
oh and the AOD always on display is a great feature I love to just be able to take a glance of my phone as Im passing it to see what the time is and if I had any missed calls or texts very nice
and all the new features with Android Marshmallow are great
Im sure Im missing a bunch more things I love about this phone but those are the main thingsnow some things that are just me being picky

the camera is great but it was also great on the S6 EdgeI know technically its supposed to be a better cameralets more light inbetter in low lightBUT in all honesty I cant tell much difference in picture quality compared to the S6 Edge 
the edge screen is more sensitive I find when I text my hand will accidentally hit letters that are along the outer edge I didnt have this problem with my S6 Edge so thinking the edge screen is just more sensitive on the S7 Edge 


Hope this helps anyone considering the S7 EdgeI enjoy the phone I upgraded from an iPhone 6Plus to the Galaxy S7 and its truly a night and day experience I would recommend to any iPhone fan out there to checkout the Galaxy S7 its a great phone Ive been an iPhone user for 6 years this is the best phone ever My favorite 2 features are the camera and Samsung pay 
Everything is so good its hard to point out any one thing 
Thank you Samsung Overall so far its been a great phone Fast great features and very nice design If it had a removable batterie and USB type C connector it would be perfect The phone is great however The headphone jack should be on the top not the bottom Camera much improved reliable and fast cant work the notification scrolling panel Very happy with new product Still using all the same systems as the older Samsung Battery is better MUCH more intuitive and easy to use for midlevel users and still LOTS of UI tweaks available for more powerful users LOVE the camera and the display lots of little nuance stuff youll dig I recently upgraded from the S4 to this S7  Im loving my phone so far The battery is great I love the style  durability of the phone The features are the same  there are a couple new features that I think are great The always on display being able to transfer files  messages between your old device  your new one themes for your phone  being able to make ring tones from your music The only thing I miss in my S4 is the IR blaster I love just about everything about this phone Plus the vr capabilities are impressive for a phone Phone is fast Sleek and wows everybody I show it to The pictures are sharp and the screen crisp Great usage throughout the day Battery is very good and holds up though calls email internet and also games Have not ran the battery down through the day yet Love my new phoneupgraded from the S5 and have foudn it much easier to handle and noticed that the battery life lasts longer the supercharge battery is also very quick to charge Great pictures too Although it was not perfect I was a big fan of the Galaxy S6 Beautiful screen fast processor nice design excellent cameragreat phone overall The one thing I wasnt crazy about was the battery life Im not a demanding user by any stretch but that phone struggled to get through the day Although fastcharging helped it wasnt fun being afraid the phone would die on me at any time I always felt like I had to carry a backup charger So when I heard about the design and features of the S7 I was very excited Number one for me was the larger capacity battery but I was also glad to hear about the water resistance and other upgrades like the expandable memory better lowlight camera and AOD None of these was earthshattering but all were solid improvements albeit incremental in some instances At first I hesitated since I had to buy out my contract and surrender the old phone but after some consideration I decided to take the plunge Its been several weeks now and the decision has worked out very well Im pleased to say I really liked my S6 but I love the S7 Its everything I need and then some Its handled everything Ive thrown at it without a stutter The battery seems to last forever and the other new or improved features deliver as promised Im very happy and strongly recommend it to anyone in the market Whether to upgrade from the S6 is a personal decision but I certainly dont regret it As usual Samsung has knocked it out of the parkThis is the best phone Ive ever hadI had a S3 and this is light years betterHail the S7 This product has an excellent camera Great features Sleek design and works for everything I replaced my S5 with the S7 I like the ability to add the memory card for storing media My only complaint is that I loved the replaceable battery on the S5 but the phone feels solid and well put together with great materials I put it into a standard case with a lip to protect the screen so the back material is only important in that the wireless charging works better than the charging back from the S5 Performance is great and stable Works with my Samsung watch better than the S5 Always on screen is something you dont think you need but once you have it you will need it 

This has been a great upgrade I wish they would have sold versions with expansion memory and more internal memory but that is just being finicky I previously had a Galaxy S5 and after two years Ive decided that the S7 Edge is right phone for me The phone is noticeably larger but the curved design still makes it easy to hold in one hand The camera pixel numbers are lower yet the camera still takes amazing pictures and video up to 4K quality I get to keep using the 32GB SD card on this phone to store more of those quality photos One of the minor things I dont like is that its kind of slippery The glass back is beautiful to look at so I got a clear case to still show it off Problem solved I guess Slim very slim nice contour very fast and responsive Always fan of Samsung since sg2 This phone is a great device Samsung is the best Im new to Samsung phones but I can already say this wont be my last Its everything you look for in a device Super fast charge that lasts great and easy photos enough memory to keep all you need in one place You really cant go wrong I have not found anything that I do not love about my new phone I owned a Galaxy S5 prior to buying the S7 I feel that Ive wasted my money Yes it takes pictures faster Thats about the only noticeable new feature Quite a disappointment This phone loses charge I switched from an iphone to Samsung and am constantly having to charge this phone The display is beautiful its one handed use is comfortable Im enjoying learning everything about it This is the best phone I have ever had Im a big fan of photography so the enhanced camera with pro mode is one of my favorite features I wish there was more built in memory but I have a 200GB MicroSD cardo inside so Imay in love with the expandable storage The rounded back feels a lot better than the feel of the Galaxy S6 Edge Last but certainly not least the WATERPROOFING I have yet to drop my phone in water but its amazing that I can do so without worrying The blazing fast speed is an incredible upgrade but I believe thats somewhat due to Marshmallow All around amazing phone that I would recommend to EVERYONE I havent had this phone for long but so far Im loving it Pictures are very clear If you have short fingers trying to use it with one hand can be troublesome as your palm will touch the edge of the screen but other than that I have no complaints Love my edge cant wait to get my gear vr its got to be the bomb cause the phone is sweet Great phone Looks great Would recommend to friends Samsung is the best This phone is a great improvement to my last few models
Pros
Responsive screen work quickly and I dont have to press hard to get the crew neck to react
Camera takes beautiful photos and has a lot of fun modes 
Ability to add storage Im pretty hard on electronics so having somewhere on the phone to store important documents and photos on a card is a must
VR capable lots of fun to mess around with
Cons
With the case on my phone is a bit bigger then I would like but workablend
There is no greyscale option that I have found yet I liked this on the s5 because it would make the screen a tab bit dimmer at night so I didnt disturb my partner as much while reading in bed The new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is one of the best products to come out it stands out from the rest of the the phones to come out the curve on the edge of the screen allows you to use the phone more smoothly it is inexpensive and has a beautiful bright display the the speakers have incredible sound quality its also very light and durable design and concept of the Samsung Galaxy S 7 Edge is beautiful the glass all over it makes it stand out The video is by far the best and the audio is much better than the rest I had a note 5 with tons of games and upgraded to the S7 Edge and it wont play my games at all Its like a slide show and lots of of paid apps I cant play So Im going back to my old note 5 phone Other than the issues playing my games and a few other apps
The S7 edge phone is a great product for pictures and other features I do like the phone and coming from Android 4x definitely a step up Nice screen nice camera overall I am happy
However the fast wireless charging stopped working it worked initially but after what I assume are some updates the phone no longer fast charges wirelessly still via wired connection though A little disappointing but I guess one cant have everything Holds good battery life many features not to mention water proof Going from my 3 year old Galaxy S4 Active to the Galaxy S7 has been a fantastic experience I waited and extra year to upgrade looking for all the fantastic features offered with the S7 I was looking for battery life removable SD card the lastest operating system design and so much more I read every review of what was likely to be part of the new design and they didnt lie it is a great phone and Im a very happy owner Now back to the manual to continue to learn all the things this phone has to offer The phone would be great if it wasnt stuffed with as always too much undeletable bloatware Very fast and lots of features and also a very crisp picture and camera Beautiful It is truly wonderful Good storage space and battery life I love all Samsung products Im a Samsung guy The features for screen mirroring allows me to view and give a better presentations to my friends and family either watching movies or Sharing photos Another great feature is the edge viewing I set my time for a certain time to display instead of having to turn the phone on Thats just the peak of things u can do with the power of Samsung I upgraded to the S7 from S5 I love the feel of the S7 Im so glad that I got rid of my IPhone Thank you Samsung for designing the S7 My husband has the S7 edge We are never going back to the IPhone Great pics excellent performance easy to use slim sleek and great battery life I love how the features of the s7 are the same as the Samsung tablet I have I dont have to learn how to use yet another device This is a greal phone This phone has lived up to the hype Ive had no issues with it so far The camera is excellent great detail and very fast The camera itself has many cool features overall this phone has been a great release It is very slick rich and great preforming The phone has great features I really like the brightness of the screen and take really nice bright picture The Samsung pay is nice and easy to use You can get all kinds of news and info of this phone The only think I really wish I would of done is get the Samsung S7 edge But they were out when I went back for one But I really do like my Samsung S7 and all the things it can do This is my first Samsung phone and I saw the pre launch write ups and went to the store to look at the new phone I was impressed with the features and design I am always learning something new about the phone as I am a bit of a dinosaur with advanced electronics I have had this phone for about 2weeks and I have had no problems with the features or performance so far so good Considering I upgraded from a much smaller and outdated phone as far as technology this phone has also been really easy to use I have had no troubles trying to figure out how to use this phone I like the look of the phone as well and the cameraso many things you can do with it and the pictures come out very well I also like that you have the capability to expand the memory I love Samsung Galaxy phones and I have had the S3 S4 S5 and now S7 One thing that could be viewed as good or bad is they are all generally the same Have mostly the same features they just improve slightly in different areas each time
I love that this phone has wireless charging I dont have to worry about my daughter ruining the charging port from yanking the phone around while its attached to the charger Also having a water proof phone is awesome havent had it encounter any water yet though
I did notice when I first was using the phone without a case that it was sort of hot which is strange Also the Facebook app frequently has trouble on this phone but not my galaxy S5 it always says something like connecting to server even when it has full bars of 4G Also I use amazon prime music and unless I download the song to my phone it usually wont stream an entire song without freezing multiple times Instagram freezes often as well None of these problems I have had on any of my other galaxy phones before with the same apps This product has all of the power and speed to handle any task yet still sport a stunning eye catching design A truly Stylish Super Smart device that takes full advantage of the new Android OS Best galaxy yet The phone has a great battery and size I have been a Samsung customer for MANY years for many different products for a reason they make quality items I had a Note 3 and other than being able to swipe both directions on the home screen and the size difference of the phones Im over the moon for the new S7 Im super stoked about the increase in MP for the cameras as well  with the selfies my daughter and I take together its nice to have more clarity on the end results The screen resolution itself seems more clear as well and the speakers have a much better volume for playing music  on the Note 3 I didnt hear so well on them I upgraded from a GS5 this month and couldnt be happier The phone is super easy to setup and use The battery life is great 12 hours with constant use The picture quality in the screen is very good as well Very glad I upgraded when I did Its beautifully desing the camera takes amazing good quality photos Is fast fits your pocket Besides it can handle places like the beach or hiking This is the best phone Ive ever had Im still learning stuff about it but has great pictures and videos and would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a new phoneTankle you so much for the new phone I change my Galaxy 3 for this one Camera in Galaxy S7 is great with incredible graphics would be nice to be able to order cases for the product and have apps that are updated before te product comes out I like the edge features and how you are able to view contactsome even when the off is off Went from the s5 active to the s7 egde Does not disappoint The edge display is a nice feature to have Battery life is great Amazing overall Great design Great features stylish design Overall best phone Ive ever owned I absolutely love the Galaxy s7 edge it is definitely the best phone I have ever owned before Just the word galaxy labeling a phone explains it for the most part Id have to say all the Galaxy phones have all been amazing phones and the new s7 edge tops the list I honestly have no complaints about the phone and Ive had it for a couple weeks now Great design but since I got the phone it crashes all day whenever the IHEART radio App is playing for no reason it crashes and restarts sometimes knocking out my lock wallpaper and always on clock display the email and text delay send message feature is gone which was big for me when you want to close all apps that are running you cant you have to go into setting and find Applications and do a Force stop so aggravating I dont see the talk and text feature for sending a text using the microphone the new design have moved it from text keyboard area but the phone is very fast the camera is awesome along with the effects you can do with the pictures editing I love this phone Upgraded from the Galaxy 5 skipping the 6 because it did not have the external memory feature Love the ease of the edge technology and the VR is ridiculously addicting I love this phone computer camera organizerreminder and storage device I am almost 70 and experiencing some vision problems due to retina repairs in both eyes  The brightness and sharpness of the display has really helped me Also I am not the most tech savvy senior citizen but the S7 has a lot of built in guides to assist me Every day l learn more of what the S7 can do The almost limitless storage means I can show off my photos of the grand kids until I have bored everyone a church and the senior center Ian also using Samsung pay A great convienince My s7 edge seems to have a lot of glitches It freezes and doesnt work properly The S7 Edge is a great phone Designwise I just wish it had a removable battery but over all its a great phone with little or no issues I had the galaxy 6 it was awesome but the galaxy 7 took it to another level of greatness The camera is definitely top notch Slim and great size to carry inside my wristlets As I compare this phone with my last one I had which was the Galaxy 6 There is no comparison to the Galaxy 7 It has all the features that you would need and more The speed the quick connection to people or sites is not compatible to the Galaxy 6 It would be very hard for any other too beat this product Itll be a very long time for any one to come close to it by then Samsung will have a new and better product I like this phone better than any IPhone this is one tough device and everything right at your fingertips Overall very impressed The phone is really great but performance at times are a little slow It is still faster with downloads and screen changes but when you type sometimes it lags a bit Another problem I have is with the edge its annoying when you are using the phone with one hand and your palm touches it so what you are pressing doesnt register Other than that I love the clear display and the beautiful camera Everything just looks clearer and more beautiful on the screen The camera has an aperture feature so it makes taking photographs more fun to take Im quite happy with my phone I really like the new features I can even control my TV from the phone I like that direct TV access but the video is poor This is a great phone with a tremendous amount of features My only issue is the price which happens to be one of the most expensive out there Other than the price its a great phone Great phone is slim fast and water proof  Keep up the great job Samsung Great phone works well and love the fact that it has expandable memory and waterproof I am still trying to figure it all out But so far I am loving it Everything works great so far Camera is awesome I especially love the color and the design Mine is a gold one I have been 100 satisfied with my Samsung s7edge as Im learning more and more on it just continues to get even better And will I recommend friends and family to purchase this same phone yes I have and will continue to do so again thank you Samsung for such a great phone and experience Having had the Samsung S6 I love this new version It takes some getting used to but definitely a good device to have This is the smartest smart phone I have owned It is fast  has great battery life This phone is amazing Looks great  the edge screen is very handy Fast launch of apps Camera is great I have had the phone for about a couple of weeks and I cant put it down Just installed the Good Lock app from Samsung and to me it really adds more functionality Overall I am really impressed with the quality and build of the S7 Edge The S7 edge is a a great preforming phone feels great in my hand Fast and smooth I loved the idea of the edge but its just too big and awkward No sense to have a cool nonuser friendly phone The edge features were just not enough to get me back to 2 hand typing again Plus theres not a good way to fully protect the device The S7 is my choice hands up Feels like they solved a lot of issues from the past Great phone so far I like the sleek style Seems to be very good quality The battery life and charge time is extremely good Very pleased The galaxy s7 has been a great phone so far the only complaints i have are the battery life it will last all day if you arent using it but watching videos and playing games will run it dead fast my other complaint is Ithat doesnt have the capability to talk and use data at the same time us cellular told me this phone does not support it other than that it is a great phone I love how vivid the colors on the screen The front camera is great even in low light areas The s7 is by far the most superior phone on the market Packed with features and great performance Ive had every galaxy device and love them all I love the battery life of my Samsung S7 and love getting a great deal from my local dealer I love all the Samsung Galaxys I have ever had and this is no different Theven picture quality is our this world The battery life is great But what I love most about this phone is that the removable memory is back And the fact it can be in water foe up to 30 minutes makes it the best Galaxy so far Thank you for listening Samsung This is a great device It is a powerhouse of form features and functions I am new to the edge design and have adapted to in quickly and easily I often use my device one handed and the edge menus make accessing what I want very easy without the worry of dropping my phone I am so glad Samsung returned to the expandable memory The phone is great all the way around Camera battery life  new featuresite makes it more awesome But Id recommend anymore to add more storage to the phone Love my new samsung galaxy edge7 Especially the edge features Just a quick glance and I can see whats going on Openthe edged and you can have all the features you use the most right there Simply the best phone zI have ever had When I got my new phone I was unable to send out texts or get my voicemail because of a faulty Sim card Verizon replaced it for free and I was good to go but now my phone will just shut down and reboot on its own Not to mention there are not that many differences in features other then the obvious water resistant then my old s4 I do like that it is water resistant and the camera takes nice pictures but other then that it is nothing to brag about I have not used the pay app because my bank is not compatible with it I do like Samsung phones and it is a nice phone just not brag worthy and already a headache Samsung really changed the game with the S7 in the previous versions the phones were loaded with useless Appshowever the S7 has been cleaned and streamlined with only the Apps you want or need I especially love the fact that the quality of pictures and Videos is Crystal clear and I look forward to further Samsung Galaxy Products Water resistant Expandable memory Big screen Fast charging Samsung Pay and many more features So many great options on the camera Its better than any regular camera Ive had I have had previous samsung phones and this one does top them all With its sleek design and the features it packs under the hood the phone is literally a beast I have had no trouble balancing numerous demanding apps but the battery life is still a little below par to me As I had an iPhone before I got the S7 and its battery lasted two days doing the same activities where this one will usually only last one Also so far I have seen a big improvement in the operating system as the touchwiz of yesteryear is pretty much gone and it just makes the phone seem smoother Overall I really have no complaints about the phone and recommend it to everyone as its features are one of a kind in the phone world This phone is amazing Great screen Great camera Finally samsung has put effort into the design and build of their premium device Again I state best phone ever made I love the fast start and fast photo taking features this phone has The picture quality is amazing I absolutely love the say cheese feature where when you have the front facing camera on and you say cheese the phone snaps the picture Amazing The sound quality during phone calls is perfect the clearest ever The only concern I have is teaching the keyboard to stop correcting every word  I recently upgraded to a Galaxy S7 and I love my new phone It is fast and the camera is amazing
I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is considering upgrading or changing phones I really enjoy my new phone I have upgraded from a note 3 and the improvements on speed and sound quality are awesome It may be operator error but the camera is not as good as I had hoped I went from a Samsung Galaxy III to a 7 It still doesnt work in my home so there are a lot of drop spots One of the biggest disappointments is that my text messages are coming in as not the correct contact It randomly selects another contact which is confusing on who is sending the text The suggested emojis dont come out correctly on other cell phones I recently upgraded to the Samsung S7 Edge from a LG G4 I love the speed screen and new features like Samsung Pay NFC and MTA I enjoy using my phone to pay for everything even if the location doesnt support mobile payment using the MTA technology that allows my phone to communicate with any magnetic strip reader It always takes the person off guard The battery is also excellent for a device with a screen this size Waterproof if a nice insurance policy Smaller than I expected but other than that it is GREAT I love this phone Camera is amazing I upgraded from an S5 to the S7 I can get over the increased speed Also I run 4 Bluetooth devices and its ability to switch between them is greater The picture is clearer and photos pop with the camera Very stable too I havent had any lock ups or anything That might be because the memory is twice the size of an S5

Once again Samsung sets the standard for all others to catch up to Good job The Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best phone out there I held on to my Galaxy S5 because of the water proof feature the S6 didnt have it When the S7 was announced I couldnt wait to upgrade Great design micro SD card slot bright display water proof not spill proof WATER PROOF great camera Overall this has been a great upgrade from my S5 The only small defect Ive noticed is some issues in loading pictures at times So far this seems like a nice phone Did a lot of research and it seems that the hype has been worth it so far but well see I like the phone its speed is amazing Although getting used to the switched home keys did mess with me a little The Samsung pay it working any were is awesome now if it could just work as my drivers license Ive had this phone for a couple of weeks now and there hasnt been anything I didnt like about it other than the price The camera is phenomenal I love how easy it is to use all the features on the phone I still am trying to figure everything outbut so far Ive had a blast with itI havent even received the occulus goggles yet My only complaint is probably my own faultI should just get some help with it but when I get home and it gets on my wifi it constantly sends me notification after notification nonstopI am sure this is simple to fix I adore the S7 Linked up with my Gear S2 my smart TVS everything The S7 is the fastest most useful phone Ive ever owned Interface is easy to organize and use The quality of the screen camera and sound are amazing I hope to be using this phone for many years Before upgrading to the Galaxy S7 I had a Galaxy S4 and I was not satisfied After about a year of using it it slowed down so much and lagged I was thinking hard about making the switch to an iPhone but kept on second thinking the thought When I finally upgraded I decided to give Samsung another chance before I actually went to iPhone I am so grateful that I did give them another chance The phone is amazing and the performance overall is just GREAT Aside from the little slippery feel when holding it without a case it is a great phonewaaaaay better than iPhone too I like that its water resistant and that it accepts an SD card for memory but I wish that they would have included the best feature from older versions like my GS5 has namely removable battery

 A real plus is the improvement that they made on the camera low light greatly improved and focus is almost instant great camera I love this phone it has many features that my other galaxy phones did not have The battery life is phenomenal This is the best phone I have had yet I could not be happier with my purchase The Galaxy is never a disappointment I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Active to the S7 Edge It is much faster the camera works better and the battery life is so much longer Love it As I patiently waited for my preorder It was the longest 8days ever And then they released it 4 days early I have spent the last two weeks learning and enjoying the new s7 I love the speedthe camera and most of all the 64g card plus 32g built in memory 
Thanks for listening to your fans and building what we all have been waiting for Im not good with technology but I love this phone Learning how do more stuff with my phone Love love love this phone Sexy looking in gold battery life is super just overall love it Android may have its faults but the Galaxy S7 Edge you forget them The speed is great and the screen is better than most 4k TVS I doubt any phone in the near future will ever be an upgrade compared to the S7 Edge I recently upgraded from the S6 edge Features are similar but better The expandable memory is something I missed from my S5 The camera is good an the sleek design is perfect I would recommend this phone to anyone who loves gadgets with a lot of features I love the S7 Its really pretty way better than my old plastic S5 I love the new features I can set up my own theme and change it whenever I want Ive only had the phone for 2 weeks and am already on my third theme I also love the always on display I can see the time without having to turn the phone on And the best part is the battery it is so much better I dont even need to take my charger with me anymore And it charges so quickly I love android processing systems the user friendly options and accessibility of a Droid device is something I prefer over any other system 
And with any Samsung Galaxy I found it everything I wanted in a phone Its fast sleek and does everything I need it to as fast as I need it to I love so many features of this phone Wireless charging great camera expandable memory etc My concern is that it has had a black screen issue and other boot software issue in the 2 weeks Ive had the phone Im concerned with these issues going forward and hope they are resolved quickly Features are great but dependability is most important while skiing in Lake Tahoe i was able to takes very realistic photos as well as videos the mic on my phone records very well of course its HD but it sounded good i am very happy Id made this purchase and of course i brag about it and will tell the next person they should have one as well

Thanks for the update Love the new S7 It exceeds what the others were and doesnt compare This phone is jam packed with awesome toys functions and features Samsung APS are cool I use S health to track my food throughout the day The outfacing camera took a drop in megapixels but the selfie camera has better clarity than S5 and fun additional functions Beautiful exterior and comfortable size I am a huge fan of power saving mode Cant wait to try the VR Gear

Downside is that Google voice is nonresponssive a lot and when using apps I get an error message about no connectivity This could be a Marshmallow issue though so I wont pin it to the phone faster not enough memory but good performanceI definitely recommend this product to everyone Best Samsung yet Fast thin and awesome battery life After having a Note phone I needed a smaller phone and this is perfect Very easy to use and handle without being bulky I love the Camera its the best Ive had on a phone easy to use and takes beautiful pictures I take pictures of my grandbabies and they dont hold still but with my S7 they dont need to
I have already recommended this phone to my friends and family Just upgraded from S4 to S7 Edge and I cant believe how happy I am Features are phenomenal as is the screen resolution I would recommend it highly This phone is a great concept to use I use it everyday and I am perfectly fine and proud to have it with I recommend to get this phone I have had this phone for about 2 weeks and I love it I have owned several galaxy phones and this is the best one yet Love that I dont need a million passwordspins  that I can just use my finger print Love that Im able to personalize it to my specifications and needs Love everything about the phone The quality of the camera is shockingly good it is so good it shows every detail or flaw Plus I have emojis now This is everything I wanted the S6 edge to be and now I have it Better battery life and a quicker fingerprint scanner are the noticeable features that affect my daily interaction with the product Love it  great product inexpensive easy to learn how to use Good Clarity on the phone Apps work good Excellent memory I was not too sure to buy this phone But im extremely glad i did Overall the phone is amazing the camera is phenomenal The handling is awesome Theres not enough to say about how amazing this phone is I love everything about it Started off rocky with the wifi issues but was very pleased with the speed of the fix Ive been an iPhone user since 2011 and the transition from iOS to android could not have been more comfortable than it was with my Galaxy S7 The battery on this thing easily gets me through my day The screen is amazing such beautiful colors and dark blacks are viewable in any lighting from indoors to midday outside But the thing that blows my mind above all else is the native ability to shoot RAW DNG photos and 4K video while being able to take advantage of expandable storage via the micro SD card I could not be any happier with this phone plain and simple The phone itself is the best phone Ive ever had but there were far too many applications from samsungVerizon that either duplicated functions done by other applications or just arent generally useful One notable exception is S health which is actually quite good The phone itself however is incredible

Bloat ware

Thats literally it The quality of pictures is amazing I love that it is water proof and has SD card capabilities The S7 Edge is great to look at and even better to use The screen is crystal clear with excellent detail while the battery life is tremendous I am completely impressed with this phone I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 so it was a huge change The features are amazing especially on the camera Speed is not an issue everything runs fast I would make the same choice again if I needed to I plan on buying another phone for my son This phone is incredible I have loved every minute of owning it so far The camera is remarkable and the quality of 4GLTE is amazing I was able to pick up a signal where previously it was impossible Was skeptical of purchasing this phone at due to my dislike of the design of the S6 but after consulting with a Samsung expert and playing with a demo of the phone I felt like this was the right decision Ive had the phone for about 3 weeks now and have been super happy with my purchase And have recommended this phone several times already Pros

Cons
A bit pricey 4 generation of Samsung Galaxy up grade in my contract with at  t and keep going This device has just set the bar for all other smart phones With its lighting fast ram capabilities And gorgeous super amoled display It is lightweight and I can clearly see the difference between older flagships I love how it has THEE biggest mAh battery on it and still have it be so slim It has taken a little bit to get use to the layout of the S7 as I upgraded from an S4 One of the first things I noticed was the great sound quality Have had the phone for a couple of weeks and so far love everything about it battery life great features ease of use sound speed and the fact they brought back water proof and ability to add memory Great job Samsung best one yet This phone has a great screen with good color Quick response Just the right size with great features Been a Samsung fan ever since I got my first Note 3 This is my first Galaxy S and I absolutely love it Display quality is amazing looks really vivid and the screen is wider due to the fact that I have the edge I love seeing my notifications pop up on my edge along with having quick access to my favorite apps and contacts The pictures are so clear no need to wait for camera to focus Battery last me all day Samsung pay is AMAZING love how fast and convenient that is and secure as it only works with my fingerprint Slim sleek design with lustrous silver color I absolutely love my new Galaxy s7 Edge So many great features glad I decided to upgrade I started with a Samsung S3 upgraded to a S5 and now have the S7 Picked up the S7 four days after the release date From the start I was impressed with the unit The main reason for purchase was the storage capacity of 32 GB upgradable to 200 GB I had already prepped a 128 GB Micro SD card with my music 20 GB before purchase The intent is to use the phone with ear devices to listen to music on long motorcycle rides and trips With the camera features and storage I will not need to worry about space for photos The apps seem to be well chosen I added Microsoft Word Excel and Outlook apps as I prefer them over the installed apps I still use the email app for my google account By the way setup was the easiest of all three phones for email and contacts The sales rep for my carrier transferred the contents from my S5 to the S7 So easy My only very minor issue is I havent found the instructions for the include data transfer tools he used Overall I think this phone will last me for a few years unless of course the next one is even more awesome I would highly recommend this phone because from my experience from going to a S4 to a S7 there was a big difference And the curbed edges are great it fits in my had so good The down side is that there are only gold and black available to the USA Upgraded from a galaxy s5 to the s7 edge Love the phone Lots of cool features that make it great I use Samsung Health a lot while bike riding or running or just at work to track steps Works great The edge screen is also awesome for quickly pulling up commonly used things Anyone who has ever had a Samsung Galaxy phone and has had to use anything else for some reason knows their is no comparison The S7 just does it all and does it fast so if your just making calls playing games or doing video chat it never slows down Just love the features and how easy it is to use The screen is much clearer and the processor is much faster Does everything you need and more
Love the speed and camera I am in LOVE with this phone I love the design and all the features I have the Galaxy S7 Edge Love the slim design and how its easy to use This is a great phone I have had Samsung phone for my last 5 or six phones but this one by far is my favorite The camera is great The screen is amazing It weighs almost nothing Ive had it for a few weeks and have not had a single problem with anything on the phone The always on display is great if youre like me and check the time almost compulsively But by far my favorite thing is the theme system Ilove being able to change the on screen feellook of my background buttons and keyboard with having to use outside apps  I have had it for about two weeks So far everything works as advertised It is a big jump in features  function and style from my old S III Plus the battery life is outstanding Running smoothly and never overheats after constant use of games the ability to turn off notifications and disable the back buttons while using apps is a great feature The phone has blown my old s5 out of the water performance for my games is incredible  no lag at all and the camera makes my wife happy and that makes me happy i would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good upgrade the screen resolution is incredible if you are looking for a full package phone you cant go wrong I love this S7 bigger display great camera and SD card was a plus thank Samsung I didnt want to trade in my S4 but decided to go for it and I am glad that I did Great new additions like Samsung Pay the fact it is water resistant and the amazing camera make this my favorite phone ever Other than being a tad too big this phone has everything I could ask for Theyve even figured out waterproofing Im in for the long run This phone is amazing I really like the edge detail And its slim as well which is a plus The screen size and clarity is awesome A total must have First off I am coming from a Moto X Pure edition and the only reason I picked that one up last year was because of the SD card not being on the S6 

Ok so this phone meets all my wants It has a finger print reader so that it is easy to log in to the phone and my apps that have that capability It has water proofing so just in case I drop my phone while I am snowboarding I do not have to worry if I get it wet  I just have to worry about the glass It is not bigger than 55 inches  not a huge requirement but I have found out I am not a big fan of large phones 

Needs meet 

My first need was the ability to have an SD card I am a person that takes a lot of photos so I need a place to put those photos and an SD card is best so it is easier to transfer files to my computer I am also a huge book podcast and music listener so I need a lot of storage to be able to store all this on 

Second is battery life What can I say I can leave my house at 430am and by the time I go to bed I have about 20 or so That beats my Moto X and my other phones And I do not just let my phone sit on my desk I listen to music podcast and books I play games on it and have the screen on about 5 hours of the day This is means I always have a phone when I most need it

Third and biggest need is a great camera I love this camera It is super fast Takes great photos and videos so I can keep my memories and share them I love being able to just press the home button twice and open the camera By the way have I said this camera is super fast and takes great pictures



Overall Samsung has a winner on their hands I love the way this phone feels in my hand compared to the S6 and larger phones This phone meets all my wants as well as all my needs I am so glad I decided to buy this phone I highly recommend this phone if your wants or needs are anything like mine Also did I mention that the included Gear VR with my purchase is great as well awesome phone slick and sexy its fast and the latest andriod version love the curve and the side function always on time and date is convenient overall my iphone friend is getting a s7 curve The functionality of the split window key was changed and I found no choices allowing changed use of that key or a replacement option There were times when the edge activating ability was useful but many times it selected unwanted advances and triggered texting in the pocket I only had the phone a short while so more acclimation would allow my slow learning pace to catch up the camera was a great improvement and having the option to move the shutter button to the edge would be beautiful I only saw a protective case after I returned the phone having that instead of some of the other gifts when I bought it might have changed my mind about returning it I am still considering getting the phone but more options of specific requirements would be needed Love that it doesnt waste my battery Very durable and compact I love my new phone I wish the battery was a bit stronger I do need to charge it more frequently Camera is great which I use constantly Phone would go dark too quickly and wasnt familiar enough with it so I changed from text password to fingerprint Finger small and device was not picking up fingerprint and eventually device locked up and had to be sent by to Samsung to reset Bummer Some products are ok some are good and some are great but when it comes to the Galaxy S7 Its SUPERB Not just because of its sleek look but the technology built into the phone is beyond what the competition has to offer Go check it out You wont be disappointed It truly is the best the industry has to offer Straight forward and easy to use at any age Just love it best phone in the market love the features also owned the S6 edge plus S7 edge and TV un55ju6500 Another great product from Samsung Keep up the great work I wish the phone was not made out of glass I love my phone other than than I also wish it came with a memory card I love my new phone I love the display It takes great pictures Easy to use 

Speakers could be better but other than that its a great phone This is a phone with many amazing features The camera takes wonderful pictures and the screen is easy on the eye with wonderful color rendition I really like the edge styling and I enjoy using the edge screens The speed of doing tasks and connecting is really quick I am really enjoying this phone I can honestly say that this is my favorite phone yet It has amazing graphics battery life and more Throughout the day I use it constantly playing games and such on my free time When I come home from school I have around 5060 battery life which is insanely awesome The galaxy s7 is just a great phone I am so glad Samsung listened to the community when making this phone because Samsung really nailed it with this new phone Only have had this phone for about two weeks but everything about it is fantastic the look the feel the design plus its waterproof whats not to love 100 better then the s6 love my new S7 I just got this phone and I like it a lot However the one thing Im really missing is the IR blaster  not vital but would have been nice  that being said this phone is fly  Feels awesomeon your hand  super sleek  Beautiful screen  Speakers ate in a better r spot this time  I went form the s5 to this model The one in between had terrible features  Im glad Samsung brought back the SD card slot While reviewing other phones on the market before I even considering buying this phone they seemed lacking and disappointing in there features and usability 

Being a iPhone user since 2009 and being happy with my decision until I realized there where phones out there that where not as restrictive and gave more options for you to freely use your smart phone as a smart phone was intended to used Rather then being told what you can use and what you can not In return for being restricted in the functionality or simplicity in or feel of the user experience

Switching over to the Samsung Galaxy S7 has been quite the game changer Siri is no longer in reach by a hold of a button Notifications work differently in the fact you have to manually customize what you want to see or not on he notification screen and the apps are usually updated automatically while on WiFi by default On the upside talking to Google or S Talk and asking to turn on your flashlight was a much noticed welcome among the motion gesture camera water resistance of the AMOLED glass surrounding body improved camera focus and low light picture ability Enabled radio was a surprise and getting used to the wireless fast charging was exciting no more damaged cords from accidentally pulling on the phone attached to the cord

Moving to the fingerprint reader It works smoothly and is easily configurable Samsung pay was a treat Not being used to paying for items at stores with my phone and its NFC Using the camera you will notice you can download new functionality such as wide selfie for taking pictures of the group your with without a selfie stick Live broadcast for when you want to show something in action in real time events or even virtual shot where you can show a object in a 360 degree radius You can use it as a regular DLSR Take sports pictures of fast moving objects and many other functionality I moved to the Edge from the Note line and love the look and feel of the Edge screen Samsung pay is great on the device i wish more retailers would open up NFC and more banks would add their card I went from am s4 zoom to this and I absolutely love it Amazing camera and features Runs amazingly Charges super fast No complaints at all Very nice phone Worlds of difference between my s5 and the s7 edge Took a while to find its hidden features and tricksbut well worth the effort Upgraded from the S5 it was fast and easy to transfer all my data
the Camera take very nice pictures and video Battery life is not that bad I would say better than most smart phones This phone is awesome It performs quickly and flawlessly I love the speed and battery life Lots of great features like deactivating bloat ware that have been much needed I love this device everything from the sleek design down to the well though out software Really like this phone Please add back Car Mode option had this on my Galaxy S5 I must confirm that i was really anxious about getting my Galaxy S7 Edge 

To me the phone is just a fantastic elegant classy piece of incredibly fast and easily assimilated technology

The resolution of OLED brings everything alive in ways that is hard to describe 

Navigating is really easy powerful and Uber Fast

Such fantastic quality I like everything about this phone and how it operates Still learning some new things every day Keep up the good work Samsung I recommend this phone over iPhone Features are exelent This is the 4th Samsung phone I have owned and it is quickly becoming one of my favorites The phone is beautiful especially the display Im so glad Samsung brought back SD card support because that is one of the main reasons I skipped on the S6 Unfortunately I have had the SD card unmount and remount itself numerous times in the short time I have used the phone This is especially annoying when it happens while you are taking pictures Hopefully it is just a software issue but it seems likely to be a hardware issue with the combo tray andor SD card reader With the SD card support of 128gb of storage I dont have to worry about running out of room with music and pictures I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 exactly two weeks ago today and I must say this phone is a pure joy to behold

It started with the unboxing The simple yet elegant packaging had a heft to it that told me there was something solid inside Boy was I right While not heavy by any means this phone has a very substantial feel in the hand With its gently rounded edges holding the S7 feels very natural and comfortable 

After topping off the battery extremely fast with the adaptive fast charging I began getting acquainted with this beautiful device Powering it on the first thing that grabbed my attention was the bright super clear display The familiar sounds of booting up were crystal clear too coming from the bottommounter speaker

With everything ready to go it was time to get set up Transferring my contacts etc from my old phone a Galaxy S4 to the S7 was surprisingly quick and easy using the transfer utility Overall getting all the apps I use and a few new ones installed and all of the options set up was fast and issuefree

It seems that every day Im learning something new about what this amazing device can do Samsung really knocked it out of the park with this one This phone replaces a note 3 for me Great battery life edge screen is fun I am loving my Galaxy S7 I am thrilled that it is water resistant like the S5 and has an expandable SD card slot Those features are why I didnt go for an S6 Also it was improved so now there is no power charger cover which broke off Very nice size and shape Need to by a case for it though its very slick Tried it for a week but no matter where we are home work car store calls get dropped or the person on the other end cant hear us Tried swapping out SIM cards software updates etc but nothing worked Been using Verizon for many many years and never had this problem with any of our phones The s7 is my first samsung phone I love the milk music app I use it almost daily But the battery life is not very good My battery drains really fast I have all the power save settings on and set and the battery still drains I upgraded from my S5 because my battery wasnt lastiing past noon The battery in new phone is no better I also dont like that you cant see the voice text before sending I love galaxy phones they get better and better I dont think I would get any other phone This is my first Samsung phone Ive had a Note8 tablet for years and the Galaxy tab that replaced the Nook Still trying to learn how the phone works The phone has a few issues that I hope will be fixed in an update iethe mute and vibrate button in the notification panel do not silence the phone The only way to silence the ringer is with the volume rockerpoor design if this is the only way to do this
Overall I am enjoying my experience with the phone I got my galaxy 7 when it came out so I have had it a few weeks now I use it for work as a driver for lyft Its been super dependable so far The upgradable memory is great too I didnt think I would like the s7 edge but I do I am a note lover for the last 4 generations But all the features are great As a long time user of Samsung Galaxy phones starting with the Nexus and most recently the S4 waiting for the Galaxy S7 to come out was long awaited
The speed and smoothness of the S7 was worth waiting for all around Id say the one feature that I loved on my S4 that isnt on the S7 was the air view feature which I loved
I did experience a problem within a week of getting the phone whereas the carriage that held the sim card and the micro SD card was not making contact at times internally and id get a message that it was ejecting and dismounting my micro SD card and then it would fix itself and a message would come up showing micro SD inserted as when you first start the phone I troubleshooted the device by replacing the sd card and even a factory reboot but the problem remained
I contacted warranty support and they quickly replaced it within a day As of now Im hoping this issue doesnt happen again but other than that I think Samsung has produced a phenomenal product Out of all the Samsung phones that I have owned this is definitely the best one keep up the good work Samsung Before this I was using the galaxy s4 which was working great for me as soon as I heard that the new phones would bring back the external memory I was sold This phone is amazing on Verizon and by far the fastest phone I have ever ever owned streaming music and movies has been great to the point that my S7 is now my go to for any streaming I do Due to my unlimited data we had to pay the full price for the S7 but I honestly think it was worth it I havent received my S2 smart watch yet but based on this phone I cant imagine ever using anything else but Samsung from now on I love this phone and all the features The fingerprint reader is so much easier than the S5 was My only problem is with the SD card taking so long to come up with my apps after a shut down Love the coloring and the feel of phone Way to go Samsung you have hit this one out of the park Great camera flawless display THE WORSE craftsmanship Screen stopped working after 3 weeks Does everything it states and more Small sleek design with a fast processor and longer lasting battery There are only 2 things I can complain about with this phone You cant take the back off and change the battery Also the ditched the IR blaster which for me was a crucial component If they got rid of these 2 features for waterproofing then its worth it This phone is an amazing upgrade from my s5 From the camera to the screen to the battery life This is the best phone out has some of the best features This is without a doubt the best phone Ive ever purchased The display is so crisp and detailed The camera takes amazing pictures the best Ive seen on a phone ever The performance is amazing All my apps open and run seamlessly The cherry on top Samsung Pay It has become my default form of payment wherever I go Great so far was able to set up adoptable storage following a document online Overall the phone has been fantastic and I am glad I decided to upgrade from my old phone The Edge adds a sexy look and feel to the phone that is not found on any other brand out there I still havent found a great use for the Edge itself although I like the Clock display on the edge while I am laying in bed The camera is spectacular and I am thoroughly impressed with how great the pictures and videos turn out even when zoomed in The phone comes at a great price competitive with other similar phones on the market although Samsung seemed to knock it out of the park with the S7 Edge The battery life is great Awesome pictures Thought it might be to big but after using it I find I like the bigger screen I upgraded from an S4 so this one is a huge change Its fast good security features pretty cool sound control that lets you personalize the treblebassetc while using headphones to enhance your personal sound quality The camera is pretty awesome Its fast and takes great pictures day or night I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 I have been a Samsung guy and was very happy with my old phone But the Galaxy S7 not only out performs tremendously my old phone it also out performs all of my coworkers phones by other manufactures The clarity of phone calls is phenomenal the quality of pictures are astonishing and the battery last forever I have been telling everybody to get one now I love everything about Samsung The picture quality the water resistant the screen display This phone is packed full of useful features Although I wasnt sure Id like the edge screen at first I chose this phone because of the screen size compared to the regular S7 I came from another brand and operating system but was ready to try something different The edge S7 has so many features I liked including waterproof expandable storage with SD card Samsung pay for magnetic readers and the weight The screen size is the same as my previous phone but in a much lighter package Absolutely love this phone i absolutely love the samsung s7 edge phones i got 2 of them and i tell you what its the best choice i ever made i love them i love the edge features and just love how fast they are the sound on them is so totally awesome too  

I highly recommend these phones to anyone  they are so awesome i have more people wanting to see my phone and complimenting me on my phones

These are like a dream cell phone I love everything about the edge except the size of the phone I am used to the Note 5 so this was a shocker to see the size difference Other than that all is GREAT I really love the camera features The look is much more flashy looking than the 5 I had a hard time choosing between the the s7 and the note but the comparison is only that the s7 is a smaller version But in all I absolutely love my galaxy s7 So far Im happy with this product in the beginning I had a few words because it wanted to go to sleep and not wake up but since then Ive had no other issues in the performance has been great Love the new S7 Battery life is great Only problem is that the WIFI doesnt work when BlueTooth is on Kind of a pain Ive owned many different phones and Samsung has did an amazing job with this phone The screen is super clear processing is fast and doesnt kill the battery I have convinced all my friends and family to make the switch to this phone I recently switched to an S7 from a iphon 6 I have been an iphone owner for the last 6 years but wanted to look into other options This was a great fit for me Fantastic pictures speed youd expect perfect screen size Samsung Pay is great hope it works with all of my Credit Cards shortly Demonstrated it use to members at my private club using old swipe readers and they could not believe how easy it was anc worked without having to swipe a care
Camera also outstanding Took a picture of our dog and cropped it by quite a lot and picture was still very sharp and did not show any blur from dogs movement
Rest of phone works just as good as my old S5 Having owned the original Droid Droid Razr Galaxy S5 iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 I consider myself having a decent idea for what the market has to offer and how these products evolve The Galaxy S7 is simply incredible

From a functional stand point S7 isnt that different from S5 so the transition was completely smooth However the build quality and the incremental improvements to the device makes it a work of art that Im really proud to carry in my pocket I bought this phone a week ago and have enjoyed it the whole time I have enjoyed the S5 S6 and S7 now The battery will last all day with Web surfing phone calls and gaming Charges quickly as well After the day at work I have a 35 minute drive Charging it on the way home puts it at 100 by the end of the drive while still leaving the phone on New features on this phone from the S6 that I am enjoying are video chat with my girlfriend who also has an S7 The pictures are just magnificent Even the pics from the front camera are crystal clear Just all around happy with the phone I bought this phone 3 weeks ago and so far I have no complaints The battery life is great I charge it at night and use it often during the day By 1100 I still have 43 battery and plug it back in for the next day Love it period
The only advice is  if you have problems with your palm touching the edge screenuse a casethe extra lip from the case will provide a buffer to you palm
Also its not easy to find a screen protector that works well on an edge screen that is also case friendly
I love that I can have a 55 screen on a phone not much taller than my Galaxy S4 and S5 I love how my S7 is smaller than my S5 It fits much better in my pocket and it does not weigh my pants down It works great Its super fast and the camera is just outrageous I can type a lot better on my S7 then I could on my S5 for some reason I also love the fact that when I drop my phone accidentally I know my phone is fine I have not had a cracked screen since I switched to the Galaxys Yall are holding up yalls name strong No complaints here Overall Samsung you did an awesome job I love the overall features and how it pares with my Gear 2s The only thing is the phone heats up a lot and the battery life could be longer Otherwise I am enjoying my phone and watch Love the Edge A huge step up in speed an AMAZING camera reasonable form factor FAST and it just works I typically customize my Android devices to the max but was pleasantly shocked to find the current version of Touch Wiz to be comparable to the paid app I typically use Way less bloatware than past phone and with expandable memory etc is hard to beat I love Samsung Galaxy phones Id never own anything different This Galaxy 7S Edge is amazing Could not be happier with the s7 it does everything better and faster and easier
Best out there I love this phone and all the features I have always been a big fan of samsung phones and products Love the edge screen My Samsung has met my current needs I truly like the fact that it has the sd card slot for the phone Ive used other phones that didnt and have lost all my pictures on that phone Im outside a lot and really like the water proof and scratch resistant that it offers Honestly I cant say one bad thing about this phone I went from the S4 to S7 and what a difference This phone is lightening fast and has unbelievable battery life The S7 is ahead of all other phones on the market right now I highly recommend the S7 believe me you will not be disappointed I love everything about it I love this phone It has the features I need to do what I need and it is clean without all of the clutter I dont like how the website thinks it is a gold one and it doesnt allow me to update the registration but it is ok I love the s7edge is good on performance and reliability I love this version on the Samsung so version just getting to learn the new features of it I bought this phone about a month ago and it continues to disconnect from wifi even though I havent left the location Overnight it will disconnect I hear its an upgrade issue and I have had several updates happen but it hasnt fixed that issue yet Im hopeful though because I do really like the phone Bought this phone about 10 days ago Nice phone with some good features and is easy to use The fingerprint feature worked for the 1st few days now it doesnt work at all I dont believe my finger print has changed Wiping the button clean does not help Also the battery life is not as advertised it is down to less than 75 in just about a 3 hour period of standby I love that Im able to take pictures in complete darkness and still able to have a clear picture I love it Ive used Galaxy phones and tablets for years now This is the best product Ive had the pleasure of owning Way to go Samsung Pictures are outstanding Love the expandable memory with SD card So glad to have the S7 I think my favorite feature is the expandable storage I take lots of pictures so I need lots of storage I give this phone  5 stars because of its features The Camera has such definition that you feel like you are right in the scene I took a video of my new grandson and it looked like someone was right next to me doing the video It is very life like pictures The main reason I got the phone was for the camera I like the low light motion and the all options that camera has I upgraded from the S5 to the S7 edge and couldnt be happier This thing is not only slim and sleek but fast and the battery life is 1000 better than the S5 I am loving it I plan to use it with my Gear VR Goggle when it ships This is by far the best Galaxy yet It is much faster and easier to use than previous versions of the Galaxy class phones I have used Samsung phones for about 15 years and I am continually impressed at the level of quality and use of technology Only thing I would change is dropping the need for the Samsung apps that repeat what Google Android already do It gets a bit redundant Keep up the great work I liked my Samsung S5 but it was short on memory My S7 Edge is not only better on memory but other improvements are very much to like The camera is better especially in low light as well as faster The screen size is just enough larger I no longer have to contend with that rubber plug on the charger hole and it is still water proof Now that I have the charger pad all I have to do is lay it on the pad and dont have to mess with the cord The speaker is also much better Milk music has a lot of different tunes I dont get on Pandora I have had the s7 edge for two weeks and love it I need a multimedia platform for work and the s7 works seamlessly Having multi email inboxes attached to the same device is perfect Highly recommended to enable better communication and increase productivity I recently stepped up to the Galaxy S7 EdgeI am very pleased with the overall quality performance feel  look to the phone
I thought my Galaxy S5 was the where all to end all when I first purchased but Samsung has continued to step up its game
The only reason I did not give the phone 5 stars across the board  because I want Samsung to continue to strive for an even better  more excellent phone Cant wait to see what will be next I had the Galaxy 5 before so switching to the new Galaxy S7 was simply an upgrade for me It is SUCH an improvement over my old phone which I liked a lot The camera is stunning the phone is quick and Ive been using it for about two weeks now and have never had to recharge the battery before the end of the day unlike all the phones I had previously Beautiful and easy to use phone Love the features and the size Camera on phone is great goo pictures and reaction time Still working getting used to the formatting from coming from a Iphone which I did not like but do enjoy the screen sharing with smart TVs I have been very pleased with it The battery lasts good and charges so quickly Easiest transition to a new phone ever I love my new phone I love the phone 
My problem is the random restarts that had happened since getting the phone 
Also some programs are running slower than the s5 that I use to have 
Also settings are set up differently so it is taking time to get use to it 
I like the features and Im loving the external storage being brought back 
I love the speaker being on the bottom instead of on the back 
Not thrilled that the headphone jack is on the bottom 
Love love love love the camera This is my first personal Android phone and I am still getting used to it The phone is very fast and responsive Sound quality is great on calls and playing videos online The camera is excellent and I look forward to using it more since I like to take pictures Installing apps from the Google Play Store is easy Samsung did an excellent job in making this phone a joy to use Best phone Ive had Love how it works and is an exceptionally great phone I love that phone it does everything that I need it to do for me Well lets see I have been seeing connection issues a lot since I got my phone but it is a quick fix all I need to do is clear the open apps and it goes back to normal Besides that the phone is actually quite amazing All features are perfectlying placed
Beautiful screen best camera and fast response
Love it The picture quality is amazing while the sound from this device is ever better than the previous Galaxies LOVE this phone I love my new phone It is very easy to use everything is explained in the area that you are using The display is amazing its crisp and bright The pictures I take are beautiful Im enjoying this phones look and functions and style Originally purchased an ATT US version of the Galaxy S7 Edge and although I loved the phone I had to return it due to major problems encountered at the point of sale and with activation over my ATT account Ended up purchasing an unlocked S7 Edge instead While there is nothing at all to dislike about this phone  from the design the weight the feel the speed the functionality  the one feature that is unavailable on the unlocked phone is Samsung Pay Unfortunately Samsung Pay is truly one of the killer apps for this device I had a chance to use Samsung Pay during the few days I had my original S7 Edge and was pleased with the function although it only allowed me to register one of my cards  the rest of them are currently unsupported Being able to use a mobile wallet virtually anywhere  even when NFC taptopay options are unavailable  was pretty fun and got lots of positive reaction Will hope and pray that this functionality comes soon to my current S7 Edge but then at the same time until they add more banks and cards the app would not have much edge over Android Pay in daytoday usage since Android Pay a supports many more cards and b isnt carrier dependent

Overall HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Galaxy S7 Edge I got this phone the day it came out I am a Samsung fan first off the camera is amazing My son recwntly got his temps and he was driving down the road and I sneezes a pic of him The houses in the background are crystal clear going 40mph Also the slow motion video has sound Function and ease of use are like other galaxy phones Only knock I have is that I was hoping the bartery would last longer It is good but not great The features on the S7 is more fancy than my S5 of course However the phone will not stay connected to the Bluetooth in my car my WiFi continues to disconnect and the battery doesnt last long and thats with everything disabled I was excited about having something new but Im seeing that new is not always better Samsung please get it together Phone is a major upgrade over my S5 The camera is amazing especially at low light and its water proofenough said I have had S7 Edge for a few weeks now so far I am loving the phone The phone feels great in the hand and fits well in my pocket I love the EDGE functions using my thumb only to access what I use the most The battery charges quickly and has lasted the entire day with normal usage 

The transfer of data from my old phoneS4 to the S7 Edge was pretty smooth using the USB connection and adapter to link both phones 

The quick connect function allows me to connect the phone to my car and smartTV quickly The bluetooth works great in the car for both phone calls and listening to music stored on my micro memory card Once you setup the bluetooth it connects automatically to the vehicle

The GEAR VR is an awesome addition for the phone It enhances the S7 Edge in ways you would not believe The experience is something to see

Great Device This phone rocks Performancewise this phone is the fastest one I have ever had Apps load VERY fast screen resolution is unmatched and sound quality in a call and media is amazing The design rivals any phone on the market with a sleek metal back and edges that looks like a tuned sports car Samsung never disappoints which is why I only buy from that brand I love my new S7 I have had a S3 S5 and now a S7 can they get any better I dont know how but Samsung keeps impressing me I also have a gear 2 watch 2 Bluray players 2 tvs and a sound bar all made by Samsung I am a die hard Samsung buyer Love the new camera features The 360 photo really lets u capture the entire moment around you so you never miss anything I owned an S5 for 2 years and loved it The nicest part about staying with another galaxy is that its a Galaxy I just upgraded from the S4 to the S7 I like the fingerprint security feature The camera is so fast and the pictures are crystal clear Low light pictures look great The always on feature is great as I wake up in the middle of the night and can see the time without messing around The reason I waited to upgrade is having an external memory card to keep all my music and photos on I am glad I upgraded to this new phone If you are look for the best phone on the market you found it in the Samsung S7 I really like the S7 It has great features and I love the themes you can choose for the phone I have not found anything that I do not like about the phone I am still learning about all the features and so far I love them all THIS PHONE HAS BEEN AMAZING SINCE DAY ONE
SMOOTH AND POWERFUL THE CAMERA IS GREAT AND PICTURE QUALITY IS BRIGHT AND CLEAR
WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND Great Features the connectivity to the watch is outstanding for us that are on the go Frequently leave my phone in the truck or at home and count on the watch Only flaw I see with the design I dont understand why Samsung did not use Gorilla glass on this device Huge error in my opinion Speakers work great 100 times better than my Galaxy S4 Cost is a little high but I expect that to drop as time goes on of course that doesnt help me I do recommend to my friends and family If you can afford it you wont be disappointed go ahead and get it I am completely in love with this phone as a whole with one exception I think a way to protect the screen has to be developed other than the possibility of thin plastic that will prevent scratches but not shattering Not to say gorilla glass is not very tough I just still worry Otherwise this phone is amazing fast smart great features battery lasts forevercomparatively to the s5 All in all the only thing i would add is the easily replaceable battery like the 5 that was one of my selling points but Ive been so sold on Samsung i just couldnt say no to this beautiful piece of phone I had an iPhone 6 and I was bored with it so I went to the s7 so that I could personalize more and have fun with my phone Well I have 12 mgb of storage available on this phone and just this morning it wouldnt open my messages just be a black screen Had to turn it off and back on and it lags sometimes Win some lose some After two weeks with this phone I am finding it more comfortable to use as my business phone Decided to go with this phone as opposed to iPhone due to the opportunity to expand storage via SD card Battery life is ok while not as good as my personal iPhone 6 Ill need to be sure to have charging available everywhere The camera is fantastic Everything about this phone is great Ive had all the galaxy phones and this edge by far is the best I went from the S5 to the S7 so happy with the slim design and the amazing battery life this phone has The camera takes awesome pictures even in low light conditions So glad they fixed the software glitch that occurred during the first week but since the update I have had no issues I cant imagine using any other phone than the Samsung Galaxy family the quality of these phones are phenomenal and I love that they are waterproof After having the device lass then 24 hours the display developed a solid green line just right of the center of the face of the phone ATT notified but unit is out of stock Very unhappy with the Love the camera and the display of the screen Phone is very fast This phone although faster than the phone that it replaced has about the same features as the previous phone The construction of the phone is a disappointment as well in my opinion Unfortunately it was dropped from a distance of no more than 15 inches fell on its backand the glass shattered I though this was supposed to have had some kind of Gorilla Glass Purchased two galaxy 7 phones and one went bad two weeks later
Two buttons quit working had to have replaced Had used this galaxy 7 for less than two weeks when power button and volume down button would not workHad to have replaced  I love the every feature of the phone i am glad to own this device Great sleek phone So fast with new 4gb of ram The water resistance and the memory card being brought back and the camera taking unbelievable pictures this is the best phone out there Voice text is not showing the screen properly after reset and powering off and powering off But overall the phone is good the other box could have been better for it though I keep learning about the Samsung Galaxy 7 everyday I love this so much more than the 6 I believe that they put those features back into the 7 that they didnt put in the 6 The added memory longer battery life and the easy access and added features Although I still have not discovered the entire phones features I love this phone Everyday I learn something new Great job Samsung I used to sell phones for a living and I know about all the features of every phone This phone is absolutely incredible The battery lasts forever it is lightning fast and the VR headset is out of this world Highly recommended phone and well worth the money I used to be just an iPhone person but since I got this phone I knew that android was right for me This phone has one of the best cameras I have ever seen and I just love how I can excellent drop it in a puddle and Ill be completely fine Its display and science are just perfect for my hand I love all the features it comes with including but not limited to fast charging wireless charging and a very universal charging port even though it may slow the conversion to USBC Even though some people dont like it I like the skin Samsung puts on the phone known as TouchWiz UI Unlike the galaxy S6 and I like how the S7s edges are much more useful I also like How they increased the battery capacity over S6 Edge 5 STARS TO SAMSUNG Real cool phone coolest phone Ive ever had recommend it by far than any iPhone Phone is incredibly awesome The device display is one of a kind Samsung definitely meets my expectations Phone is awesome Smooth and fluid
 Great everything The S7 is fast and very easy to get the hang of using it and unlocking all the features of the phone and how far u can go with it Battery lasts longer but could use some work on making last longer while its being used constantly like maybe incorporate a solar panel for duel power I loved the curved screen and side notification bar Like how the side of the screen lights up when screen is faced down and a call comes in Great phone with expandable memory which is good for storing all the great pictures and videos from its great camera Ive had iPhones for the last 5 years I NEVER thought Id like anything else Even the older galaxys I wasnt a fan of I have another phone line and it needed a phone on it so I decided to try this one And I LOVE it So much so that Ive decided to switch the galaxy s7 to my main line and use my iPhone 6s Plus on my other The battery definitely doesnt last near as long as advertised but it does charge SUPER fast I let both my iPhone and the Galaxy get to the same battery percentage hooked them both up and the Galaxy charged almost twice as fast The pictures are incredible crisp and clear even when my 2 year old is moving around dancing being silly it captures that moment without it being blurry And I LOVE that you can add more storage just with an SD card I take tons and tons of picturesI have almost 9000 on my iPhone so its a big deal for me And even though the screen is substantially smaller than my iPhone its still amazing I also love the keyboard when you click on symbols even when you press space it doesnt go back to letters which is something Ive always hated with the iPhone
I dont think Ill switch my main line back to the iPhone Ive had the Galaxy S7 Edge in Platinum Gold now for 3 12 weeks now so the honeymoon phase is over for the most part and I can honestly say that this is the happiest Ive ever been with a phone Ive never had a smartphone battery last me as long as this one has the display is amazing and the phone itself is extremely responsive  even after loading it up with dozens of apps While Ive never really taken many pictures with other phones in the past Ive found myself using the camera on the S7 Edge a lot Focusing is nigh instantaneous and the image quality is superb Its not all sunshine and rainbows though I accidentally activate the sides of the screen when picking it up much more often than on other phones and the curved display can sometimes be distracting while watching videos or playing games Despite those quibbles I am extremely pleased with this phone and would recommend it to anyone who values battery life picture quality or beautiful design I love my phone especially the themes Great product If you want a fast and reliable phone look no more  this is the one you want Awesome phone best Ive owned does all I want it to The galaxy s7 edge exceeded my expectations its the fastest smartphone Ive seen Excellent phone Seems very durable Water resistance is a great bonus Has quick responses So far love the Galaxy 7 Edge Really love the long battery life At work my batteries always drain fast even not being used not the g7 Only goes down 1020 Even had my Sirius app on for 3 hrs and battery barely drained The build of this phone is beautiful and well designed I love the screen quality its crisp and vivid Images just pop out of the screen The performance of the phone is great apps load instantly with no hesitation The cameras front and back are great the pictures you can take with this phone are better than those Ive taken from an iPhone 6 Its my goto device for all pictures The coolest part of this phone is the Samsung Pay feature which Ive been using all the time since I got the phone Its extremely convenient and fast to access The call quality is clear and the mic picks up sound really well even in speakerphone mode This phone is great But I still like iPhone better do to the OS I like the android OS but I wish it could be as smooth as even an iPhone 4 The android OS isnt all there Maybe for an android user this lag in the OS isnt a big deal but for iPhone people wanting to switch over like me its a let down Its not a deal breaker but you just wish the phone could be as fast and smooth as an iPhone Other than that what isnt there to love Its a great phone
But until they can be on the same level
as an iPhone on the smoothness an speed its a let down Im still hoping for an update that could make me eat my words  
And I would love to try out a tablet New features  always on display works awesome would like it to display emails also though The battery is an improvement But still unable to remove it bummer The screen is brighter and easier to see in sunlight I preordered the S7 And I have never been happier since I got it overall great phone wish they would have left some features settings that the G4 and 5 had calibration gone need to tap buttons slightly harder keyboard features seem less Biggest thing is they took the scroll thru screens away You have to back track to the home screen instead of scrolling back around to it That is this biggest change I dont like CAMERA IS AWESOME Fast shutter brilliantly clear sharp pictures Would recommend I have had galaxy phones in the past but was not too pleased with them as they didnt perform that well and had too much bloat ware on them The s7 edge though seems to have fixed all the issues I had with the previous versions I have been very happy with the phone so far and performance has been great Charges fast love the fingerprint scanner unlocking and the health monitor is pretty neat too Of course I am hesitant to test the water resistant feature but glad its there The camera has beenough a great improvement as well and takes great photos This is a step up from the note4 and I love it 
I would advise all family member to covert Having only had this phone for a shorttime the pros are very apparent lightweight thintho a bit larger than my last phone very responsive to touch easy to operateeven for a nontechy like me the transfer between phones was fairly straightforward tho not as easy as I had hoped 
I like the phone very much in the shorttime I have had it works really well has on screen notifications for calls texts emailsI love the ability to block calls from the call screen Had the phone for a couple of weeks now Works great clear sound sharp display I use it for a hot spot and it works great This phone has the best of everything except the no hdmi plug I have owned my S7 edge for 2 weeks now and despite some bugs with WiFi and the SD Card which I am hoping they will send updates to fix it has been amazing The speed and functionality of the phone is phenomenal The feel of the quality design is a huge step up from the old plastic galaxies Ive owned in the past I LOVE the battery life I used to have to plug my phone in all day whether at work in my car and this lasts without charging The camera is the best I have ever used next to a DSLR It takes pictures quick and with fabulous resolution It has so many neat little features as well such as the always on screen which doesnt effect battery life at all Samsung please fix the bugs and I will be completely ecstatic about this device Went from an S3 to the S7 excellent choice for me Everything exceeded my expectations by far with my new S7 The camera is awesome screen resolution is amazing the user interface is more friendly I am really happy that I got this cellphone for me and another one for my wife Love Samsung products The call quality is great and taking photos is awesome because I love taking photos every single day The Galaxy S7 Edge is an amazing device Out of all the phones Ive had this one is not only the best performing and longest lasting but by far the best looking This device sports some amazing curved edges which helps the you grip the phone which by the way is quite slippery Also the features of the S7 Edge are great Bringing back microsd card expandability was a superb choice and the IP 68 rating defiantly helps with the durability of it Over all I would consider the phone the best on the market Maybe thats even an understatement This phone far beats out any other phone on the market in my opinion But like all things There is one major flaw THE size This phone has a huge display for the size of the device But still for someone with small hands upper left hand icons are hard to reach I recall the first time when I purchased my first smartphone and it was a Samsung phone with windows mobile OS then the mobile market was in early stages since the old times ive had different phones from an array of manufacturers but nothing like Samsung I recently upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the S6 I was glad the company listened to customers and brought back the most desired features such as water resistance and sd card but the top change that caught my attention was the camera upgrade this is best mobile camera by far of any device Take my word for it this is an iPhone killer and with android built in cant go wrong kudos to Samsung I have only had the S7 for a short time but so far it has lived up to its hype The screen is clear in all light levels The camera works great in all lights levels too The feel in your hand is comfortable and feels natural The features and intuitive interface just make the phone a great tool The battery saving features of the game folder is pretty nice too Unboxing this phone was not a disappointment It has weight and depth to it a solidity that makes it feel as sturdy as it looks It has great responsiveness and lots of processing power

 The display is topnotch visible in high sunlight bright and clear The glass even without a protector is solid slick to the touch and very scratch resistant In body the phone has a good size to fit the hand with buttons in easy thumb reach Without a case my only criticism is that the Edge functions make it difficult to hold and use onehanded without  

Battery life is much better than my old M8 and overall this is a phone Id recommend to anyone who loves a good tech gadget Love the sleek sophisticated style of Galaxy s7 Holding it for the first time I noticed how smooth the back of the Galaxy s7 felt in my hands The processing speed is amazing no glitches and no lags The camera on the s7 is outstanding Pictures come out very clear Downloading time is super fast and there are so many appsThank you Samsung On 42516 this awesome phone was droppeda day before my protective case arrivedsigh It has since been replaced via insurance claim but other than the cosmetic damage this is by far the best phone Ive ever had Truth be known I was originally looking to purchase a Note5 but after hearing about this model about to be released by Samsung and the fact that I wanted a phone with memory expandable well past 64Gb this was the hands down choice 

One thingregarding a few of your old apps if youre upgrading from a prior Galaxy S line phoneyou might have to head to the Galaxy Apps store to retrieve them or get their updated equivalentlike the video app which in the new phone shares real estate with their music app and just wasnt the same old app I was use to The Edge function might seem to be missing when you first start using the phone but thats only due to an updated version that was ready for release about the same time the phone was Once downloaded and installed tweaking to your likingand you WILL like it Love the larger size compared to the S6 Very fast Awesome display Love the return of the SD card slot Camera is ridiculously good Do miss my IR blaster though I cycle outdoors for hours at a time and love that I no longer have to worry about a little down pour now and then because of the water proof feature Would love front facing high quality speakers in the future 

Love This Device I work in a phone store and i have never had a phone last all day on one charge I also love that it is waterproof so when i let my daughter have it i feel safe The processor is very fast able to handle multiple apps being open at one time it is also able to handle the watch apps The clarity of the screen and photos are best in class All around great phone great price Great product I love all the features in my phone battery is the best no complaints about This phone has some speed Design is amazing Just overall a great phone This is the best phone ever A perfect combination of size and features The edge screen is amazing and easy to use Awesomeness 
Dropped IPhone in water so needed replacement
Lucky Me
Virtual Reality Google search are insane I have had Samsung Galaxy phones since the original and this is by far the best yet Now yes the phones are supposed to get better every single year but this one is a huge improvement over the others The phone is lightning fast The battery life is great Samsung pay is awesome and even works on the cruddy card readers at Walmart This is an amazing phone with and amazing display I cant recommend it enough to anyone who loves high end android smartphones Had the phone 2 weeks now and it works great Battery lasts almost 2 days on a charge WiFi connects great and the speed of fingerprint recognition is amazing Going back to the micro SD slot was a fantastic response by Samsung to customer feedback The waterproof capability is a real comfort though I hope neverto need it Now if Samsung will adopt the shatterproof screen The camera is amazing Overall 5 stars Congrats Samsung Job well done I have had and researched many phones I loved the Droid 2 and since then have not been happy with anything even the IPhone I love this phone It is easy to set up and use The features are excellent The camera is out of this world It is fast and I am on ATT network in Arizona and it also works great I would recommend this phone to EVERYONE After having a Samsung Galaxy s3 for three years I was ready for a new phone The s7 was just coming out and after checking it out several times at the store I decided to get it I love it It is fast and and has a lot of features 
 The camera is great
 Big improvement The screen is amazingly vivid the colors are very warm and attractive The touch screen is a bit on the sensitive side but thats not always a bad thing The best feature of the screen is the edge Its simple yet unique in design and adds to its appeal much like the curves of a woman  The battery for me at least isnt the best compared to my previous Motorola nexus 6 which is another great phone but I havent fully explored my controllable options for maintaining background updates and running applications just yet keep that in mind Performance wise its fast at certain points but has slowed down and restarted on me a few times its probably my fault with the amount of apps I have installed its about 97 apps so if you have that many try to either cut back on the apps or manage their usage better An app called Clean Master will assist you with this Other than that games and everything else from multitasking windows to the other many unique features that Samsung phones have to offer performance is a 910 by my book which is a good thing The volume and lock screen buttons are perfectly placed to allow for better one handed operation the phone itself comes with a feature that benefits just that when turned on Something as simple as double tapping the home button for the camera is perfect for those quick moments my cats do something silly The camera focus is fast and accurate but suffers a little in low light from far as expected Still a great camera for most anything though Very easy to use user interface not pure stock Android but a luxury of features to boot All in all its a great option for a phone with many customizable benefits to fit your lifestyle Upgraded from the S5 The camera is so much better and faster I miss not having the ir blaster My phone was always my backup remote when my toddler would hide the actual TV remote This is my 2 Samsung phoneexcellent productsgreat online videos to help you learn the features of the phonevery easy to use and understandI am a senior of 68 years so I appreciate being able to view a videoshave had one chat conservation she did an excellent job on answering my questionlove my new phone Wasnt going to purchase another galaxy phone after the changes made to the s6 The s7 is just a little smaller than the s5 None of the camera problems i had with the s5 It has a solid feel but i did put a caselogic case on it because of the very slick back casing The caselogic case has a nice textured back and a lip around the screen helping me avoid hitting things with my palm Over all so far so great Would like to figure out how to turn down the screen sensitivity Love this phone it is quicktakes great photos and videos look awesome Great phone I switched from iPhone and it took a little to get used to new setup and operating system Could not be more happy with switch Once I got everything dialled in the way I wanted it the phone runs amazing and battery life is a beast compared to iPhone Had phone since release and I have never killed battery in a day without actively trying to Usualy have heavy use through day and still have 30 juice by time I go to bed Great features and it does not over heat like the phone i had in the past Just got this phone but im not impressed so far The only things I like are the camera and the fact its water resistant The battery does not last long at all and my phone wont takes forever to connect to anything even in WIFI Otherwise I wish I had my old phone back  This phone is amazing Features apps battery life and overall quality are great Absolutely love this phone I really like water proof and finger printing features Great phone takes good pictures The the way you can minimize some of the apps its so convenient so I can multitask and do two things at once Got the phone last month and like it This is my second galaxy This phone is built on the foundations of great work Ive really been enjoying my new s7 so far the battery life seems to be much longer than my s6 almost half a day more and the curve in the back of the phone case is nice to hold during a phone call Wonderful picture quality great camera waterresistant expandable memory thin with a crisp display Multifunction edge options makes my day seem more organized with just a slight swipe to access task people weather and my places Had an LG G2 that I loved until Lollipop rendered it useless even after several factory resets and no Marshmallow upgrade available Opted to upgrade to the S7 when I was sucked in by a sweet deal at Best Buy So far Im okay with the phone Call quality seems good love the size of the phone and the Samsung features like flashlight and Shealth tracking Bluetooth works well as does WiFi Camera is awesome Fingerprint recognition is hit and miss and so is the always on display which I only use during the night but often isnt on when I look at it first thing in the morning Battery life is okay at this point With average use it still has around 30 left at the end of the day I deeply hope the battery life doesnt start diminishing since theres no option to change it out Plus 1 to the LG G3 and subsequent LG phones for their removable batteries Also and this is kind of major I really do not like side volume and power buttons Always in the way during calls and camera use although the new protective cover I got does sort of remedy that But the cover makes it really difficult to depress those buttons Plus 1 to LG for their back buttons Plus 1 also to LG for their knock on feature I have 7 more days left of my 14 day free return period Still wondering if I might return this and get the LG G5 instead One more week to decide Side note there was a system update available to download when I bought the phone The phone came with Marshmallow installed and I must say I do love Marshmallow Other phones considered Droid Turbo 2 Samsung S6 LG G3 LG G5 Really like the galaxy S7 the battery life is good and with the original charging cable it charges very quick not so much on the charging pad I have it takes quite a bit longer with it I also have some trouble with the messaging somehow contacts I had already on the phone are gone Other than that its a great phone and I am happy with it Great product I switched from iOS to Android and I will not be switching back My friends are tired of hearing me talk about my new cell phone but I cant help myself I have 200 gigabytes of memory on my phone beat that I like the new sleek look and the camera is way better then the s5 This phone is by far the best phone I ever owned It has great charge capacity processor speed as well as quality Keep it coming Samsung NO IPHONE EVER I have to say I loved the Galaxy 5 but I started researching the g7 back in late December boy the more I read the more I was excited to get it It is the best phone out there I love the new features Quicker And sleek Fits perfect in my hands and I love that is has a memory card slot Thank you for a great phone OH yea could not wait to tease my friends because I got mine on Thursday Verizon has always been the best of phone companies out of all of them out there I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 and it was a very easy transaction and the phone is amazing Awesome core processor and the amazing camera quality are just of the few next generation phone qualities that has started with the s7 and is still to come Would say its the perfect buy From Samsung Payton the camera this phone can do it all Samsung has once again out did themselves with there s7 line All though not a huge difference from previous s6 line They did listen to consumers and brought back the SD card option That alone helped me decide to purchase the s7 I did not purchase the s6 because of the no SD expansion option The removable battery option is not that big of a deal for myself Hands down Samsung out did themselves My hat goes off to all the employees that spent hours at work and away from there families My family and myself will always be a Samsung household Cant wait to see what else you unfold Upgraded to the S7 because my Note 4 had broken I have had the phone for 3 weeks now and the performance has be very good The battery life is actually better than the battery on my wifes S6 and my former Note 3 I have not noticed any performance issues in anyway Definitely one of the best phones I have ever owned I have had cell phones since the beginning I am really happy to be back with Samsung after using Motorola The camera is amazing it took awesome pictures at a concert I went to and I love having the expandable memory I love it I tell all my android friends this has to be their next phone This product has amazing spectrum of array of perfect features lol This phone not only works great but it also looks good So far so good Easy to use and handle Perfect sizes Very impressed with my new Galaxy S7 Made a life time Samsung owner out of me i wish have some future from the galaxy 5 on this new phone Works pretty good Takes awesome photos Video games are vibrant Only 1issue since i got the phone but samsung took care of it immediately Im hapy with this paroduct Ive been a Galaxy Girl over 4 years and Im never disappointed this s7 has the power to multitask like no otheri can be listening to my musicwhile textingand checking email all at the same time with the split screenmy music is in the background runningand i can be checking emailand a text pops upno problem with the s7battery has the staying power to last all dayand i still listen to my music for at least 8 hours a dayi love the wireless charger i got as welljust plop it on while on the nightstandand it charges awayand very fast tooscreen is brillanttakes awesome pictureseven in extremely low light

this thing definitely makes you more productive

awesome addition to my belt Samsung S7 Edge Id the best phone Ive ever used I was debating about going back to the iPhone when my S5 was giving me problems But this phone blows both out of the water 
I love the speed of the phone as well as all the new features and I love Samsung Pay The phone itself is an amazing device and captures photos quick which I enjoy The water resistant is also a plus Through the years I have owned over a dozen different smart phones mostly from Samsung The s7 Edge is by far the best phone I have ever owned It used to be that I would have to root phones to get the features i wanted But with the combination of features on the Edge and the Marshmallow operating system i have everything I could want or need I love the Qi charging the micro sd slot the camera the fingerprint scanner and the Always On Display What more could I ask for Thank you Samsung Home run Everything about this phone is great Its nice and fast I love this phone Its slimmer and lighter then my s5 was but for some reason when people call it says its not in service when it clearly is Also since the surface is so smonth it is Slippery Samsung got it right where they came up short with the S6 Expandable memory water resistant and USB connectivity A little disappointed with the decision to ditch the infrared blaster but not a deal breaker for me I was a little more overall disappointed with the S6 and the S7 remedied much of my issues Lightning fast and a great product For the month that ive had the Galaxy s7 edge everything about it is great The design and the performance of the phone is like a dream I love the edge and the definition of the screen is beautiful The only problem that ive come across is that my phone will activate the split screen mode randomly

Another win for samsung HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS THUS FAR WORKS AS ADVERTISED I cannot get over just how great thing phone is I love all of its features I bought this phone to assure compatibility with my G2 smart watch Although it has only been just a couple of weeks I am glad I did The watch and phone are seamless in functioning together Both are extremely intuitive and the G2 is simply awesome It does everything flawlessly I am not a power user when it comes to games so I have not feedback on down loading various apps Both used for business and personal communications No complaints so far I like the new phone Specially the Samsung Pay Its great
But I am missing the feature of grouping of email on conversation  wish I could have that Performance wise great phone awesome feel to the body of the phone Love the layout of new software phone runs really smooth Only thing I would change is the battery life still suffient as is but lasting a little longer is always welcoming Very disappointed in battery life I have added sd card and the icon at top keeps popping back up camera takes good pictures big issue is you cant have WiFi and Bluetooth on at same timeI never had that problem with TurboSamsung needs to fix this problem wish I would not have got this phonenow im stuck with it I love the speed of the processor and the screen resolution is excellent Expandable memory waterresistant and is android based What more could you want Highly recommended A I work as a direct sales rep and having a good quality camera for photos and videos is a big deal for me The camera on the s7 edge works better than my professional camera and it is multifunctional This is the best phone I have ever owned I have had it since launch and I have run into absolutely no issues It performs way above any standard I may have set before I received it I have recommended it to numerous family and friends A satisfied customer here This is my favorite S series to date Started with an S2 I skipped the S6 because of the lack of SD card so when it came back in the S7 I decided to get it The size is much better than my S5 which I found to be just a hair too wide to hold comfortably The only thing I am really really missing is the IR blaster for the TV it was handy since I always know where my phone is Ive read that the EDGE version has it but I was to afraid I would crack its curved glass edges Great pictures very clear
Have been a bit disappointed in the battery life Lasts about 5 to 6 hours which was about what my S5 lasted The fast charge is definitely a bonus and works better than my previous fast charger About 20 minutes from 46 to 100
Was having disconnection issues with WiFi but since the last upgrade this seems to have improved
I moved my 64 G card over from my old phone so all pics and files came with Nice having the 32G in the phone My old phone only had 16 G an I was forever getting notices to delete info
Overall I like this phone and find it very easy to use I love Samsung phones but the truth is theres no glaring differences that Ive noticed between my s7 and my s5 Yeah theres small differences not an upgrade with the user interface an unnoticeable increase in processing speed and unless you get the s7 edge minimal design changes Maybe when I receive the vr gear Ill be able to justify upgrading to an s7 from an s6 or even an s5maybe The phone is really good still trying to get used to the edge phone The only problem with the phone is the price I payed for the Samsung s7 edge More then I payed for my laptop Finally a stylish waterproof phone I absolutely love this phone Battery life is amazing and it has all kinds of other great features Moved from Windows 10 to Android Like my Edge 7 phone features Was so looking forward to getting this phone I got it almost 2 weeks ago and have been having issues while being on WiFi Phone goes completely slow on WiFi and have had no access to my cloud Have already exchanged it for a new s7 edge and still have the same issue Have done both system updates and numerous trouble shooting on my second phone and now probably heading on a third phone Other then that it is a good phone Takes great pictures and screen quality is good battery life is good to Its an all around great phone however there are a few minor features that samsung has removed from their phones that makes this phone not perfect Its also almost nondistinguishable from my S5 I had a GS5 prior to this and I wish I didnt now have the GS7 because I hate it The GS7 is definitely easier on the eyes and its nice to be on Marshmallow So the phone looks great on the outside and on the inside The slightly curved periphery has made it difficult to get a glass screen protector to work well near the edges Really nice to have SD card capability and water proofing back in the series But the only and likely the biggest issue is the battery

Samsung did not bring back the removable battery so swapping out for a fresh battery whenever mine is dead is no longer an option Ive had the phone for about two weeks and Ive already noticed a drop off in battery life The fast charge also takes longer than the initial estimation for a full charge This is all in addition to the fact that the VR is an absolute battery hog

I dont care about the outside appearance which could be why a removable battery was still not reintroduced as most users put a case on the device anyway I hate having to plug it in to a charger I hate not using my phone to its full capability because I have to conserve battery I hate this phone Best phone I have ever owned recommend to anyone looking for a new phone I entered into the realm of smartphones with the Galaxy s7 Edgeand much fear and trepidation I have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of use for a new user If I had questions I would ask Samsung voice and would immediately be taken to answers I am not sure that I will find the Edge feature really usefulI chose the Edge because of the somewhat larger screena screen with brilliant resolution But as I explore the uses of those features I will probably discover some very convenient shortcuts The camera features are definitely a plus There is still much for me to learn but so far I am very happy with this phone I normally update my phone every 2 years my last phone was the s5 so when the s7 cane out with the SD card I knew I was going to stay with Samsung Its a very nice phone and very responsive Fits in the hands very nicely I had a Galaxy S5 then I got another phone Im so glad I came back to Samsung I love my Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung Im back to stay Before this phone I was not a huge Samsung fan I thought Touchwiz was way to bloated and they were behind Im happy to say I am very pleased with Samsungs UI and with the new hardware additions like SD card and waterproof I love that you can add a memory card increasing the memory It helps that its water resistant I upgraded from my S6 Active This by far is a better choice I had a note switched to this phone and it is so much easier to navigate The quality of the pictures and everything else is crystal clear Love it Ive had my Galaxy S7 I only get the odd number Galaxy devices since the day it was made available on American markets and am thoroughly enjoying it
I like the heavier more solid feel to it However with the device enveloped in glass I was afraid I would drop it and break it for about 8 days until I got an Otter Box
Fast fluid movement Clear bright display Camera is what Id hoped it would be
Battery life however is a major disappointment Thankfully the fast charging cord is pretty impressive Moving my apps from device storage to SD storage is a little bit more laborious but Im glad that it is still an option
S Voice is much more responsive Im finding it very useful
I only want my contacts automatically saved to Verizon Cloud nothing else Im frustrated that I can not find that option
The ear buds are ridiculous They are awkward shaped dont fit dont stay in and are uncomfortable Great sound if you can make them stay in I have had this new 7edge for three weeks and I find it amazing  I have kids and the kids enjoy the vivid screen when they watch Thierry you tube shows the easy one touch edge button makes my life simplerthank you Camera is great Screen and the visuals are amazing Touchwiz is better Phone is very responsive Fingerprint scanner works well Have 4 fingers programed in which is the max amount I had the Galaxy 3 so this is a huge bump up in everything possible Samsung continues to do a great job improving their phones Huge plus is the Micro SD slot back I got the 128GB to hold all my music pictures and you can put your apps on it as well if you want Only been almost 3 weeks having it and I have no complaints Only exception would be the battery life seems to drain if youre on it with hard use Usually go to sleep with about 90 battery and not charging it throughout the day I get to about 25 So not terrible and thats with moderate usage in spurts Started my day today at 84 at 6AM and its now almost 5pm and I am at 15 and that was again with moderate usage WiFi Turned off Bluetooth turned off and Location turned off as well

All in all top of the line phone and so happy I got this Just waiting on my Gear S2 since I preordered the phone Feels great in the hand performance was very good camera excellent

The battery was about the same as Note 5 and it wasnt different enough to keep from going back to my Note but for anyone one else its the perfect phone to upgrade to Perfect size and features were top notch And you can pour champagne on it

Always on display not open enough to truly be useful Ive had this phone for about a week and I love it Ive had the s7 about 2 weeks now and will say its a great improvement over my s5 especially the camera No comparison at all to the s5 I can also tell a difference in the display on my games It has better sharper colors My only gripe would be the so called biggerbetter battery It last about as long as the s5 did in power saving mode Under moderate use I have to charge it ain the afternoons But still better than an iphone low light camera is terrific i have a chocolate lab  it certainly helps his pic turn out great no mater where i snap a shot of him  since i love my dog I now also love my phone I have not yet learned how to do everything that this phone is capable of but I have been very impressed with it so far I really like this phone it is fast small and has great screen Its not fault is the sinsativity of the screen I love my new phone 
Its so full of tools and gadgets I can do everything in it I found myself using my tablet a little less Because I dont need it anymore

I always have been a Samsung person  I love all my phones but this one is soooo good looking He got me from hello   
Thank you Samsung I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 So many great apps and such great and clear pictures and videos Ive had it for over a week now Great low light pictures battery lasts over 2 days if you can put it down lasted for over a day when I first got it and had it on all the time while I was setting it up easy to do and getting used to it So many great features This is the best phone I have ever owned and I have had quite a few over the years I love all of the features It has features that are useful for every walk of life and very user friendly Its Performance is A1 definitely 5 stars The battery has a long life  dont have to worry about it going dead on me during the middle of the day Love the phones slim lightweight design The colors on the display are always so bright and vibrant A lot of phone  you definitely get your moneys worth with this one GREAT VALUE Love my phone its the best I love samsung products and have used samsung for years Bought this phone after having the S5 found there is no way to voice text anymore Very disappointed Other than that love this phone It is a lot like my Samsung S5 but has some advanced featyres The camera is very good I love this phone My galaxy 5 was great reliable and all at once it went so skipped the 6 went to the 7 Seems to out preform the 5 a lot I love this phone I upgraded from the galaxy s4 its fast a lot of cool features just an all around great phone there are only a couple things Im not fond of first its the sensitivity of the back button on my old phone I never had the problem of accidently hitting it when I was playing a game holding the phone horizontally my hand always accidently hits it the other thing is the location of where the sound comes out again my hand accidently covers it blocking the sound my other phone the speaker was on the back never was a problem besides that the phones really great the battery life is amazing it also charges very fast Very nice phone I love how they added the micro sd slot so you do not have to dish out for more money Been using the phone for a little over a month and so far I like it a lot better then the S5 I had Wireless charging is great would be nice if the included the charger with the phones though I mean seriously for the price of the phone you cant throw in a charger Just my opinion  Wish it came in the white color
 easy to navigate
 great camera My wife and my son have the iphones My daughter and I have the Samsung Galaxy phones This time I got the S7 Edge and my daughter got the S7 The S7 is really light My S7 Edge is also much lighter than my wifes 6 plus The charging is very fast about 90 minutes I also think Galaxys camera is much better than iphones This phone is a wizard It is blazing fast to use Oh and the fact charge feature is incredible The battery last much longer  usually 2 days before I need to recharge I have been a Samsung fan since my first Galaxy S4
I upgraded to the S6 and gave my wife the S4 she loved the phone and didnt want to give it up
I finally convinced her to use my Galaxy S6 as I upgraded to the S7
She loves the S6 and I love my S7
The processing power on the S7 and the smooth interface along with water resistance was a no brainer in my opinion to upgrade
I love the phone The interface is very user friendly as well as connectivity to bluetooth devices and wifi has gotten a lot easier I find that I the phone connects with all my devices usually before I even think about connecting them
They did bring back the SD card slot which was a huge plus 
They also have included some software called Game Launcher This is a great piece of software I was having some issues with an app on my phone and the support team wanted screen shots but the issue was a glitching screen that would not be caught with screenshots so I took a video of the issue and sent it to the developers 
The one negative about that sd card though is every time you restart your phone a message comes up for you to either look at the contents or to eject the card I have not looked to see if there is a way to disable this message yet I love this phone I am not a phone fanatic but the easy of the Samsung Galaxy just works for me I like the s7 because it has more memory Camera is excellent This is a beautifully designed phone feels solid and has great features Im really glad they brought back the expanded storage The phone works great Theres not as many features I thought it would have being a s7 edge The performance is great The phone has a modern operating system and has modern additions The only thing I hate about this phone is that on my s5 using the video app I was able to find nearby devices and access there libraries I have about 750 movies on my computer that I can no longer access from my phone Why did you take that feature away So far so good I like all features Still going through and learning the phone I bought this phone a few days ago and it works great Have an S4 and S5 Have not have any issues so far Ive been waiting for this phone with 64 bit OS  4gb of ram for over two years It is as fast as I knew it would be and has the fast wireless charger which is awesome The screen resolution is outstanding and the camera is also outstanding With the 200gb SDCard port it holds every picture mp3 song  video I own  more It has a few cons such as internal battery and the old mini usb charging port The entire case is made of glass which is glued together for the water resistant feature but will be impossible to open for repairs A personal con is the speaker is at the bottom of the phone and I keep covering it up while holding the phone  blocking the sound which has pretty good I was a little skeptical about not being able to remove my battery as I have had every galaxy since they began I have always experienced freeze However with the S7 I have no issues whatsoever Everything is smooth from the touch to the software to the camera and capabilities I do enjoy how the SD card was reintroduced to this phone Overall I have not one disappointment Samsung for the win What can I say The Galaxy S7 is sleek fast and full of features Paired with my Gear 2 watch and the Gear VR I have unlimited possibilities Love the features on the phone spill water on it comes right off Im a busy ER RN Carry the phone for quick look up of medication info Now I dont have to worry or carry bulk case about water hitting phone Easy to use design This is my first time having a Samsung phone I switched from an iPhone and I never want to go back I already knew some general features about the s7 edge when it launched and turns out I got more use out of it than I thought There are so many extra features that I find beneficial to my lifestyle to use The edge features help me get to what I want whenever I want and I dont even have to go back to the home page Its a great product for you to upgrade to if youre looking for something new and different I upgraded from a Samsung S5 to the S7 and its seems better across the board Although not a quantum jump better but incrementally better across the phone features
For example it seems to me like its faster has a brighter screen  feels better in my hand and has longer battery life 
 One subtle improvement is that the software seems smoother and more intuitive Could be Im just getting better at understanding Samsung

Overall terrific phone This is a powerhouse phone I came out of a Galaxy Note 2 and just didnt want to switch phones for all the data transfer that never works that great and the number of changes that just come with a new phone Took me less than 24 hours to absolutely fall in love with this phone and how smart it is A little getting used to different features but lets face it my Note was 3 years old so of course there were small differences 

I love the multiwindow option as well as the smart stay and the security features And to use the camera you can just double tap the home key and it pops right up even if the phone is sleeping Went from a s5 to a s7 edge an love it Will recommend to everyone Excellent screen clarity speed of phone and features Battery life isnt what the specs indicate Love the wireless charging Loving this new camera Took it to take some pictures this weekend and Im loving my phone even more Thanks Samsung This phone is excellent nice on hands great pictures quality Nice phone most of the features you want Samsung has a bit to go on managing apps and memory though I love everthing about my galaxy s7 The camara is great much better than the iphone 6s Literally the best phone I have ever used Its fast it looks cool it has cool features and is very unique with the curve Upgraded from my S5 and the display is so much better I am amazed by how good it looks Only downside is that Im very afraid to drop it knock on wood because of all thelse glass I do not want to shatter this masterpiece I switched to Android from IOS first going to the 6P There is a lot of hype about pure android It was nice quick and fast but soon became board with it I then went to the Note5 and finally the s7 Samsung has done a tremendous job with TW The S7 is quick and the additional functionality TW brings is outstanding Great phone however there is a lot of cutting in and cutting out while in my vehicle Doesnt matter if its in a 4G area or at home I dont like it2nd phone traded innothing can be doneI still like the phone The s7 edge seems to be a lot faster than my note 4 still going through all the new features nice phone camera is great I could go on and on but if you have a Samsung you already know how good the phones are I love it I upgraded from the S4 a day Im really loving the changes I love the upgraded camera and how easy it is Love how easy it is to connect with the Bluetooth in my vehicle I usually work very long shifts of 13 hours or more while constantly checking my phone and texting and the battery will be at 50 at the end of my shift That is the greatest positive to me I use the edge app launcher all of the time Everything I do on this phone is so quick and snappy Switched from iphone to the S7 returning to Android after many years away Everything ported over seemlessly using google tools The screen resolution is amazing the pictures and video are outstanding I couldnt be happier It holds a charge for a long time and charges very quickly with fast charging If your worried about making the switch dont be youll love it Thanks Samsung Thus is my first Samsung phone a Galaxy S7 I am thoroughly impressed I have always had Motorola Droid previous to this This phone has a battery life on part with my previous Droid Turbo The wireless and corded charging are both fast mode types which is great It feels good in my hands with the rounded edges This is definitely a premium flagship phone The feature set is good and there is not much bloatware prepackaged as some other phones have I do miss some of the Motorola gestures and abilities to activate flashlight or camera with a shake or a twist of the phone They are minor issues though Overall this is a great upgrade I cant express how happy I have been with my Galaxy S7 The slight changes in the chassis from the S6 are definitely noticeable when I am handling the phone The phone feels sturdier than the previous model and I am happy the camera is flush with the phone instead of the protruding of last years model Samsung did revert back to quadcore however the OS seems noticeably smoother than the S6 and the always awake screen is a quick and easy way to see notifications and the time without even touching your phone The camera takes amazing photos and the fact that the phone is water resistance is icing to the cake The two features which had me over the top excited is the removable memory and the battery life These were two features that frustrated me with the S6 I love that my phone can is not able to keep up with my busy life and I wont ever miss a moment again I love my new phone I can actually hear my phone calls now I love the clarity of the photos on this phone 
 I like the fact that I dont have apps on my phone which I will never use So far Im very happy with this phone I love this phone other then all the att apps that come installed that you cant get rid of but other then that I love it Ive never had a smart phone that has had so many features built in Im continually surprised just how smart this phone truly is Thank you so much The newest addition to the Samsung Galaxy lineup is probably its best The phone is lightweight incredibly fast and has a ton of great features The fingerprint scanner is easy to set up and use I love the autoadjust of brightness based on light conditions Transferring information from my old phone Note 4 to the S7 was the easiest transition between phones Ive ever had Previous to this Id owned a Note 4 that Id loved but was quite put off by last years S6 and S6 Edge models as I loved having expandable memory Bringing back that feature is what swayed me from purchasing an LG or Sony phone this year Coupled with the water resistance and the unbelievable screen quality and battery life Samsung has another huge hit on their hands with this phone I love the way this phone fits in my hand It has a good shape and size It has a big screen but not too big for my hands either I had the s3 it was good for its time Upgraded to s5 didnt have any problems for almost 2 years

S7 is definitely my favorite Fast responsive new features but same familiar feel to the device Love having the water proof feature Samsung delivers a great product in the S7 It is excellent for calls and runs apps smoothly It is easy to navigate and is loaded with feature that outstrip the competition My wife has the other guys phone and prefers mine I just got my VR set and the phone is amazing Its a great effect the phone runs these perfectly Its a good thing Samsung allows you to put a SD card in the phone again because you will need it for all the great software Great camerasuper fastwaterproof and SD card option are just some of the great things Coming from a note 4 to this is no problem I was just waiting for Samsung to make the s6 better and they made it happen Great camera and apps Awesome screen quality and design The only problem I had was my screen not turning on one time I had to hard reset it to fix that problem Other than that it runs smoothly Its my first time purchase at galaxy in my past used Iphone but i love it never change Galaxy edge 7 thanks Great features and especially the upgraded low light camera amazing make this a fantastic phone Add on that its water resistant and its got everything I want in a phone Great job on this one Samsumg I am upgrading from the Galaxy S5 I went with the S7 Edge It takes some getting used to as it is noticeably bigger Overall a great phone very similar to the S5 Very pleased overallbut battery life still sucks I like the Phone it is fast and responsive has a long lasting battery super nice display and great sound
The Phone is lacking some of the latest Tech Samsung Removed the Ir Blasted so can no longer use it to control your tv Dose not have the USB C plug Can not use the SD card for internal memory per Marshmallow specs I upgraded from my Galaxy S4 because Id outgrown it it no longer had enough space for all the apps I was using and because it seemed to be getting slower I went with the S7 instead of the S7 Edge because the Edge looked longer and it looked like the sides of the screen were distorted 

The S7 did not disappoint Its fast it has the capacity I need it came with a 64Gb SD card and it was easy to use Some of the Android conventions had changed but I expected that Overall I have no complaints It does everything that my S4 used to do only better This phone is gorgeous You literally well fall in love at first sight The design is backed up with a sturdy frame that takes a beating Beyond the looks this thing is fast We arent talking about quick animations we are taking about lighting fast load times This goes far beyond a phone This is a multimedia consumption tool Game watch play or read do it all at once This is the total package Dont forget that the battery life is world class beyond a day This contours to your hand and youll never put it down I love my GS7 Its fast powerful and has an incredible battery life The expandable memory is a huge plus and the added security that the waterproofing brings is great for peace of mind If youre looking for a new phone look no further Great features  excellent device would definitely recommend it to friends  family I bought this phone after finding it the most familiar when comparing to the big three flagships right now 6PLG5G7 Loving it Brilliant screen responsive and incredibly tactile almost too much Battery life is great if you do the defaults turn down brightness etc great phone right out of the box would reccomend I love it Ive had a galaxy 3 and a galaxy 5 The one thing I would change is I would add the ability for the consumer to change the battery Making the battery internal like it is was a mistake in my opinion I would also make the display more visible in sunlight This phone is by far the best phone Ive ever owned Its worth every penny of the cost Upgraded from a galaxy s5 active The galaxy 7 so far is so much better Great camera Love the keyboard and the newer features Even the speaker phone is louder and more clear The fingerprint scanner reacts and works better than any other phone Ive had

Having the water resistance back is a great addition and much appreciated after it was lacking in S6

Battery life is a huge improvement I am impressed by the overall design and user friendly apps on this phone Love the camera and the way you can take beautiful pictures at night Water resistant what Yes it is the battery life more than 24 hours and still going with 30 of battery hard use playing clash of clans I dont regret upgrading to this phone
Thank you samsung for this galaxy The headset for the vr is amazing and surprisingly comfortable Upgraded from s5 to s7 the camera runs faster ando overall the phone is great However two keys issues as I live in the gym I got the gear s2 and my Bluetooth headphones will not pair but after getting a brand new pair of the same headphones they paired with the phone but still not the watch Also all music apps I usehave been freezing or stopping after one song Im hoping this will be resolved once the apps catch up to the new OSwaiting for the Samsung rep to come help at my local store Had the S6 edge S7 edge even better a larger screen and better looking Excellent Product wife really likes it she is still learning how to use it Had the Galaxy 5 and loved it but the 16 gigs of internal storage was becoming annoying Waited for the S7 and very glad I did 32 is always better than 16 even with the SD card It is fast and the display is gorgeous Love the alwayson feature especially since I use it as a bedside clock No need to wake it up to tell me the time I got the gold case and it is beautiful Having read reviews I immediately added a glass screen protector and a clear case that keeps the beauty of the phone Havent taken many photos yet but the few I have are very good So Ive had it a little over a week and on day 5 the screen went blank until I had Verizon support to help me restart it also wont play videos sometimes people Im on the phone with cant hear me at timesnot reception and now my messaging notification is not working none of the tones are Im not very happy with this phone at all Charges super fast and the camera is great thats about it  The camera launches super quick and takes beautiful crisp pictures The display on this phone is bright vibrant and crisp as well I love the fact that they brought back the SD card which is a big selling point for me I love that I can change the theme from my settings and the fact that it came with Microsoft right out of the box The fingerprint scanner reads perfectly and makes Samsung pay apps that I want locked and the lock screen very easy for me to unlock Gaming on this phone is absolutely incredible especially in multiplayer Ive got to say this has got to be the best phone on the market The biggest downsides are the size and screen ironically Especially when you have the curved edge screen I have big hands and have trouble using such a large screen with one hand like is common for many cell phone users It only gets harder with the curved edge and extremely sensitive screen Although even after a few days I had gotten better at it and after a few weeks now I feel like a pro again  its all about being a bit more careful and decisive with your movements and how you hold it To be clear I really like the screen its just a bit much to handle at times

The edge screen is so useful even from the lock screen Every week I see more panels added to the app store I even find myself picking up my phone and using it just to swipe through my apps and notifications knowing that there is nothing for me to do The phone is smooth and just fun to use Apps function better and the QC is better than ever I can connect to my tablet watch computer or headphones in seconds without stopping what Im doing either in life or on my phone The battery is the tone pillar this phone needed to tie it all together Everything that the phone could do would be meaningless if it only lasted half a day but with this battery and the tweaks to save power this phone is a real beast Android Pay Samsung Pay and the fingerprint scanner are incredibly useful but the best part is that they can only get better and more useful with time The powerful cameras and easy double tap on on the home button are super fun to take pictures and videos with and the magnifyer is a fun little toy 

I love the Galaxy S7 edge and could not be happier with how its turned out The only ways to make it better are to get accessories like the Gear S2 Galaxy Level On Wireless Pro or wireless charger all three of which I have I cant wait to see what updates and additions you guys make in the future This phone is simply amazing and easy to use that almost anyone could use this phone Whether this would be your first or last android phone this is the perfect choice of phone that is currently on the market I hesitate when it comes to new tech mainly because every month it seems like there is a new upgrade I am glad I made the switch to the S7 though I love the expanded memory and new features The sleek design is a bonus There have been two system updates in the two weeks Ive had mine At least they seem to be working on it
Id speculate that most of the problems are with Marshmallow
No viable migration path from my Droid Razr HD
Problems with USB and WiFi to PC transfers
Incomplete User Guide I have yet to speak with a tech support person who has been trained on the device
Lets hope it gets better I purchase the S7 as an upgrade from my Note 3 I thought I was going to miss the huge Note screen and the S pen but the fact I can add extra storage is the best thing ever I now use the Message app instead of the text message thats standard and I love the VW Message app But all in all I dont really miss the Note or the S Pen The phone is fun and sleek I have not tried the water test as I tend not put my phone in water but if my hands are wet I am not worried if I need to answer a call I do miss the feature that allows me to wave my hand over the phone and answer the call but thats just one feature I have been a Galaxy girl for many years now and they just keep getting better Have never considered a different brand Love everything about my S7 Edge I upgraded from the S5 about two weeks And have had a great experience up to this point Love the camera I think the battery life is great Love everything about it No problems yet Ive had my S7 Edge for almost 2 weeks now and I love Easy to operate great functionality and apps worked seamlessly Really like the Edge feature too I have been htc for years Finally took the plunge lol Very pleased with s7 Intuitive and ergonomic Just makes good sense This is a greatt product because the camera is fanaminal It has great sound and video quality I brought this phone about 3 weeks ago I am so happy I did I had the Samsung Galaxy 5 but this S7 is so much better Even the Camera is so much better Thank you Samsung for coming out with such an awesome phone This phone has everything you would expect from Samsung plus a few newbies I love this device Im a die hard Samsung user I love its sleek design it is very lightweight and the camera is ridiculous I have been waiting for a phone like this I am loving this product and how seamlessly it works with my other Samsung products Ive been using Galaxy S for awhile This phone is a great cell to use I love this phone It is better then the s6 phone I loved my S5 but I accidentally melted it so was forced into upgrading Figured if I was going to get a new one may as well go with newest technology Im still learning about some of the features and there are some Ill never use It has a nice feel to it  I hated to add a case to it adds weight but I also dont want to ruin another phone The doubled up locking feature is very annoying since I use the phone as am alarm but there may be a way around that that I havent figured out yet Its fast the display is clear the speaker is tinny but louder I still havent figured out how to access  play my music and dont understand why my voicemail files show up in my music file anybody have an answer to that but my biggest gripe is the battery life All the pro reviews raved about a super long battery life  socalled fast charge but this thing eats battery like crazy even with a lot of hoggy apps turned off and it doesnt charge any faster than my S5 Another couple weeks of use  I should have a better opinion I like this phone but I dont love it yet This phone is the best phone Ive ever owned It has many great attributes including long battery life a clear bright screen fast and smooth movement and it is super thin The best feature though is its amazing camera I just took a trip to Costa Rica and some of the pictures look better than any post card My friends with Iphones were blow away by the quality of photos and the bright sharp display In fact they were amazed by how much more bright and clear the screen is in direct sunlight compared to their IPhone 6s The fact it is waterproof is just gravy Another great feature is the ability to double tap the control button and instantly have the camera ready to go without having to unlock the screen I absolutely love this phone and highly recommend it I have had my phone a month and I love it mainly because it stays charged unlike my previous one I love the externalook storage and that it is water resistant One issue I have is a few apps are not compatible or do not work as well with this phone It is new so maybe it will get better Love the video call featurethe camera takes great low light pictures and slow motion video as well Very good battery life Love the idea can add a memory card Overall awesome product I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  Its everything and more in a smart phone I had ever expected The price of phones I think are over rated other than that  HAPPY CUSTOMER  I love the phone but I have to reset it after the power button stopped working after the update and I dont like how it doesnt back everything up to a cloud the way my iphone did I think thats one thing that needs work is the sync on the phone 
I love that it came with headphones and that they made it water resistant again and the screen is just awesome and I have found the camera works better than the iPhone 6s plus it seems to take better pictures Love the phone until I come home and try to receive or make voice calls Reception is very poor The camera is great battery life is good and like the style Just upgraded from the S6 Edge  that I was very happy with but with limited memory
In my S7 Edge I added the 200GB actual 183Gb SD card and now have TONS of storage for pictures movies and related VR stuff
If you never used VR there NO reason not to anymore with the Gear VR
Highly recommended
Fast performance
Long lasting battery with FAST recharge Im on my second Galaxy 7 The phone keeps rebooting itself wi fi calling drops calls and people cannot hear you speaker quality is poor and has a rattle to it Both of them had the same issues I am running away from Samsung as fast as I can Samsung customer service is in the Philippines and you cannot understand them except for a few words in each sentence very frustrating with Samsung with their poor customer service and all their problems This phone is fast cool and I love the battery life and the fast charging I really want to love this phone but I cannot until the kinks are worked out Hopefully they will be fixed with some small system updates I am having trouble with connectivity as well as account linking Applications like Facebook Google and LinkedIn are not linking with this device nor my contacts as with my old S5 phone This is an issue when looking for specific contact information without having to go to the actual application I have heard these applications do not work well with Marshmallow yet but I hope that changes SOON Also I keep getting notifications that my SD card is installed Thats pretty annoying Other than that I love it I have only had this phone for a few weeks but so far it charges really fast I have had some issues with it being a little slow im guessing that there was a bug but I am confident that Samsung can fix this problem I changed from an iPhone for another Samsung device and I will never go back to the dreaded iPhone There are more places that you can take your phone if there is a problem and not to mention the customer services is much better I switched to the Samsung Galaxy series a few years ago This is the first line of smartphones that I really like My husband had an old droid and he was very happy with it until he saw my Galaxy s4 When the s5 came out I upgraded and he took my s4 Then when I upgraded to the s6 he took my s5 Now that I have the s7 he is eyeing the same model The phone is thin and has a lot of settings that I really like I protect my phone with the tempered glass and find the screen very easy to clean after my 10 year old gets a hold of it We just returned from a trip and on the plane we were able to watch movies via the Google Movies app After watching 2 movies there was still plenty of battery power left to watch more I love this phone Performance is very similar very little difference Works very well but so did S6 Battery life is disappointing no better than S6 Often wont last a full day Autobrightness seems much better than S6 works well even on bright days I had the S5 but due to unfortunate events I had to get the S7 quicker than expected The phone is great 
Pros
Love how any email with an appointment syncs to my phone and reminds me of the appointment
Great and clear camera for pictures and videos
Great speaker for music
Removable expandable storage
Cons 
 A little to sensitive to the touch I can barely touch the screen and something happens It can get a little annoying when you type or surfing 
 The fingerprint reader is too much with having to do a backup password pin or pattern I would prefer to just be able to use my fingerprints without all the extra steps Look at how the S5 did not ask all those questions I would prefer that Ive been using the S7 for over a month I always out my phones through the ringer to see if they can keep up So far this one does The VR also compliments it Amazing and fast phone My only wish is that Samsung release the update for the Gear S2 so I may be able to utilize the Samsung pay thats on my phone on my watch I previously had a Galaxy S3 and upgrading to the S7 is just what the doctor ordered

Its pretty good in terms of performance and capabilities A waterproof phone is a surprisingly useful feature since I can clean my phone

The only thing I wish I had was a removable battery and adoptable storage Technically adoptable storage is available with a hacky solution but there is some bugs involved with it I think Also there is an issue using the NFC sync when setting up a new phone that introduced a random reset bug in the S7 I had to factory reset my phone and set up everything manually to solve the issue

Speakers are also not placed well because most of the time youre hands will cover them But since I would use headphones anyway this is not an issue Also the display is gorgeous I have really enjoyed this phone so far Pictures and videos of my 10 month old grandson are great
I also work on my smartphone and the S7 is working great for everything I have to do I was tempted to also get a LG G5 just because I like to try all of the newest LG and Samsung phones but I really dont see any reason this time There really isnt much to entice me to get the LG G5 for my use Im really happy with this next generation of Galaxy I feel like a lot of performance improvements were made I think my favorite part is the amazing camera honestly Its so crisp the color is great and I have no troubles focusing This phone is thin and very light It looks gorgeous and it performs as beautifully Everything is sharp and snappy  which I really appreciate 

The only thing I noticed was that sometimes some of my games lag a bit Not a lot but Im starting to wonder if its maybe because I enabled that app that sits on top of your games I love it because it lets me mute notifications while I play my games  because nothing is more obnoxious than losing a team game than getting a text or message that can wait  but Im beginning to wonder if thats a cause of the slight graphics lag I see As a frequent traveler and a Note 3 owner for the last several years the Note 3 is a great product With the expandable memory ability to add an additional battery SVoice and other apps one couldnt be happier with the Note 3Until upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge

The Galaxy S7 Edge has it all A long battery life expandable memory thanks for bringing this back improved SVoice and many other apps not available to older equipment The battery can easily last throughout the day and into the evening  The expandable memory is great to store apps photos movies documents SVoice is also a refreshing way to use the phone 

The addition of video calls is a big welcome too and certainly expected to grow with the Galaxy product line 

The Edge screen offers a unique way to access apps and even individual functions within some of the apps Shortcuts to contact favorites tools score stock updates and more are all there at the touch of a finger Nice job

If you dont own a Galaxy S7 Edge today you should tomorrow I like that Samsung has brought back the SD card slot for additional storage and that combined with the larger battery of the S7 Edge really pushes this phone to the front of the line I have owned 4 android phones including the Galaxy S7 and this is by far the best iteration yet The camera is phenomenal the performance is incredibly snappy and the display is crisp and clear The design is a bit slippery yet comfortable A simple case can fix the former I am very happy with the fact that Samsung decided to bring back the expandable storage And the integral wireless charging is very convenient feature All in all I am very pleased with this device I have had the S7 for nearly 3 weeks now I love the model and the phone itself however I have noticed that the two apps I use the most function horribly on this phone These apps are snapchat and S health I use S health for monitoring my exercise and eating and the update for the app really affects how I feel about the device For some reason I am unable to see most peoples snapchats also and I am unsure of why this is Beautiful device but not functioning as well as my S6 I like to listen to music iHart and the phone will just crash and restartits not hot and the memory is not overrunAlso the screen seems responsive wile you are touching it but if you lift your finger good chance the next letter you hit will not register It is like the screen falls into power save mode in a second

Outside of thatworks great Pretty awesome phone It takes the IP68 from the S5 to a new and improved phone I havent seen anything I dont like yet Ive had it since the release date The camera is a lot quicker when it comes to focusing due to the dual pixels so worth losing a few megapixels in my opinion But I would like to see the dual pixels coupled with a 16 MP camera if possible Overall no complaints I have had numerous Samsung phones and this one by far takes the cake The call clarity screen resolution functionality and design all combined with the accessibility of the edge puts this phone light years beyond the competition I am indeed a Samsung user for life I have had this phone for 3 weeks and everyday Im learning something new I have come to appreciate the Edge features along with the larger screen size I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 and was not planning to upgrade due to the features the S5 carried When I started reading the specs of the S7 I had to try it This phone has not disappointed The features along with the IP68 grading told me Samsung was listening to its customers The fact Samsung brought back the expandable memory with the IP68 grading told me it was time to upgrade This phone is fast has an amazing screen fits perfectly in your hand and the cameras are top notch All of these new features extremely fast hardware running the latest Android OS Marshmallow makes this phone in my opinion the best Galaxy phone ever released to date This is by far the best phone yet I live the features and it is the has the best style Battery last so much longer and I love the security of knowing that if it should get wet it is so much more protected from damage than any other phone This phone has many great features For me having a phone that can keep up with me and my 2 kids was a must This phone has very little to no lag when texting or searching the Internet I had a note 4 prior and it was constantly lagging With the s7 it is click and go The camera quality is really well I love all the features on the camera and how you can make videos slow motion or speed them up I really like the over all layout of the phone And how you can change themes to give your phone a more personalized looked All settings are easily accessible and not confusing I also love that the speakers are not on the back of the phone They are on the bottom Front screen speakers would be ideal but I can work with bottom Being dust and water resistant was huge for me since I have young children Ive already had water spilled on it and nothing happen The S7 edge has been great so far The fact that it automatically comes with 32gb is fabulous  no more worrying about which apps can stay and which must go 

Also the battery is amazing It can almost go a full 24 hours with no charge and thats with heavy usage 

The new autofocus on the camera is phenomenal I can take instant shots now without having to wait for autofocus  its sooo fast The clarity even on zoom is great I am very satisfied with this upgrade it has performed well in all aspects but the battery life This could use improvement it gets me through the day with a fair amount of usage but heavy use could leave me with a paper weight i am happy so buy it I am enjoying the S7 thus far EXCEPT every time I turn on my bluetooth the DrivingMode comes on but I might be sitting at my desk or sitting in a chair That seems to be my only problem at this time Ive had this phone for about two weeks now and admittedly it is my first Droid but I am disappointed in the features that I lost in my Windows phone  the issues syncing calendars incomplete transfer of contactsdata no availability of incoming text announcementreading Love the display and the colors but for the price I would not go there again Im so in love with my new Galaxy S7 Love all the new features the feel and how fast it works Ive linked my work email to it and have absolutely nothing bad to say Love this phone only issue is I went to answer it one day and the screen went black and never came back on Thank goodness for it being under warranty Waiting for my new device now Seems like a great improvement over S4  longer battery good speakers for a phone One problem  we cant get it to properly connect to a laptop through a usb connection Technical support could not fix it The new features are awesome from the improvements from the camera to the power saving mode My battery last all day on that mode with no problems The feel of the phone is awesome it fits perfectly in your hand I love the edge it has way more options and opens fluidly The screen repels water which makes it a plus as well I am a big fan of Samsung products and this one has not let me down I was a little concerned that I wouldnt like the larger format but its been great The sound of the phone is much better than any Ive had in the past  both for making calls and listening to music I havent had any issues with it The body is sturdy its held up after being dropped several times Not as much performance improvement over the S5 as I anticipated but it is faster The most glaring disappointment with the phone though is the exceptionally poor battery life While I have my sight I work with many whom do not and they all love the galaxy S7 With Svoice they can use their phones for absolutely from making conference calls to getting walking directions or just your every day use of the phone It has made me aware of all the extra features that galaxy offers and I myself make use of these Especially when on the highway and I want to be safe The battery life is unbelievable I can get almost 2 and sometimes 3 days from one quick charge and I use my phone a lot Screen size is great Still fits in your pocket yet big enough to read with Oh and the camera on the S7 is great Very clear and sharp photos I waited to upgrade until the S7 came out and couldnt be happier The 3 month wait was a killer but well worth it No way would I ever go to another brand Ill be sticking with the galaxy and just keep upgrading I went from an S4 to an S7 Im so happy with this new version I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 I upgraded from the S5 and the difference especially in the camera area is significant and great The S5 camera was very disappointing This one is outstanding Im an amateur photographer using a Canon 70D so used to good photos and Im very happy with this phones capability I have had the S7 for three weeks now and absolutely glad I upgraded from the S3 It took some setting up however it was worth the time This model is light and slim I went with the wireless charger and have had no problems with it There are so many ways to set up your phone you may get confused at first however settings are easy to change The only complaint is the battery life is not long and you have to make sure the background light is turned down to preserve the battery life and applications are not running all the time The battery will last all day for the most part At first I was skeptical on getting the s7 edge because I was not a fan of the direction they were going but after playing around on the phone I decided to get ithe It exceeded my expectations by quite a bit Ill definitely buy again next year I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Uber fast system ease of use solid phone camera is amazing taking crystal clear and stunning photos Help is always at your fingertips tips Easy mode is great for us new to Samsung Galaxy phones standard mode is here I come

At this moment I cant say a bad word or find one con about my phone If you dont know someone who has one so you can see it hands on run to your nearest store that carry them and try one out You will fall in love with this multifunctional stylish and amazing phone Samsung has been my favorite since my first S2 I have never thought twice about my first purchase years ago There is no other brand I would ever purchase again After being a Windows phone user for years I must say this S7 is a bit of a revelation I hadnt picked up a Android phone in years and I am really impressed on how far the OS has come over the years
I have used this phone for nearly 3 weeks without a single glitch So far its been fast smooth and of course it has that gorgeous screen that beats anything I have used before A very good camera SD slot and water resistance make this the best all around phone I have owned yet

 I would recommend a case and insurance though As sharp looking as this phone is being all glass it might not survive multiple drops on hard surfaces But thats just the nature of the beast and for me function definitely beats form

Kudos Samsung great job TOTALLY AWESOME GREAT FEATURES FAST CHARGING SLIM TAKES AWESOME PICTURES EVEN IN LOW LIGHTING SAMSUNG FAN FOR LIFE I really do like this phone Its faster and holds way more data once upgraded then my old note 2 But I travel and Im usually on the edge of the coverage area as is This was RARELY a problem with my old note 2 but I experience a lot more dropped calls with the S7 then I ever did with my Note 2 So if you live and or work on the edge of service this may not be the phone for you I was afraid to get another samsung when the first galaxy that I had burn me but the new s7 was a chance I took and am so glad I did I love the size and the feel to itI also love the clarity in the sound as well as the picture qualityand I love how secure it is and the fact that you can unlock it with a finger printthis was the best investment made from originally l leaving to coming backgreat job samsung Im loving this new phone I had a galaxy 5 and this is by far way better Still learning things but I like it so far Switched from my note 4 to the S7  Both devices are great  Love the camera on the S7 best camera so far Durable device and the water proof is a plus Bought it to replace an iphone Found this to be not too huge in a time when most phones start to look like you have a dinner plate against your face when you talk on them The touch screen is ultrasensitive most of the time when I try to swipe between screens something opens Calls seem to lose volume and drop mid conversation in places that had no coverage issues before The phone seems to work great as soon as I call back The battery typically can make it though the day Great features especially water resistance and expandable memory Great battery life also I just love this phone It is so BEAUTIFUL and so easy to use  Best smartphone yet I love it I have not a flaw At all I traded my iPhone 6s in for the s7 and Im beyond satisfied Im in love with my S7 I love the camera It takes outstanding photos A great phone While I have really enjoyed the S7 it continues to have issues staying connected with WiFi despite 2 updates that were supposed to fix this issue Its frustrating when in the middle of working on something or listening to music  all the sudden it drops its WiFi connection I otherwise like the ease of using this phone Pros Great storage capacity call quality is amazing low light pictures improved daughter loves new kids mode new multi window features are useful screen size is larger by a small bit
Cons battery life hasnt improved runs hotter than s5 when using GPS location features charge speed is slow especially compared to s5 speed charger curved glass on regular s7 phone screen has left screen edges vulnerable about 18 inch on all sides since temperedballistic glass covers do not curve and havent yet accommodated for it so I had to get a wallet phone cover in addition to the ballistic glass cover for extra protection of the screen I replace the Samsung 5 with the 7 great choice battery stays up faster response great finger prints recogniction Overall the phone works great its fast and the design has a nice feel in your hand added bonus is the water proof feature how many people can say there phone has that right I love customizing my Samsung products and the reliability of what I get I was a little wary when the s6 came out without some features I had in the s5 but the s7 has really reeled me back 
What Im hoping for is a fix with the touchscreen It isnt what Im used to although its not entirely horrible Would I turn down the s7 for this Nope 
Camera is awesome Video is awesome the wireless charging is great Oh and Im super excited for that gear vr I love the multiple windows and use the s health everyday and the google play this is the best phone So glad I purchased it The camera is as impressive as Samsung claims I have only had a couple low light pictures not exceed the quality of the HTC camera I miss the hover pop up feature that I used to have on my previous galaxy Also missing is the continuous scroll through for the home screens and apps Best phone ever love the waterproof future love the covered I love the Samsung Galaxy s7 it has great sound and picture Let me start off by saying I really like my phone Best thing is the camera Thats the best camera Ive ever seen on a cell phone This phone is lightweight and so smooth The colors look great on the screen Bigger memory is a plus and thank you for bringing back the memory card expansion The feature with screenshots is great

On to the issues Theres some lag in some things and Ive turned animation off so not sure what thats about Then theres the issue with WiFiBluetooth and the internet If the Internet is not responding and you have Bluetooth on and its not connected then you will need to turn it off so that you can use the Internet This is a serious flaw Then theres the case of the alarm sometimes making noise and others all you get is a vibrate no matter how loud its turned up Yet another flaw The calendar is a little different as well Theres not an option to set how long the snooze will last Theres definitely some bugs to be worked out I struggled with the short battery life with my previous phone I had to carry a power bank and charge the phone more than 2 times at work

s7 edge battery is wonderful I am in love with my new S7 Its everything I wanted and more This is the best phone I have ever owned the camera is great and the phone has some really cool features that Im still exploring yall hit a home run with this one and thanks for making it water resistant I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to this phone and I love it It is fast and has lots of fun features I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The battery life is awesome It last twice as long as my last phone The camera takes better pictures and the resolution on my phone screen is much better It also has a bigger memory storage I like the size and look of the phone and I havent really had any problems with it I would recommend it to anyone Love the phone Its pretty fast has a great display expandable memory and so on Purchased 2 weeks ago replaced the S4 Biggest glitch is with photo editing  it keeps freezing on a frequent basis While the photos are great and I like the editing function  when it works Phone doesnt come with Facebook app  whats up with that Lastly agree with the reviewer that wrote that the battery runs down quickly replaced the S6 Edge with the S7 better battery better storage same Samsung quality Bought it 2 weeks ago and returned due to lack luster performance Out of the box the S7 can be buggy The antenna is inferior to that of the S5 I have had more dropped calls with this phone in one week than 17 years of service even with a new sim card added The notifications that cant be turned off can be annoying The bright spot of this phone is its camera The point and shoot feature is a refreshing addition to the Galaxy line The pictures and screen are far superior than that of its predecessors  I really like the phone except for the bug that I am trusting will be patched soon It is really a pain to turn the Bluetooth off all the time in order for wifi to work correctly and then remember to turn it back on in order for it to work with the car Never had a problem like that with my S3 The Galaxy S7 is a great phone The finger print scanner is one of my most favorite features It works flawlessly I used the Samsung pay app for the first time this past week the clerk behind the counter saw it for the first time and said technology smirking I have small kids so being waterproof is a huge benefit Overall I love this phone for way too many reasons to mention here A nice upgrade from a S5 Nice feel slim design microSD Love it Really enjoy the phone Great screen size and the phone feels comfortable in your hands I like the fact you can add extra storage and otg works wonderful to transfer files reminds me of the galaxy s5 I wish it had a bigger screen and a different design I would definitely recommend the galaxy s7 Samsung has been my daily driver phone since the S3 days This is another addition and will carry that trend for the next stretch of time The phone looks and feels good although as a right handed typer the location of the lock button is not ideal for me but when holding the phone in the left hand it lines up great The jury is out on the glass front and back but with that said it is gorilla glass so we will see how well it fairs Picture and camera both line up with what I expect from my samsung phones The quick charge feature is nice but I would have traded that for a bigger battery Still learning but so far I like this phone alot I absolutely love this phone The new features surpass anything else Ive ever had Samsung has done the impossible made a great phone that much better the design is very flashy and sleek there are tons and tons of features such as multi window 3D pictures and built in health monitors It also has a lot of cool devices you can connect to it such as all the Samsung gear like the smart watches and the VR gear All around this phone is fast  compatible and pretty simple to use The new camera enhancements really make for a clearer better photo which is honestly my favorite part of the phone I wouldnt want any other phone and cant wait to see what Samsung comes out with next I found this device is lacking a few features from the S5 however it is leaps and bounds abovery the S6 The camera has been fantastic The low lighting in my home is no longer a problem for me when I want to take a photo without the flash The phone has been super fast I love the video quality as well The video focuses quickly and picks up sound better than my s5 did The advance calling is super clear I can hear things in the background that I wouldnt be able to hear with any previous phone Ive had Overall I love the phone I recommend it to most people Love the clearer screen Upset the screen scratched in less than a week  So much for gorilla glass Dont like that it tends to skip when you are scrolling Otherwise happy with the phone BEATS APPLE Ive been using Samsung products for about 5 years Always reliable I have a tab 3 that also works like a champ I am had several people buy Samsung Galaxy products based on my recommendation They also come to me with questions and I help them get things set up The galaxy s7 is a great phone Still a lot to uncover but the little tricks I learn is helpful What a step up from my Galaxy S5 Still water resistant but now its metallic and looks that much classier The main selling point for me was the amazing camera I can take burst shots that auto focus so quickly I can capture the smile on everyones face in a group shot with all their eyes still open The hyperlapse and slow motion features are awesome not to mention the ability to adjust white balance and manually focus makes using my camera more exciting and worthwhile plus with the automatic 32gb and the option to put in a memory card making home videos is more readily available The memory card is so easy to replace too I dont even need to charge my phone every night Plus when I do charge it the fast charger allows it to go from 0 to 100 percent in a little over an hour and a half Also the speaker is much better quality listening to music or videos from my phone is so much more enjoyable The audio is always crisp and clear Also the microphone is so much better I used to get complaints that I was talking to softly but I havent heard that complaint once The SpO2 sensor on SHealth is also a nice added touch the Galaxy apps are updated to better fit my needs Compared to the old S5 this phone is a breeze So much more at my fingertips I used Samsung Pay for the first time today and I cant believe how smooth it was My only qualm is that I really miss having a remote sensor maybe Samsung will bring it back sometime I absolutely recommend purchasing this phone it has been such a good investment not bad at all best samsung yet love the edge get one So far I have enjoyed the transition to a smart phone with the Galaxy S7 which with the Easy Mode has made it much easier I still have a way to go but each step so far has been rewarding and very helpful in everyday life High quality feel Great camera So many features I am still learning This is my 3rd Galaxy products I have had in the past 7 years I have tried iphones and windows phones and I keep coming back to the Galaxy phone Great features very easy to use user friendly and is a Galaxy Great phone Easy to use with great features The phone is very fast beautiful and sleek I have one big problem with my phone If you have the blue tooth and the WIFI on at the same time you cannot access the internet I am waiting for Samsung to fix the problem Great phoneLove the features and easy of useGood upgrade  investment Samsung Galaxy S7 rocks Has everything you could possibly need and more Fast charging vivid screen amazing camera great features Great response Went from s6 to this s7 And I am highly impressed The memory it great on this phone But the performance isnt so great Phone is constantly restarting outta nowhere for no reason Easter weekend just passed and I will have memories of my grandchildren playing and Easter egg hunting with snap shots on the fly that are impeccable While they were running playing laughing in motion pictures were priceless Cant wait for our pool to open to get photos by the pool and not worry about splashing This is the best Smart Phone ever  I use to have an Iphone and this phone is way better than Iphone I was tired of the same thing and this phone have a lot need features This product has great features fantastic camera Love my new Galaxy S7 Love the fact they brought back the removable SD card Love that it is water proof Love the gold colorvery chic
LOVE the themesLOVE the camera
But feel like for the price I paidwe could have had a bit more I love the great screen it is a bright and clear screen  Absolutely love the fact you can add more memory with the micro SD card  The fact that it is water resistant is an added bonus  We have loved all the Samsung products for years now all the products have been great and when there was a problem they took care of it fast and friendly  The s7 really does have it all great features easy to use I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S5 The change is uncanny Better everything Wireless charging water resistant better camera more features larger storageI highly recommend picking one up Still thin and manageable This phone is so easy to use And isnt that what everyone is looking for these days Easy to use super fast and did I tell you that I taught my mother to use it Its her first smart phone ever This phone is everything you could ever hope for I love it Would buy again Battery life is awesome I had this phone for just about two weeks and Iam really satisfied overall with this product I really love the fantastic display and the screen size Also Im very pleased to see water resistance and SD card support finally make a return because those were very important features to me be because my last phone was the Galaxy S5 and I was really used to those features The camera experience was the best I have seen on a smartphone especially in low light My favorite experience is the battery life and I can easily last up to two full days and with fast charging and ultra power saving mode there is no way I could have my phone die on me in the middle of the day Overall I really love this device and I highly recommend it The galaxy s7 is amazing The build is very nice and durable while the internals are very fast I have to say I usually am not one to buy the latest and newest technology out there Reason being the newest isnt always the greatest I have been a Samsung owner for a few years and I would end up buying an older model to save money The time came to replace my phone now it was time to figure out which one to buy
The Samsung Galaxy s7 had only been out for a few weeks at this time I was curious so I took a look at the reviews and features I was definitely turned on
The next step was to go to the store and try this thing out 
Once I had it in my hand I was hooked The screen was a nice size but still easy to hold and lightweight The colors and picture clear and crisp 
Going through the features was a lot of fun The camera is so sharp takes amazing pictures I was also surprised to find out that the Samsung Galaxy s7 is water resistant which was a big plusI cant tell you how many times Ive had to use the rice over night trick to zap moisture out of my phone The sound quality was great and could reach a high volume for music and streaming
After my test run I decided to buy the phone I have had the s7 for a few weeks now and love it This phone has a great battery life and charges so fast I am very happy with this purchase and still find more to love every day 
I definitely recommend the Samsung Galaxy s7 to anyone looking for the right phone to buyespecially those frugal people out there like me who want the best quality for the right price The camera is AMAZING I upgraded from the galaxy s5 and Im so happy with my purchase I opted to skip on the s6s6 edges6 edge because I didnt like that I was not able to expand the memory I am obsessed with taking pictures of my daughter and nephews so memory is a HUGE deal for me With the S7 edge I am able to expand my memory which makes it the perfect phone for my needs Very cool features camera  storage expandable Always been a Samsung Galaxy fan and the s7 is impressive I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 edge for the longer battery life and more weather resistant features Can now make it all day without charging while still having the great edge features Great phone I have had the S7 for 3 weeks now It is much faster than my old HTC One M8 I like its slightly smaller size The camera is awesome

There are way too many pros to list

I hope in upcoming updates Samsung adds arrow keys to the keyboard and also works more towards improving ease of moving around between texting to calls to contacts to recent calls This has to be by far the greatest device yet from Samsung Everything about the Galaxy s7 is just amazing Ive had the phone for a month now and simply love it No problems no issuesperiod
Simply a very good phone  Great phone so far Love the features and the battery life Only issue was having to replace the phone within a few days of purchase due to the power and down volume buttons that stopped working Same issue with the replacement a few days later I Googled the problem and found it was a known issue that a reboot would remedy Probably need to get that information out to the stores Also just received an update maybe the fix is there I love the feel of the phone It fits great in my hand I love that the new s7 hasee a better camera and the video call lets me keep intouch with my family while Im away I also love the HD calling its such a grateful sounding quality I love this phone I always had an iPhone but this is a game changer Sticking with the galaxy I switched to this phone after complaining about the horrible battery life of the S6 The S7 was suppose to have improvement on battery life That is true but the life of the battery is still poor I use my phone for the basics Social media some pinterest phone calls and email The phone is great otherwise and I do not see any reason for the phone not to last at least a whole day I will not be getting another samsung phone I am done with the high priced phones that can not hold a simple charge for a whole day Great phone Would have been much better if the Exynos variant had been sold in the US Overheats when using it with the Gear VR It very light weighted and has a lot of great features I like the look and feel The features are easy to use and understand Love the Samsung pay easy to set up and use Easily integrated with all my devices Way to go I received my new galaxy s7 edge just days before leaving on vacation to Hawaii Even though I was unfamiliar with it I took absolutely amazing pictures Everyone that has seen them comment that they look professional I have had no problems adjusting to the edge screen Very easy to use I would and have already recommend this to everyone I know Love it This is an awesome phone I came from an iPhone and turns out I should have made that switch a long time ago This new Samsung Galaxy S7 is the bomb Love how its able to be ok if it gets wet which is very important to me for my job This phone is very quick and the split screen is beautiful I love that its not as big as some of the other phones out there it just fits perfectly in my hand There is nothing I can say bad about this phonebest investment Ive made Its fast and powerful The battery is amazing The screen automatically changes when the light changes The features are good Nice Pricey though The edge stuff is really cool I LOVE THIS PHONE It is a perfect blend of the s5 and s6 with loads of refinement Battery is improved ergonomics improved camera improved RAM management improved

I cannot recommend this enough If you are considering an Android this should be the top of your list Very happy with the Galaxy S7 Screen is great  I can even play hidden object games on it Camera is fast and handles lowlight well as promised Battery life adequate I wish I had known that the Edge version has a larger battery that might have made me upgrade to that I havent tested out its water resistance nor the SD Card option but I am glad those features are there
I really appreciated the smooth upgrade from the S4 I had the Verizon folks do the move for me and everything moved logons to WiFi hotspots text message exchanges etc OK a couple of games reset back to level 1 I can deal with that
Best of all of course is that I now have room for ALL my apps in main memory Great battery life wonderful camera quick to charge long battery life Only wish that sound notifications of text messages etc could be heard while on the phone I was switching from a Samsung Note 3 Issues I had with the Note was bad camera and bad battery life The S7 Edge definitely has neither of these issues I was pleasantly surprise that it could last the whole day with me actually using it playing games checking social media Camera quality beats out my wifes iPhone 6S at low light I was taking video at a school dance party at low light and it looked really good The iPhone couldnt even get a clear image because it was too dark

The phone feels solid Colors look vibrant The width has the right fit for my hands I also played with the wireless charging on a Spigen docking station and it worked perfectly

Things I didnt like well more like didnt care about was the curved edges They were easy to activate by accident since they were so close to the edge Putting the phone in a case will fix that problem easy

Though this phone was expensive I would definitely buy this phone again Love that the sd card feature is back It is so easy to upgrade to The screen size is perfect I Love it I upgraded from s4 to s7and so very pleased No huge change from the layout so was easy to transition but the features are so much more appreciated Battery is great for me all I do is adjust settings when Im not using draining features and set it back when I am Ive had plenty of battery life Love this phone Had 2 weeks Works great Fast No issues I love the new Samsung Galaxy S7 its everything I want in a phone and more Cant wait to test my new Gear VR with my new phone The S7 is very easy to use for new comers and for the people that are already introduced to the Samsung family The new design is sleek and fits in my hands perfect Im really excited about my new phone I love it I am new to the Samsung Galaxy phone I have never used the android and was pleased how easy it was to navigate and teach myself on the Samsung Galaxy S7 I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone And I am happy I made the choice to purchase the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone Love the camera but wont hold a signal at home or work and dropschool every phone call Sumsung should stop putting features you cannot get rid of like the bursting shot in the past the Flipboard and magazine I am testing this phone and I will install another camera pp I might have to return it The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge has lists of features that I think are amazing The camera takes some of the best pictures I seen love how fast it comes into focusI would recommend this phone to anybody that is looking so many different things to do and use on this phone On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate it a very well high ten I am coming from a HTC One m8 with previous experience with Samsung smartphones There are few things that I dislike The camera is great the battery life is great and the speed is great The one thing that could be improved in my opinion is the fingerprint reader I have trouble with it reading my thumb and often have to place my finger on the home button multiple times I replaced my 4 th iPhone upgrade with this S7 I am still learning the android system but I am loving the power the reception clarity the camera and the standard features Now help me replace my iPad forever and I am sold I love my new Galaxy S7 I really like the fact that you can now add more memory to the phone It has great picture quality and the battery lasts longer I love the always on feature that allows you to view the date and time without waking up the phone Although I dont particularly like that I cant control my TV with my phone anymore I thoroughly enjoy this phone Great phone The Galaxy S7 is awesome The sleek design the features the speed are just fabulous Camera is A1 This phone is very reliable fast and sleek It is very much like the 5 that I upgraded from which I loved Overall I am very happy with this phone I prepurchased this phone and have had it a couple of weeks now Very pleased with it I like the size features and ease of use I previously owned the S5 and was happy with this but when this latest version came out I knew it was time for me to upgrade Glad I did Nice phone except it keeps losing its charge very fast I got my S7 about a week and a half ago and I am disappointed I am having trouble connecting to WiFi its asking for updates so far I have done 2 battery life is awful I get pop ups for example to do a split screen trouble hearing people when on the phone Nothing what I thought it would be Bought the phone for my wife and she loves it Cant get her off Facebook Shes starting to be more and more tech savvy each day But word to the wise if you are not tech savvy you need to set the phone to only link to the internet with WiFi Be sure you set your plan for your data usage My bride used nearly 56 gigs of hers in 2 hours playing with the phone learning the phone She thought she was on WiFi and was not Just saying be careful until you become tech savvy Phone looks amazing even in a case Camera is one of the best Battery is ok but not up to the level of other phones available Even with just the factory Apps mostly disabled and no personal Apps downloaded the phone drops by 2025 in 12hrs of no use with power saving mode on Battery reaches 15 after about 45hrs of surfing still better than the S6 The S7 would be great if Samsung would do something about its proprietary software TouchWiz and the awful voice command software SVoice SVoice has serious difficulty recognizing contacts and commands especially via Bluetooth and sometimes it freezes so not even the wake up command works The phone also has random reboots and occasional glitches that require a restart to clear Samsung did fix the WiFi issue in a recent update so no more having to turn Bluetooth off to get a stable WiFi After having two S7 phones for the past three weeks I love the looks of the S7 but there are more stable and reliable phones available If Samsung would put as much detail into the software functionality and battery as they do looks they would have the best phones of any manufacturer excellent camera wireless charging design and etc This is by far the best phone Ive had I love the fact that if it falls in drink its works perfectly and reception is a lot better than other phones Ive had and the battery never thinks about not making it through the day The small things I didnt enjoy about my Galaxy S5 have totally been fixed The phone is easy enough for a novice to use but fun for a more experienced techie There is nothing I dont like about this phone It doesnt get nearly as warm as my GS6 and the curved back feels much better in your hand I just got it March 17th so Im still learning all the new differences from my Galaxy S5 I like the background options camera and the multi window option so far I especially love the color gold instead of the black or white phone It ihas a great size to screen ratio Also unlike past phones the super amoled screen is very bright I had to knock a point off performance since marvel contest of champions game runs slowly on the device Overall very satisfied with the phone For the photographers out there this is hands down the best camera out right now on a phone camera is grainy in low light not awesome as everyone describes same as or lower camera quality as S6 lagging qwerty keyboard too having to hit things twice sometimes battery drains quickly while being used lasts very long in standby charges very fast processor is same speed as s6 good phone but no better than an S6 especially not for the extra money it seems as though they refuse to blow you away with top features why would they downgrade from 16mp to 12 they just slightly upgrade one or two things to string you along until the next great release The phone it Greatonly problem I have is I drop calls 1 out of 10 Absolutely love the phone The shape and design of it is very comfortable in my hand The screen and display is incredible Really like how they brought back the best features from the S4 S5 and S6 Having the MicroSD slot is great Im glad they brought back the waterdust resistance Design is great and fits well in my hand Great improvement on the camera with low light Too much bloatware Also touchwiz still needs improving Ive had the phone for a couple weeks now havent had any issues with battery life Love the camera I have plenty of storage space Only issue Ive encountered is that my keyboard will switch away from Swype on occasion and I have to reset the keyboard settings entirely to change it back This is my second Galaxy phone My first was S5 and was very satisfied with the performance speed camera and over features Just upgraded to new S7 and boy this phone is a whole different level 

Just the feel of the phone seems premium and awesome build quality The phones display is amazingly clear and cant rave enough about the camera I take it out of my pocket more than I should just to feel and look at this awesome phone Theres also times when I want to intentionally show the xPhone users at my work how great this phone is comparatively My coworkers have been pleasantly surprised with few actually making a decision to upgrade to Galaxy S7 The new Galaxy VR is another great incentive going for Samsung

Samsung really knocked it out of the park with the new Galaxay S7

Thanks
Allen Changed from a Motorola X Found the transition to be straight forward Samsung support and help have been great This is by far the best phone Ive ever used The battery is insane and its so fast The only thing that lacks for me are they Edge features Although the ones that are useful are neat I wouldnt say that they are worth the extra money as opposed to the normal s7 Maybe Im not utilizing them correctly or theres only so much you can do but either way I was hoping for more That being said that criticism is really more of a suggestion because this phone is still by far the best Ive ever owned The only thing that I dont like is that I can not figure out how to receive group messages For some reason I receive them individually  other than that the phone is great This is the 4th samsung Ive owned and until this one the s3 was the best Id ever used The design on the s7 is very simple and yet very powerful The comfort to me is that the screen icons functional operation and fit are all things that have stayed very much the same over the last 6 years Power and features on the other hand have exceeded my expectations with every new platform since the s2 I actually passed up the s6 because it lacked the expandable memory and a year ago rumors were flying about the s7 with the memory expansion and splash proof design Of course samsung was hush but as we can all see now Im thankful for some of those rumors being true Overall if you liked the s5 s4 s3 etcyour gonna love this one 

The only critic I would have is petty but the lower left multi page button may get in the way of a fast typing texter so be prepared for a 3 second pause to click back on the text screen and resume tapping 

So be confident with your purchase if this phone is on the short list you wont be disappointed Having been a Motorola loyalist for the last 20 years I never considering changing brands until I read about the S7 Edge I had been a bit disappointed in the last 2 phones Droid Turbos I owned and thought this would a perfect time to step out of my phone comfort zone The S7 Edge is nothing short of perfection from the brilliant display to its performance the phone has exceeded my expectations The camera is amazing and eliminates ever having to carry anything else when on vacation Great phone I am very happy with my purchase Fast phone with good storage Great picture quality and fast response System itself is quick with good touch response and menus
Sound quality with calls and music are clear with good levels
The edge apps could use more options with more free and paid apps and more configuration but Im confidant that it will come with time and more adoption of the phone
Always happy and impressed with Samsung Once again another amazing phone Not as big as my Note4 but it is a lot faster This is an awesome phone It is very responsive The camera takes excellent photos Battery life is better than the last 3 phones Ive owned Runs aps flawlessly 
The display is excellent
Id definitely recommend this phone to anyone I bought this phone to replace my S4 because I had to delete most of my apps over time because it regularly and constantly told me it didnt have any more space even though I hadnt added any new apps So far I have been able to install my apps on this phone and still have space The fingerprint scan is very convenient I also love that the phone is water resistant The camera takes nice pictures I like that there is an option to have downloads go to the SD card One of my main complaints is the number of preloaded apps that I dont want Having to disable a lot of useless apps was annoying and some of them still use up space as they cannot be uninstalled Really aggravating I also dont see the advantage of the slightly curved screen as it made finding a screen protector that functions well a challenge and does not seem to enhance performance at all I miss being able to set my voicemail and text notifications to repeat every ten minutes as I cannot carry my phone at all times and don t want to look at my phone constantly to see if I missed a message A removable and replaceable battery would have been nice I hope that future updates do not take up all the storage space I am a true Samsung and Galaxy fan this doesnt disappoint So happy as usual Im beyond happy with the Galaxy S7 I started with an iphone and was feeling a change after 4 years having it so I switched over to Android and got the Galaxy S5 The S5 was a good phone but missed the features of face time on the iphone and maybe after a year and a half later it would freeze up all the time Now with all the video calling face time the camera is AMAZING its water resistant comes with 32gb off bat Iphone 16gb and the gold is so attractive I always show my phone off to friends and family and tell them they should switch over Highly recommend this phone I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and was uneasy because I am very attached to the iPhone features However it took about two days of setting it up the way I like and I found that it has all the features of the iPhone that I like and of coursemore I honestly did not think I would like it I do And Im glad I took the chanceand that was without reading reviews so rather riskyyikes The device is great but has a problem  the problem is you cant take of the battery from the device and that thing is not good if the battery becomes weak  I absolutely love my phone I used Att next to upgrade which made it very affordable Its definitely the best phone Ive ever used From the water resistance to the the edge features Im just in love The best phone Ive ever had BUT there are two downers 1 the design is great but i have big hands and fat fingers so i keep touching the edge which makes it lil frustrating 2 because the design there are no curved tempered glass screen protectors the curve with the phone so you have to use a less protective film protector so mine already cracked from a minor drop off a chair I have had the Samsung S3 S4 Note 3 and Note 4 The S7 definitley has some better apps available and the biggest plus is the phone is all one piece and doesnt have removable pieces The Samsung S7 is an excellent upgrade for my Motorola Maxx It has the latest Android OS and the data transfer was easy I no longer have to wait for Motorola to deliver promised upgrades I think that Samsung support will be better The S7 has worked fine with the call notification but I have not been able to pair it with the text message notification It sucks I can not get service where my S5 did I work from home and people can not hear me on my phone now I stopped in and the put in a new sim card but it still does not work I plan on going in tomorrow in Auburn and go back to my old phone my S5 I can not work like this it is killing my business I am a realtor Im a android lover and Ive owned a s4 and s5 before so upgrading to a s7 I can say Im glad I did Great look feel and features overal Best phone I have ever owned This phone is my best friend I know that sounds pretty pathetic But I am proud to say that my phone this phone is my best friend I dont care what people think It is a really good phone though I have always been a Samsung Galaxy fan I just recently purchased the phone on the day it was released on 31116 I love the size weight look and most of all the camera With that said however Ive had to make numerous calls and visits to an ATT store There is a glitch where I keep getting an encrypted text Daily sometimes more I had the phone replaced however it is still happening I went to the store today and they are going to try to resolve it on there end and get back to me Hopefully this matter gets resolved because overall I am pleased with the phone My phone is awesomei like how you cleaned the displays up as in all Google in one place along with Samsung etc So much more user friendly and a totally great camerasoooooo nice and fastI havent yet used this phone to its potential cant wait to find out keep up the good work Phone was sitting in console of my truck Did not have case for it yet Screen was cracked when console fell on it Wish I had my S6 back Never had a problem with it Do not get S7 Edge if you plan to use it everyday I have owned Every Galaxy except for 2 and 6 The 5 was my favorite but I really like this one especially the 32GB of storage plus expansion I love the design of my new S7 the screen resolution and the picture quality are incredible and dont get me started on the VR I recently just upgraded from the Galaxy s5
The camera is just as great since I just had a newborn the pictures are awsome quality Ithe has a fast processor depending if you are using data The best thing is now I can video chat with family I havent seen They must also have video chat features on their device I hit this phone because I love Samsung products especially the cameras The camera works great processor is fast battery life lasts a long time but I cant hover view my emails get a larger view of my pictures hovering my finger above it before I click on it anymore There are a lot of features that were originally on the s4 and even with that with the software updates they were taken away to The worst thing about this phone is that there is no IR sensor NO TV REMOTE but yet theres a heart rate sensor a barometer and other useless junk that Ill never use The IR sensor and other standard features are what kept me with Samsung instead of an IPhone Bought it a few weeks ago and was excited to see the new features from having a Samsung 4 I love the Samsung pay feature and all the new gadgets that are available with this phone like the oculus viewer There is nothing missing this time Fantastic performance and very pretty Upgraded from an s5 and I love it and Im so happy that the extended storage sd card is back This is best Samsung smartphone ever Very fast screen is brilliant expandable memory is a huge plus I love everything about this phone the sleek shape waterproof and all those things that make Samsung great I love the phone I had the 5 and upgraded to the 7 It is just great I generally like this phone and the camera certainly is better but I am having 3 issues First on the keyboard the emoticon key defaults instead of the microphone and since I use the microphone often this is very annoying Second the period has replaced the comma on the main screen I know I can hold down the period key but again annoying Third there is no touch sensitivity and this is affecting my game play which is very very annoying I came back to Samsung due to the SD card I have A LOT of music so the card is necessary for me Awesome phone upgraded my note 3 and happy I choose this phone Awesome features and loving the gaming app Cool that im playing the game and i can send a text while still playingPlus multi screen runs smooth Upgrading to the S7 from an S5 I notice some major feature changes like speaker and aux port on the bottom Also the power button is lower There are a lot of things that will take some getting used to I do love the sleek feel of the phone Im not in love with the curved screen because I cant find a screen protector that provides the coverage I prefer Im really glad the SD slot is included with the S7 this is one of the main reasons I didnt switch to the S6 I like the frontfacing camera selfie capture feature using the sensor on the back

Overall I am pleased with the phone New toys are always exciting This is a great phone Always been a big fan of the brand Works great and looks it too The Samsung S7 edge is classy light and perfect size It runs smoothly and has great speakers plus a beautiful screen Love that they brought the SD card slot back and waterproof I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 and couldnt be happier the design of this phone is so sleek the camera takes excellent pictures and im loving the game launcher as i play alot of games on my phone the battery life is very good and switching was so easy because of the sd card cant wait for my vr headset to get here so i can have fun with that also being water resistant is awesome too The S7 is by far the best smartphone I have ever used After having to return one that kept rebooting the new Edge is a wonderful speedy smartphone One of the best phones you have ever put out I love it thank you I replaced my 6 with this 7 edge best decision I ever made Everything that is advertised about this has been accurate This phone is the best in a long line of Samsung phones I have owned Camera is great and other features make it the best This phone is one of the best galaxies yet No problems with it Great phone worth excellent features The waterproof design is awesome for underwater pictures in the pool or just the accidental drop of the phone in water that would normally kill the device This phone is the best yet I had the Galaxy S4 before this one and the S7 Edge blows it away I love the edge because it is basically the same size as the Note 5 and I was looking for a bigger phone The edge functions are really convent as it clears up my home page of necessary apps The best part is the Camera I just to a trip to NYC and both the front and back cameras took unbelievable pictures I took over 1200 pictures with my phone and when I show other people they cant believe I took those with a phone I said it before but this is an Amazing phone I have yet to have a single issue with this phone The only thing worth noting is coming from a Note 5 it doesnt seem different aside from the expandable memory Very happy with the features of my new phone I use two emails one for work one for personal and I can easily go from one to the other with this phone Too bad Hillary didnt try it The display is excellent and the optional lighting is great get miraines and its so nice to be able to lower the light I found this phone easy to set up The con would be that it uses so much more data Love my new S7 Very happy that Samsung added back the water resistant and expandable memory features I didnt upgrade from an S5 to S6 because those two features were not included Im also using Samsung Pay which I love It excels at everything I only wish it recorded audio better Its still an excellent smartphone This is the first phone Ive bought before it actually released and I am very pleased with it so far Its performance is unmatched by anything Ive used previously The camera and screen is amazing The clarity and quality is unrivaled by any competitors I am also very happy with the speed and responsiveness of this phone I will definately be sharing my experience with those I know and recommend it very highly when someone asks for my opinion when looking for a good phone to purchase All in all I am so far removed from being disappointed with this phone that buyers remorse is not even a possibility with this purchase Thank you for another great product Samsung I had my phone 2 weeks the screen went out Im not as satisfied as I thought I would be it still has so issues After sticking with the S4 I finally upgraded I love the pics from the improved camera Everything about this phone is amazing It has the best camera of any phone that Ive owned With its new shiny design the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best smartphone in the market The greatly improved camera featuring the lowlight function waterresistant body and the various android applications creates a highly improved experience in using the Galaxy S7 Edge Along with the advanced functions the Galaxy S7 Edge has the best performance in terms of basic specifications It has a very longlasting battery with excellent display and overall very fast performance Also with the virtual reality experience you can get the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is in my opinion the greatest smartphone ever made This galaxy its the best the model pictures ect i will never change to any other type of phone Best Galaxy yet By far the best camera on any phone I ever had Fast reliable cant go wrong with the s7 OK honest opinion from this phone So this phone looks sharp It is comfortable in my hand The battery life is great The camera is awesome in low light situations Now lets look at the draw backs of the edge This phone is slippery Very very slippery You will need a case asap Now I said the camera was awesome in low light but for everyday use i wasnt very impressed Its a good camera but all I heard before the phone came out was how great this camera was The edge is very touchy When holding in one hand it always seems to try and type or save pictures just from how my palm sits You can put it in one handed mode but remember this phone is slippery Over all even with these minor flaws the phone is great So far I am very pleased with every feature of my new S7 edge This is my 4th Galaxy S3 S4 S6 and now S7 I am an avid Samsung Galaxy fan The S7 is by far the BEST smartphone EVER I love how quick the processor is I love getting back the SD card waterproof it takes awesome pictures especially in low light
I absolutely LOVE the FAST wireless charging

The new always on mode with displaying the time and calendar has been great as well I would highly recommend those loyal iPHONE users to give this Samsung android a try You will NEVER go back to the iPHONE Three things I notice right away were
1 When using the self timer it only stays on the camera lens that you are using When I used the timer on my S5 it was on both lens When using the front facing lens with the self timer it stayed only on the front facing lens
2 Quick charge and battery life I love how quick the battery charges and how long it lasts
3 Always on Display I love the option of having the time battery level and date on the front screen I used to have to hit the power button to see what time it was I had a note 2 for almost 4 yrs and every year debated new phones of all kinds I needed a phone to really impress me before giving up a phone that i lovedwell i made the right choice This phone is beautiful and has fully replaced my old phone and tabletlove it Had the phone for a couple weeks now and it has been pretty awesome It just seems to have a glitch where for no apparent reason it is trying to go to split screen mode randomly I am trying to figure out if I am somehow pressing the screen while holding it normally or if it truly is a software bug This phone is the best smartphone I have ever owned Its super fast you can go from on app to another in no time Unbelievable camera And phone is waterproof amazing I preordered this phone before it came out I love this phone and hands down its the best phone Ive ever had Its got a great battery life and love the look and feel of the design Havent used the camera much but the fast processor in the phone is a nice upgrade compared to my prior phone the note 3 Havent tested the water resistance of the phone but thats one of those test Id rather try by accident  The only con is Im still getting use to the not touching the edge of the phone by accident when Im holding it The phone has crisp clean lines that allow the phone to fit comfortably in your hand I love this product Best phone Ive had and I love that its waterproof Decided to go with the upgrade to the Galaxy 7  very nice phone Newer features than the 5S of course but similar enough to learn fast Same screen size as the 5 but slimmer which is nice 

Kind of a drag that you cant get an extra battery since its water resistance but I guess I can live with that It does charge quickly with the correct USB

Con  no glass screen protector yet  just the standard plastic shield protector I would recommend this phone to anyone that is contemplating a new phone Definitely before the overrated iphone Extremely great product The look is amazing The camera is the best out there Very please with the overall design and processing system Very nice features and customization ability Its takes a little getting used to after changing from an iPhone but so far I have not seen any major down falls from changing operating systems I have had no regrets about my change and would do it again Its hard to say anything negative about Samsung when I am such a big fan and own alot of Samsung products This phone is great I love it and would recommend it However the only issue I have is that it does not do what the 5 would do in msgs pic and emails I could simply hover my finger over and it would give me a previewmiss that Have had the phone a few weeks now and absolutely no complaints at this point The processor is very fast no hesitation in any of the apps Picture quality is unbelievable The size is acceptable no issues carrying it in shirt pocket or where ever I can go on about everything I like about it but the best thing to do is try it out yourself The latest version of the flagship Galaxy series is top notch The S7 edge has all the features you could need and the power and performance to accomplish everything you could and want to do Highly recommended plished desing awesome camera long battery live micro sd storage and waterresistant that what i wanted most it has everything that i wanted in the phone This phone is great Very fast and the amoled display is beautiful Battery is great Lasts a while even with heavy usage All around great phone and would recommend this to all my friends I went from the S4 to this and I am glad I did Battery is great and charges fast using apps it does draw more but talking and texting it is very good Photos are great I expanded the SD card to 64GB so the phone now has like 90GB Video calling is cool but only those who have it and it does use your data Overall it is a great phone Love Androids Love it Love the water resistance best of all And no more stupid little cover over the the charging portal fabulous idea I do not like the price of any of the smart phones however But if you must pay this is the one to go for The camera is crisp and clear Memory is awesome there is just not enough good things to say You wont be sorry if you buy it I like the S7 edge for sleek design and easy use on phone Love this phone Easy to use lots of features and its just the right size for a phone Going from an S5 to the 7 is a huge difference I love how much user friendly the 7 is Battery life alone lasts longer which is a benefit when you have to be on your phone all day

One of the best things so far is that I can hear people when I am on a call and they can hear me clearly without having to plug in my ear buds Will stay charged longer than my old S6 just wish it had the IR remote I think this is the best phone i ever had looks nice and feels great And it has great features Seems to have a problem when trying to turn off Has happened at least twice Other than that  my 5s was great  the s7 goes beyond that Great product I have had the S4 S5 Note 4 and now the S7 Edge This is my favorite so far even though I am still learning about all the awesome things it does I recently have backed away from software and hardware products by other companies as they sort of trap you into their lair So my Galaxy s7 and recently acquired Galaxy Tab d2 is part of a personal effort to survive in the digital world with Android

Have had a few smartphones over the past several years but am most happy with my Galaxy s7 The screen on this device is beautiful processor is snappy and software plus thirdparty applications can do just about anything I need it to do Having two windows open simultaneously is quite helpful at times Battery life has been very good too

If I had one niggle it would be that the screen is super sensitive Without a case I was constantly launching apps by accident when holding the phone on the edges I recommend that everyone install a case to minimize or eliminate accidental launching of apps Had for a few weeks battery life is good camera is better than the s5 which was my previous phone This phone is fantastic I have been a very avid iPhone user over the past several years This phone has let me enjoy using Android again I like the phone and all it has to offer really like the themes and the AOD characters that are on there Picture is way better than the s5 Not really happy about the battery life With it not having a convention battery like the other ones it steers toward the iPhone which I was trying to stay away from and the reason I like my android So far the Galaxy S7 Edge has been a great phone The screen is excellent battery life has been better than I expected and all apps have run well WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity have been problem free and call quality has been good

The only drawback is the lack of removable battery While the battery is more than sufficient for a typical days use the phone must be returned for repair if the battery goes bad I have been using Samsung Galaxy phones since the S3 and have yet to find any other android phone to compare Even though Ive been using these phones for a while Im still blown away by the new S7 
First of all I love the color choices I decided on Gold Platinum and I feel like a superstar using it
I also cant believe how fast this phone is I have been using it constantlyadding new apps left and right and it still hasnt slowed down The features are great because I can easily take a photo and capture an entire memory instead of a single frame Taking a picture is so easy too because I just press the home button twice and BAM Photo Action I can also listen to music and watch videos with amazingly bright display and crisp speakers I feel like this phone is more durable and lightweight and provides ease of mind with my clumsy fingers

The best part of this phone Its not too expensive I found myself on a plan buying this phone for a reasonable price

I love this phone Kudos to the creators and potential customers BUY IT ALREADY  I love everything about my new galaxy 7 The photos I have taken are top notch I cant wait to take it on vacation The phone works great The response time is very fast Can go between apps quickly and smoothly The Battery life is great Left phone uncharged for 36 hours and still had 38 battery left attractive easy to use packed with features and reliable I love the camera I was very happy with the camera in my 5 but the ability to do more with lowlight is a big big improvement for me The battery life is better than I expected too Honestly I dont have a single complaint about this phone Its truly a state of the art phone with all the bells and whistles you could want but its a bit fumbly to use The volume down button is opposite the power button Every time you wake it up you also lower the volume

Its nearly impossible to pick up or remove from your pocket without pushing one or more controls hardware or software button

The screen is gorgeous typing is amazing although its predictions and Swype completions are almost never correct for me

Im coming back to Android after using Windows phones for several years and Android  even this latest version  seems pretty clunky to me with lots of nonintuitive features But the Google Play store is a treasure and Samsung Pay is wonderful Got this phone for my wife and she is not very hip to the game as far as new phones go but it was an easy transition and she loves it This is my first Samsung phone I have been an a different brand of phone supporter for years This phone is OK I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 and it is a huge step up in regards to build quality camera quality screen quality and features It does have some bloatware but nothing compared to what came with the S5 The feel of the S7 in your hand seems like a solidly built phone and not flimsy plastic I love the camera now It has a quick auto focus and a lot better low light capabilities The screen is crystal clear and sharp I love the wireless charging First time I made a call with this phone was to my wife and she was amazed by the difference between this phone and my old one She said it was crystal clear and it was like I was right next to her talking compared to my old S5

We will be definitely upgrading my wife to an S7 as soon as possible I am loving the S7 The screen is beautiful every app works fast Love all the features from one handed operation to split screen Multi tasking is EASY Camera takes amazing pictures Hesitated upgrading from the S5 since I loved that phone too but so glad I made the leap You wont be disappointed I have been using it for about three weeks and I am very impressed with the phone The camera is way better than the turboCall quality is very good GPS navigation is great I really like it better than the turbo I had Got the s7 the day it released and couldnt be happier unless they made it with a removable battery But having SD slot back was big for me Overall I am very happy with this phone
The fact that I cant get it connected to my WiFi is aggravating and I have contacted technical support and it is a known issue 
Once that gets fixed I will be happy 
The camera is great
The speed of everything is great
No complains except for the wifi Im in love with the camera shoot great photos and high quality videos This phone has been nothing but great This is my 4th Samsung and by far the best one Ive had yet Overall the quality of the phone is excellent Its very easy to use fast and take quality pictures I like the versatility of the phones storage features The only thing I done like is how slippery the phone is Even though it is much higher more durable that previous models I find that I drop it a lot more than other phones With the exception of the loss of the IR blaster this is the best android phone I have owned The look and feel the reduced TouchWiz the great camera are all excellent features My s4 lasted four years before I decided to upgrade because all the subsequent ones have not had everything that I wanted This phone is fantastic I kept saying I would wait until the Note 6 or the comparable Note to the Samsung Galaxy Edge 7 After having this phone for 2 weeks I am very impressed the only thing that I miss is the stylus pen that went with the note but I didnt use it as much The performance of this phone is very great it moves fast even with the several Verizon updates Ive had so far I have had the same number of apps as my Note did and it still runs way better and faster nothing has compared so far to this phone it is great I enjoy the wifimobile calling feature also Even the features on the edge screen works great I use them all the time for quick access like just desktop shortcuts on a computer After roughly three weeks of using my new S7 Edge I must admit that Im thoroughly impressed Not only is the screen aesthetically pleading physically the colors vibrantly pop from Netflix to Clash of Clans

The VR seems a bit gimmicky for now but it demonstrates potential As for the camera it does a great job and Im certainly impressed The colors are solid even when I share the photo with my wife who has a non Android phone

Happy I purchased this phone I only really have two minor gripes with the phone to this point The first is that it can sometimes be a little too sensitive and opens links when I am merely scrolling through The other is the placement of the speaker on the bottom right The way I hold my phone especially when playing games three fingers behind cradling on my pinky blocks the speaker and I cannot hear the sound

Big picture those are very small issues and this phone is an excellent step up from my previous phone HTC One M8 Ive had several older Galaxy S phones the original Galaxy S1 S2 and the S4  my wife had the S3  now the Galaxy Note 4 I have to say I really like the S7 the best 

Im very happy theyve decided to add back the Micro SD slot on this phone I think that was the 1 major drawback on the S6s While a non removeable battery for many may seem like a draw back to some But think about it last few generations of phones how many battery issues have you had As in defective battery Ive had none 

The only real issue is battery life which so far this phone does amazing with Now a days too there are those battery charger packs you can get Heck I got once with this phone for free and have yet to use it

The features of the phone are pretty awesome and their seems to be less bloatware then past models Yes there are still a few some stupid NFL thing which got immediately disabled and a couple others I love the VR Gear option with this phone and the VR Gear goggles are pretty sweet much cooler then I had original thought I had as did my wife thought was more of a gimmick And maybe to some degree it is marketing wise But the VR thing is actually pretty sweet My wife is not one to easily impress especially with video game like things She ended up being on the VR Gear for over an hour the first night we got it just playing around with free apps and such while I got maybe about 25 mins on it

Also there is a theme option with this phone and I really like it wasnt to thrilled with the bright menu options so being able to find a night dark option was great

The camera is really great and a lot better then my S4 and the low light feature really works much better then I thought it would

Normal phone usage phone calls texts etc All work pretty great the clarity of the calls is really good and the additional increase sound option I love because Im partially deaf 

The speaker of the phone is at the bottom which Im finding to be a much better decision then on the back in past models especially when watching videos and the like I was always finding myself cupping my hand to drag the sound forward toward me which isnt very comfortable Now with the speaking at the bottom of the device when holding the phone sideways though even right way the sound is nice and loud and I dont need to cup to be able to hear it even in busy areas like I did in the past

The screen is just amazingly crisp and clear and videos games VR  normal look great on it

The phone is pretty darn fast  responsive using programs games apps etc No hangs or anything Ive noticed as of yet

Over all I think this is probably the best phone available now and is definitely the best Galaxy S model to date I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone And Id definitely encourage anyone with an iPhone to switch over this phone is a ton better then any iPhone Oh and the water proof thing is pretty cool as well

My only 2 real complaints are First I miss the voice control of the alarm nothing like just being able to lay in bed and yell at your alarm to stop and it does just that though I always wished I could say shut up and it would stoplol 

Second this is more of an android thing I think then anything on Samsungs side but I really wish you could move all apps you install on the phone to the SD card some apps give you the option afterward but not all and I would like them to just always install there to begin with I love my new Samsung it is so user friendly andIamenjoying it daily It can do so many things and performsas expect Would recommend it to anyone I have always liked samsung products andwill continue to purchase them in the future for family and myself Great phone no need for a seperate camera this one is great Ive owned almost every smart phone out right now and this is the best Camera and battery life are amazing The phone works amazing The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is wonderful Lightweight Great light I am glad I got the new galaxy 7 it to me is one of samsungs best phone yet I love this phone Its artfully beautiful to look at and it works like a dream I used to have a Galaxy s5 from US Cellular And while I loved the phone I really hated the service My mom has been with Verizon for years and hasnt had too many problems with them So I decided to switch to Verizon after they released the Galaxy s7 It has the features of the s6 that I loved only better designed And it has expandable memory which was the main reason I didnt upgrade to the s6 when it came out I like to have a lot of music on my phones and take a lotsave a lot of pictures And sometimes the internal storage isnt enough for that So bringing back this feature made me very happy Not to mention its a gorgeous phone Samsungs have always been some of my favorite phones Never had any problems with them This phone has a BEAUTIFUL display good battery life amazing features and cosmetics to the phoneloving my gold platinum and it has an AMAZING camera Takes beautiful shots and video The auto focus and blurring of the background has to be my favorite about the camera I am not disappointed at all with this phone or my service Thanks Verizon I had a Samsung s4 for four years And loved it I was worried about upgrading because that phone had treated me well but so far the s7 has been amazing The screen resolution is amazing As well as the durability I love the storage space One thing that is a little iffy is the Camera Its great but sometimes makes things a little soft around the edges I love the new device Was expecting more from battery but other than th at has great functionality Being my first Android I did not expect to like it as much as I do I love the speed display and aesthetics of the new S7 Edge The issue that some may have is with the edge If you are hard on your phone this may not be the best phone for you I have yet to find a screen protector that stays on the edge Maybe one day they will make it but Im thinking 95 of the cases will still roll it up due to the design The cases also dont truly protect the entire screen how could they That being said it is one of the best phones I have owned I purchased it over the s7 because of the screen size and battery size Im happy with it and would buy it again So far so good 
But there are lot of features that have impressed 
The edge handle feature is very handy and useful I like to swipe through quickly and get to my apps quicker 
It is amazingly fast and gets the job done
But as of now there were a lot of glitches on this phone Multiple occasions like the builtin speakers will have this feedback or somewhat distorted sound But after a reset it will go away 
The finger print screen lock sometimes useful but other times very frustrating It seems like you have to place the whole surface of your finger to make it actually work 
The other thing I experienced yesterday was the power button didnt turn off So I panicked thankfully people were experiencing the same problem as well so a hard reset it was back to normal 
I know this is a new phone and I figure there are going to be patches along the way But I feel like this already too many problems for its new launch I may be nit picky but a product with the many appealing promotional deals and etc It should at least fill its name I love it dont get me wrong but was a little slightly disappointed by the outcome of new glitches It has everything my s6 edge plus had plus a lot moreits amazing so far We picked up our phones on the 12th and things were going well until my phones screen went black I tried to find a solution on the Verizon website but the website is next to useless I finally resorted to driving up to our nearest Verizon store and the young lady got the phone working again She had to simulate removing the battery because you cant physically remove the battery on these phones I installed an update today and Im hoping that may cure the screen issue I cant stop telling all who I come in contact with about the new s7 I have iPhone friends who are jealous and dont even speak to me The edge panel is great and the new Google set up is crazy I love this phone Product is great but still has some cheap plastic component like sim tray Which should have like iPhone I really love this phoneI had all the Samsung phones and this one is the bestit works great with really great features I love that it is waterproof and has a sd slot again You will be happy you bought this phone Love the form factor of this phone I have the S7 and it still seems to have very slightly curved edges Its hard to describe the effect but it really makes the phone feel good in your hands Being water proof ahem resistant is amazing I used to hate getting rained on only because it was risky for the expensive little computer in my pocket No more worries about that The Gear VR is amazing and fun to show friends Overall love this phone Battery life is also outstanding and charging to full take around an hour and a half or so Power is never an issue The ease of use as an android user is appreciated however if someone is not used to the OS then it might be a little more taxing on the set up process The OS is very smooth and easy to maneuver through The camera is a significant upgrade as well If Samsung would not put so much stuff stored on the phone that took up memory it also be a significant improvement Battery life is off the chart Adding the memory again is great Lightning fast Best phone till now Awesome performance and have had no issues so far I love the phone I have gone through many smart phones ranging from iPhones Androids to some pretty bad dumbsmart phones The S7 had all of the essential key aspects that you look for in a phone today It can do everything that you need it to do quickly and easily I have been so extremely happy since purchasing this new phone I purchased the phone less than a month ago It luckly failed before the 14 day grace period and we were able to return it The side buttons quit working and over the course of 2 days the phone quit all together We replaced the phone with another new one 3 days ago It is failing as well The side power button is intermittent and the phone can take a call about 20 of the time Very odd but I would not recommend this phone at this time until they get the bugs worked out The phone features are easy and camera quality is awesome The battery lasts for the entire day Not much of a learning curve from S3 Fast charging Upgraded from Samsung S4 mini Loved that phone and this is better Easy to upgrade and all info backed up to phone seamlessly Very fast processor and long battery life Some items need to be relearned but would recommend this phone Ive had the S7 for a couple weeks now and everything has worked great I upgraded from the S4 which i had for over 2 years and was still working fine but I wanted the S7 for the new faster camera and a longer lasting battery

Pros
Camera speed is super fast and crisp and by double tapping the main button it opens immediatelygreat feature
The fastcharging feature is amazing my phone is usually fully charged before I can fall asleep at night
battery life  I use my phone frequently and have yet to go below 50 after a full day of use
Removeable SD storage is back so you can increase your phones capacity

Cons
Size  I would have liked for the S7 to be the same size as the S7 edge I wasnt sold on the edge feature and worried id end up with a cracked screen I really like the S7 I had an S5 before and liked all of the features it offered The S7 pretty much continues with everything that my S5 had and so much more I bought this phone a few weeks ago and love it Was easy to transfer things from even my old iPhone onto here plus the expanded memory It works smoothly and I love the camera highly recommend this phone only thing I would like is for it to have the removable battery again bUT thats not that big of a deal upgraded form a galaxy S3 and find they have made many great improvements Phone restarts when listening to Iheart Radio very annoying I would have kept my S5 if it had not broken My family all have iPhones but Im an Android lover Decided to try a Galaxy and now wish that I had been getting one from the beginning I absolutely love my new phone The camera is great the sleek designeverything about the phone is awesome coming from a galaxy 4 mini the screen size is an improvement The battery life good improve I have had the phone less than a month and the batter needs charge about every 12 hours The drawback to the phone is the no replaceable battery Picture quality is great as is the volume SmartLock doesnt work at all No hands free options function  NONE Wifi disconnects Mystery texts get sent without any record Contacts arent discoverable  meaning when you ask the phone to message a contact they cant find that person No easy way to mute the phone Calls abruptly disco go mute and then lock up the phone forcing a hard shut down Camera zoom doesnt work half the time Cannot emphasize enough how much I hate this phone Ive had the phone for 11 days after my S6 went on the fritz Since day one the tortoise like speed of processor is extremely disappointing While the aesthetic of a Samsung product is never disappointing I was hoping for the speed and battery life revered by iPhone users alike I cant help but feel let down Bluetooth and network issues are a daily battle and Ive been able to narrow it down to a hardwaresoftware issue This may be the first time Ive been disappointed in my new Samsung I almost wish I didnt upgrade I like the phone but sometimes I run into problems Sometimes my words with friends app doesnt act properly and sometimes the phone doesnt make a sound with a phone call or text I purchased this phone from Costco Phone Ctn and it is the best cell phone I ever owned So far I loved it Has enough memory with extra for everything I have on my phone The battery is better than the S5 The camera is better love that Much faster I am very happy with the expanded storage A little disappointed that we have to use a different charger from the Samsung Galaxy S5 I love that it is waterproof Especially since my 3 yrs old is very sneaky and fast He has already taken it to the bath tub 3 times I do everything with my phone from personal use to work etc So I am enjoying it very much The design is a lot more sleek but its hard to use parts of the screen if you get one of those glass screen protectors They dont cover the screen completely and if you put it in an otter box defender case its even harder to use The battery life could last longer right now I get maybe 18 hrs out of it and I am a light user My old phone would last about 2 days I thought about getting a new Apple phone but I am glad I didnt since they dont offer expanded memory slots Plus the Galaxy phones are a lot easier to use Best galaxy so far Have own the original galaxy s the s4 and now the s7 All great phones They have their moments over load of memory and battery consumption but overall with a larger sd and rechargeable case just makes owning a galaxy that much more worth it So far so good I havent had any problems My calls are crystal clear photos are excellent it is fast and has been holding a charge pretty well I love the functionality of the phone I just wish it was a little bigger I love this phone call works good it really do live up to its name I left android phones years ago because they were getting terrible I went to an iPhone 4 and loved it Recently my iPhone 5S broke and I decided to check out the Samsung phones I decided to get the new S7 and am blown away Its smoother faster and takes better pictures than my iPhones did The technology blows iPhones away I wont go back to Apple Better than my last phone Droid Maxx but nothing too special Ive had mine about two weeks and missing my Samsung 4 Only thing I like is the finger print unlock and that doesnt work if your hands are damp or sweaty Sound quality over the speaker for hands free talk is poor It doesnt have voice answer like my Samsung 4 and I cannot uses hands free to send text The key board on text makes us switch to symbols to get numbers unlike the 4 which had number in both sections The keys are smaller so with a mans bigger fingers it is harder to use The Samsung S7 is far superior to my previous phone Sound quality touch control available apps etc are all much better The quality of this phone exceeds any other phone Ive had There are many more features included or that can be added The battery life is much longer easier to use and the camera is fantastic I love it The phone is definitely an upgrade from the 5 The only bad is the keyboard texting writing emails and general use the keyboard seems to act like an iPhone the outside keys do not seem to respond to accurate screen to finger positionsa lot of miss letters and other navigation problems I bought the GS7 a week or 2 ago and it is a truly awesome phone Everything is faster simple to use and did I say FAST Great camera improvements including rapid shooting resolution video etc External storage port is heaven to have again

Now the BUMMER This phone does not see any of my bluetooth headsets at all I am an avid podcast user while running and hiking My Old Galaxy S4 saw each of my 3 bluetooth headsets each from different manufacturers and all relatively new but the GS7 doesnt I have scoured the web for a solution tried everything even remotely related to posted GS7 BT problems but no luck I am so bummed and can only hope it gets fixed in an update Its like having half my phone Otherwise fantastic phone If they fix the obvious bluetooth problem I would rate this phone 5 stars easily I love the Galaxy phones and will only EVER buy them This is a great product  ease of use smooth transition speed sleek design The camera pictures are amazing Always impressive Just purchased it and Im glad I did I love the creativity and craftsmanship of the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge The look of the phone alone is very appalling The features are easy to use and or modify as needed I got this phone a month ago and love it This is the first Samsung phone I have owned after buying Motorolas for the last 8 years I have had this phone for almost a month and while I like a lot of the Samsung functions after normal use during the day checking social media several times and taking a few pictures and several phone conversations my battery is typically at 40 by 5pm Im not sure if this is standard for this manufacturer or not I verified that it is mostly the OS that is using up the battery not apps I do really like the removable storage so I can have all my music on that rather than the phone Phone has a great camera and much better battery life The one big issue has been the wifi drop that reverts to mobile data even while at home with a strong wifi signal Recent patch update but will have to see if that does it I have had this phone for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it Its fast the battery time lasts and the camera and other features are amazing I upgraded from an S4 about 3 weeks ago and have had no problems Great phone takes awesome pictures Swapped my Iphone 6s for the S7 For the most part I have been happy I did not like that they took away the find my phone option Like the return of the memory expansion Big plus that it allows me to voice text through my jeep I have had it for a month and I love it avid galaxy fanhad them all and this by far is the best Fantastic camera and sound quality is perfect Luv it Phone is extremely nice and have not had any trouble with it works great I finally decided to upgrade from having a Galaxy S3 to the new S7 This phone has awesome features including pretty good battery life assuming you install a 3rd party app killer  manage your apps accordingly an EXCELLENT camera  beautiful display good call quality more functional voice controls an ultra power saving mode which comes in handy when battery life is getting low external storage up to a 200 gig micro SD card  water resistance

On the down side Ive noticed that the screen sometimes doesnt initially respond when you attempt to select something  as a result you have to tap it twice I noticed this prior to adding a tempered glass screen protector The finger print reader usually registers but will fail almost all the time if your finger is even the slightest bit wet Ive also noticed that certain email apps fail to deliver push notifications mainly the Yahoo mail app  after trying quite a few things including clearing the phones cache  clearing the cache on the app the only way Ive gotten it to work again before it decides to fail again is to completely uninstall it  then install it again

Over all Ive very pleased with this latest Samsung phone  Im very glad to have purchased it Coming from the S5 I see significant improvements better displaycamera quality faster lighter better looking and just overall an improvement I skipped over the S6 because the two things I loved about the S5 were absent on the S6 but the S7 makes up for that by incorporating the expandable storage and water resistance and considering it already starts as 32gb my additional 32gb card is more than enough storage  I didnt have a sd card in my S5 until the begining of this year Overall its just a good phone it does get warm to the touch when charging sometimes but thus far I dont have any negatives to say about the phone other than no tempered glass screen protectors yet that account for the curve of the phone non edge model but those should be rolling out early April so nearly there Set up was easy customization easier as theres a theme option unsure if thats on the S6 but its a cool feature for sure and unexpected as I love to modcustomize my phones I dont like that you have removed the same health lock screen step counter offer the s7 And that weather widget 45 is not on here Went from Galaxy S4 to S7 Phone is great works perfectly No complaints No problems so far Battery isnt any better than the S5 i had before I was hoping for better battery life Nice phone went from S4 mini to the S7 What a difference the camera is great the fast charging is convenient Did not take long to set it up to my liking So for so good Very happy with my new Samsung galaxy S7 After some early aggravation regarding wifi and Bluetooth which they fixed with recent update I am completely satisfied with the phone Good speed and excellent pictures Ive had my Galaxy S7 for a few weeks and I am so glad I made the switch to Samsung This phone was so easy to set up and transfer all my apps etc The battery lasts for almost 2 days with just regular use It lasts 1 day if Im playing lots of games I havent tested the water resistantance but Ive handled it with damp hands answered the phone while doing dishes and it worked I bought this phone in February and received it a couple of weeks ago It is a very good phone I love it It is a lot better then my old samsung galaxy 5 Would highly recommend it I jumped from the S5 to the S7 and it has been a great decision I delayed getting a new phone since the S6 did not have the SD memory option but new that the new style was what i was looking to get The S7 has great speed battery life and clearcrisp display I love using it Excellent features and very easy to use The VR is amazing and all of the apps work very well Highly recommend This is for my first upgrade to a new new phone and I have to say I LOVE THE NEW SAMSUNG S7 It is super easy to use and the features and apps are great My battery last for hours and the wireless charger is super fast I just love it its a great addition to the Galaxy S family After two weeks of using this great phone the screen went black The phone was still on but the screen stayed off I checked the Verizon website and found a soft reboot procedure which started the phone again with the screen working as usual Other than that negative incident I would say that this is the best Samsung Galaxy that I have owned The features are intuitive the screen is clear and has GREAT definition the camera has worked flawlessly and the touch screen is amazing When other people ask to see my phone the most often compliments are how great the screen definition is how light the phone is and how the screen responds to touch Not happy with the bluetoothwifi issues Takes a long time to send emails I have had this phone for about 2 weeks I love it I upgraded from the S4 so there are a lot of changes with this phone A lot better camera with better picture quality and cool features I LOVE that I can unlock the phone just with my thumb print in 1 second no more entering a password Only improvement would be to have an even longer battery life but considering that I had to charge my s4 3x a day and I only have to charge this 1x a day it is an improvement Although I loved my Galaxy S5 Im very glad I got the Galaxy S7 Nothing to complain about with this one I needed to upgrade my Samsung Galaxy S4 antique so when it started having issues with the keyboard I knew it was time I heard such great things about the S7 so I knew I would be getting a great product I was like a kid at Christmas waiting for the arrival of my new phone It was also a breeze to transfer all the data from my S4 to my S7 using the cloud service I have only had the new phone for about 2 weeks now and it is already so much better There are so many improved features and I have only had it for a short time so I am certain I will love it more the longer I have it My Samsung Galaxy S4 was a great product and I was very happy with it In fact the only reason I did an upgrade was because it started to have serious issues However I am happy it did as I truly LOVE my new Galaxy S7 I cannot say enough about this product I am a new user to Samsung I am coming from an iPhone Very easy to use and learn Set up was very easy Picture quality and resolution is amazing Seems like battery drains fairly quickly though it moves pretty fast and I like the metal case and wireless charging option The notifications on the OS leave something to be desired the persistance of trying to ad my data to a cloud when I keep saying no is annoying I love this phone its fast and great Also what you hear about the phone being water proof is true and it resists scratches The only downfall is their is no remote control on this model but if that doesnt bother you then its a great phone If it wasnt for the Gear VR AND the 32GB device memory I would not have purchased it Every new phone has different locations for the same feature settings I got my S7 the day it came out trading in my S3 which I loved There are definitely pros and cons
Pros Fast great camera that has no delay graphics are top notch cool options love the fast charge battery
Cons Defaults to black screen without warning and has to be restarted Gallery freezes and has to be restarted Auto restarts sometimes without warning

Not sure if I have a defective model or if this is just to be expected Ive had this phone for a week now and overall its been fantastic Quick smooth great features has all of the Samsung ecosystem apps and its a great size My only real problem is battery life I tend to use it up in about a long day However with the adaptive fast charging this is MUCH less of a problem than it would be otherwise We just upgraded from a dumb phone last week We cant believe the clarity and functionality of this new phone I also have a iPhone 5 provided by my work I love this S7 better than the iPhone 5 I just made my purchase of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I could not be happier It is very easy to use fast and looks great with all kinds of great features So I bought my s 7 phone about 2 weeks ago love the phone takes great pictures its so fast overall one of the best phones at a Samsungs ever made So luckily I was notified that my phone was waterproof because at work I was painting over a truck hoist the pit below it is about 13 feet down The hole is about 1 and a half foot X 3 foot long as I started to paint the end of it my phone fell out of my pocket down the pit into the mud water Greece and oil needless to say I freaked out started moving as fast as I could to get it out knew I had a little while being waterproof but not oil proof took me about 10 minutes and I was able to retrieve it half a dozen guys around me yes I brought it up I could see the notification light flashing made me smile took my greasy phone over to the sink wiped everything off took a little blow gun gently blew earpiece cleaned up to look like new again made a few phone calls tried everything out and it works as well as I thought it would thank you Samsung  This is the best Galaxy yet The performance and design make it a perfect phone Battery life is weak My older Moto Turbo was just as good Dont get me wrong its nice its just not what you would think of for a flagship phone I love the phone but did have a problem last night I was texting and all of a sudden the screen went black I could not get the phone to work or restart I had to go on to the Internet and found out how to restart by holding the right button and the down volume at the same time The person at the Verizon store should have told me about this possibly happening Upgrading from a S5 Active on a different carrier to the S7 was amazing I love the wireless charging which even works with a Speck candyshell case Ive had this for about a week now So far the learning curve has been smooth from the change over from a Droid Mini I love all the new features the Galaxy has and the camera is the best part I went from a Galaxy S4 to an S7 with Verizons new upgrade program I really like how I upgraded my phone went into the new plan and reduced my phone bill without paying a huge upfront cost for the phone Very nice for consumers and makes me want to stay with Verizon

I love the S7 Super smooth The camera is by far most noticeably improved from the S4 Clean images and ability to edit

Operating system allows for quick app startup and processing Buttons have quicker response time

The ONLY reason I didnt give this 5 stars is because of the removable battery The S7 is solid state unmovable battery This is a problem whenif the phone freezes Also in the event someone would want to carry a backup battery for long trips I moved from an LGG2 to the Galaxy S7 The G2 was getting tired and needed to be replaced Verizon made it easy for me to get the latest and greatest Galaxy I love a lot of features of the phone so far pretty happy I wish the keyboard was more sensitive and reponsive it frequently kicks me off wifi and often have to restart the phone Also this is more of an app issue but certain apps dont work well and then some work perfect one day and not the next I love the camera wireless charging overall phone just hoping some of the phone and app issues get worked out soon I upgraded from an S4 to the new S7 The camera is amazing and is my favorite feature I kept reading reviews before buying and heard about the awesome battery but I havent been too impressed with the lifespan I have to turn off the power saving mode so my Pandora will play which kills my battery And i usually firget to turn it back on lol Sometimes the person on the other line cant hear me well and my audio while listening to music crackles Like any phone it has bugs and Im sure Samsung is still working to make this phone the best there is In the end Im happy with my upgrade and look forward to learning new tips and tricks Upgraded from S5 so is very similar but runs much faster Not completely satisfied with the battery life no better than the S5 but had higher expectations after reading reviews  too bad it cant be replaced like the S5 battery There are a few quirks that havent been resolved but it may be the upgrade to the OS thats the problem rather than the phone wont display text  email previews in notification bar Has more memory plus has expandable via SD card so I now have space but would have been nice if it was offered in 64 Camera is better than the S5  clarity and takes pics faster I got this phone to upgrade my Galaxy S5 and specifically avoided upgrading to the S6 The water and dustproof are fantastic durability features that should be default in most phones now The addition of the expandable storage sold me on this phone My one issue is the software specifically all of the added apps that cannot be uninstalled While this is only a small issue it is something I wish all carriers and manufacturers would address I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a new phone whether this is their first smartphone android phone or mobile device Getting a tight fitting case is simply required to avoid dropping the slippery glass phone I almost got the S6 but am glad I waited Great battery rapid charge they brought back removable storage waterproof Camera is awesome and the display rocks Only drawback is non removable battery I have had my phone for just over 2 weeks and absolutely love it After a brief 3 day hiccup due to my own ineptness I am up and running again I love the ease of use and the ability to customize settings and screens to reflect my unique lifestyle and personality One suggestion would be to add more zen like tones to the sound options  Great phone but when calling anytging that requires touch tone options it refuses to work right I upgraded to the S7 from an S5 The phone is really nice and has a lot of great features and a wonderful camera BUT VERY Disappointed that there is no longer a Screen Rotation on the phone Some apps can be rotated but many cannot Hope you consider bringing that option back on your next generation This phone is over the top over the edge and over any expectations I love this phone however since the new update my wifi doesnt work and I end up having to use my data instead of my home wifi Please fix its my only complaint I purchased this the week it came out Absolutely love it Bought it from Costco and they set it up for me and have had no issues Camera is excellent Everything is working great Battery life isnt as great as advertised but quick charge works fast 7 is awesome really got this one right Much better than any of the iCrap products Super elegant and a pleasure to deal with The best Android device Ive ever used Amazing camera the bloatwares are almost gone runs smoothly and the battery longs almost two days

Ergonomy is fine premium finishing the device is just gorgeous Dont worry about Samsung Android version the customizations are now limited to a minimum and really helpful features

Ive also bought a 64GB miniSD card so now I can store up to 96 GB of files

So far so good I like the phone However I wouldnt have upgraded from my S4 if Verizon hadnt forced Lollypop on me It degraded my S4 to a feature phone I dont see much improvement over the S4 except more memory and possibly longer battery life Anything else is incremental at best Brought the Galaxy S7 shortly after launch These replaced our aging HTC DNAs
This was as you might expect a huge leap Speed and quality are amazing In our location the signal strength is nearly zero We had a network extender for our old phones THe network extender is listed as not compatible with the S7s but appears to work Check with Verizon if you have an old network extender to make sure

Overall the S7s have lived up to our expectations and will keep us on the Verizon network I like it it is very fast video and sound quality are excellent Not a 5 due to battery life but at the same time no less than 4 because battery recharges super fast Received this phone by ordering it thru Verizon on the web First day it started randomly restarting Everytime it restarts it wipes out all the personal settings
It has continued to do that for the last week and nothing fixes it

Remains to be seen if a new phone is all it takes From my limited research appears this is a common problem

I would discourage anyone from getting this phone until Samsung fixes this issue unless you like redoing your settings and having your phone randomly rebooting This is a beautiful phone otherwise Had a Galaxy 4 Would not purchase the 5 or 6 due to features This phone has everything back that I was looking for Only missing feature I would have liked to see is the 30 USB charging port I would trade not replaceable battery for a water sealed phone any day Especially one that has great battery life like the new S7 does Great job with the minor adjustments of the screens and the camera features I am still discovering some of the new features but I love this phone Best phone I have ever had Like everything about it I had a GS4 for 3 years because it was rock solid and I loved it This phone is just as good only better and faster I spent a little time personalizing and its all mine Thank you Samsung for doing it again with the GS7 This phone is everything that was great about the S5 AND it has an even better water rating than the S5 and rekindles our love with expandable storage Just be careful when you pull out the SIMcard holder to place your microSD that lil sucker of a SIM will shoot across the room lol Its also everything great about the S6 with none of its faultslike the lack of water resistance slippery in hand etc Its slicker sexier sits well in the hand and has higher QUALITY camera and a higher grade of Gorilla Glass than the S6 Side note Mega pixels are not and SHOULD NOT ever be used as a marker for quality of camera If you dont get this or how aperture and shutter speed effect your photos you dont get photography and should sit down before you hurt yourself

Overall I love this phone I was hesitant to buy but am loving it The fast charge makes it easy to stay fully charged Does everything the reviews said large SD card is awsome If you are worried about the size dont be Fits comfortably in my hand and slips right into your pocket During normal use I dont use my phone for games the battery life is outstanding Could go a couple days without recharging Cant wait to get the Gear VR to see how cool it is Love the phone Easy use This is my second Samsung coming from an S5 super happy with the performancebattery and camera great job it has some quirks that take awhile to get used to  the screen is either overtly sensitive or non responsive i give it a solid meh This phone is new and I love it
This is an upgrade for me from a Samsung Galaxy s5 to the s7 and the features are remarkable The camera upgrade is amazing I am disappointed about several things
1 Samsungs attempt at Swype is often very goofy on simple words
2 I liked the ability to adjust text size with the volume button on my S4 which is not available on the S7
3 The screen goes crazy sometimes for no apparent reason going in and out of multitask mode repeatedly
4 The speakers seem to be better than my S4
5 The camera seems to snap a picture quicker than the S4
6 Battery life is much better than my S4 I love the camera I love the design I love my Galaxy S7 I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The graphics are great The new features this phone is amazing I am able to do so much more with it The shortcuts are great as well Cant wait to learn more about this phone The process is so quick I can work between apps and it responds quickly The screen is larger and the phone excels Its a great phone for work I can multitask easily I have owned every galaxy starting from the Samsung Vibrant and all the galaxy S series I have to say that this is by far the best It is very quick and has great features I will never leave Samsung as long as they keep making phones like this Overall this phone is awesome I havent had any major problems with it Its fast its pretty its durable I am very satisfied 

The picture quality is great for taking pictures of everyone else I have taken some of the most beautiful photos with this phone The selfie mode has a little bit of a fisheye quality to it so it basically makes my chest look bigger or whatever is at the edge of the screen Probably great for other people not a feature I was looking for Maybe theres a way to change that feature that I havent figured out yet

Love that you can check your pulse SpO2 and stress level Other than the sym card problem with texting and the power button going out the first week its a great phone Such a great phone I havent had any issues with the phone at all Other than power button not working on the first one and the sym card problem with the text messages I love the phone Its easy to navigate and the apps are easy to find and use The display and camera quality are the best I love the edge pannels It feels very high end and is extremely comfortable to hold I have used Samsung products for quite some time now From television sets to microwave ovens from Smart phones to Smart watches I have yet to be disappointed This is quite the upgrade from my outdated S5 that I got just under 2 years ago The processor is much quicker and user interface is more friendly Have been and will continue to be a fan of Samsung with such focused attention to their products Keep up the good work The S7 is Samsungs best phone yet and arguably the best phone out there The build quality and feel are excellent This is not just a fast and great featured phone but a piece of fine jewelry as well The upgraded camera is great and the ease of use and customization available from the software are what youd expect from a highend Samsung product I have been in love with every Samsung Ive ever owned I have both the note 5 and S7 great devices Camera is AMAZING I think that the product is awesome the S7 Edge delivers it all from style to performance However I would have seriously debated another phone based on the fact that the bootloader is locked

I think for the money spent that I should have the option to do what I wish to my phone including rooting it Therefore I can not recommend this product to my family  friends 

I will most likely sell the phone and purchase one that I can customize to my needs  liking


Thank you
Dissatisfied consumer I upgraded to the S7 Edge from my Note 4 and Im glad I did There are pros and cons to the switch but I love the feel the look and the speed of my S7 Edge I thought I would miss not having a removable battery but I dont Im glad the SD card slot is back because the camera makes me want to take more pictures I dont like the speakers though the sound isnt as powerful as it could be even with it turned all the way up but I have Bluetooth speakers which do help I love the fact that its water resistant so Im not stressing about my phone getting wet Thats awesome The price was a big jump from my Note 4 but if you want the best it comes with a price and I believe I got the best This the best galaxy s phone hands down it took the best of pervious two phone s6 and s5 combine them together for a awesome phone I switched from an iPhone 6 and then a Galaxy S6 Edge  and love the S7 Edge model It is a great size without being too big the camera is amazing display is beautiful water resistance is comforting expandable memory is reassuring and operation is smooth I am also very excited about the coming VR option and generally excited about the operation of the system overall

Love the phone Ive had my s7 edge for some while now Its great The battery lasts longer than my s5 The display is just too good It handles all my email whereas the s5 didnt It has wireless charging capacity I had to buy a special back for my s5 All around its a great phone O and the calls never drop and sound great Nonreplaceable battery but not an issue Upgraded to this phone and have not had an issue yet I really enjoy it I love this phone not only is it cutting edge with the edge buy it also has all the features that I am used to having with owning a Samsung Its a great phone with lots of battery life and takes amazing quality photos and video I love my phone It has a nice feel to it Very good quality it performs so far fast and easy The new features make perfect cense and work flawlessly I have owned nearly every Galaxy device Samsung has to offer and as far as the phones go the Galaxy S7 Edge is my favorite device It has tons of features that didnt exist prior and the features that were carried over were improved upon The only downside so far is that with the device being so new there is only a limited number of accessories available but as time goes on that will increase  The pluses of the phone are to many to list as every aspect has been improved on or it is a feature that Samsung has already perfected in previous devices I highly recommend I love the features that come with this phone Everyone I talk to and show the phone to are amazed at the look and speed of this phone The one thing people praise the most is the quality and speed of the camera One comment I have heard many times is wow that is better then real life The pic quality is phenominal The little apps added for people who like to use their phone for games is really nice The ease of taking screen pics and sharing is just what an active gamer needs And you have to love the speed of the phone for handling all the game apps and things active people do without slowing down it is very nice to have You tie all that in to a wonderful battery that will last even with intense phone use and a fast charger that can take a phone from 5to 80 in a matter of minutes is really hard to beat I am a very satisfied customer This phone has everything I need and does just about any thing you can imagine Its a over all the best phone out This phone is like no other other phone out there It is sleek and feels amazing in the hands It looks feels and preforms like a professional device The only down side at the moment is the battery life Yes it last hours and hours on end but it seems to die too fast at times Almost as if there is a system running in the background that always turns off and on The battery will last longer at times then it does in others Its strange but other than that this is the best phone ever by far Amazing job Samsung Thank you for all the amazing products In my opinion this phone has great features design and style it has everything you would want for a phone and more I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 So far this phone is faster The themes are good and the always on is good I expected better battery life than my s5 The s7 battery is as or worse than the s5 Had the phone for 2 weeks now Excellent battery life beautiful screen good performance My only 2 issues thus far are
1 not being able to use the SD card as adaptable internal storage
2 the ATT bloatware

Otherwise a great phone Love the design of this phone extremely elegant The features are extremely neat however I wish some apps werent already installed and I was able to delete them Only issue is the static noise that appears when I play music in my car Compared to my old reliable Galaxy S5 this thing is absolutely amazing Everything about this phone is so much better Performance looks display overall look and feel camera everything This device has a level of performance Id always hoped for in a smart phone The S6 didnt really catch my attention The return of the memory card slot and the water resistance two of my favorite features on the S5  sold me on the S7 I received it on March 10 and have never looked back A bit expensive but expected for a device of this caliber

This is a fantastic device Thank you Samsung For anyone looking to upgrade from a former galaxy product this is it Some things that were a bit annoying to do have been streamlined All the things that I do now are easy moved from Iphone and i am finding the Galaxy so much more user freindly I love this phone i wish it was bigger phone I enjoy having a bigger phoneand this one feels like a baby phone but i still love everything it can do I love my galaxy so 7 edge and I cant wait to get my virtual headset This is an expensive phone and you would expect that it would work properly but it doesnt
I have had the S7 for 2 weeks It will not in most cases  load pages IE Google GMail Face Book anything that requires datawifi
Hopefully I was one of the unfortunate that just received a bad phone as I did like my galaxy 4
I am returning to Verizon with it The S7 is definitely a high end phone It feels nice to hold and performance is good The camera takes great pictures and the software is good too I wish it had some of the motion gestures the droid turbo 2 has as well as the ability to really perform some actions without touching the phone voice activated One other aspect I would improve on is how much it heats up it gets way too hot after recording video for a couple of minutes I replaced my HTC M7 with the Galaxy S7 and could not be more pleased After setting up the new phone I feel like I had it all along The speed camera and over all feel of the phone exceeded my expectations I was hesitant about the micro sd card feature but it worked from the start and the setup was easy This is a great phone the picture quality is nice and I love that it is waterproof Samsung products are the best Absolutely love the display and the camera definition I have the GS7 Edge This is my 3rd Galaxy series phone Storage camera interface battery life screen water proofall has improved The best phone on the market Period When its time to upgrade from my old Note 3 Ive been comparing the iPhone and Samsung phones When this S7 Edge came out the design really caught my attention Not just that but also the features like longer battery life wireless charging etc So far Im loving my new phone The way Samsung improving their product I think Im gonna stay loyal with them from now on This is now the third Samsung Galaxy phone I have had and it is the best I do wish there was a removable battery but that wasnt a deal breaker for me This phone lives up to the specs The processer makes a huge difference The phone has a nice camera with quick response time on shutter speed The pictures at night are really nice This is a big difference compared to my note 3 There are times when I press the screen and nothing happens I have to wait about 15 to 20 seconds and the it responds I have tried everything to stop this but to no avail I even restored the phone as new Just crossed over from the I you know what phone and cant believe I waited so long
This phone is like having my laptop in my pocket Absolutely love it So I upgraded from my S4 to the S7 a little over 2 weeks ago and I love it This phone is quick and easy to use but I wish I can keep Samsung pay even if I root it I recently upgraded from a galaxy 5 which I loved This phone is everything the 5 was plus much more Love the bright colors and better than 1080 quality for watching Netflix Plus lots of space for music and photos And love how fast the processor is Great sound quality also I would definitely recommend it to a friend All around a fantastic beautifully designed phone Slight issue with overheating but everything else about this phone is way over expectations I was on the last day of my trial period and had just called VZ support for assistance as I was having issues along with quite a few other S7 owners I was about ready to try and return my phone for another and then a system update went through and has totally changed my perspective on keeping this phone I had been turning off my data to give the WiFi connection a chance I left it off after this update and tried out a few games I had previously been having issues with and they worked without any delays at all Im so very happy this issue has been taken care of as this was the only real issue I was running intonow about this battery lifemaybe with this update it will help the battery last just a bit longer as well Love the Phone Best Galaxy phone to date Great battery lfebeautiful design that rivals IPhone and responsive with the new Marshmallow Os I am loving it Was debating going back to IPhone but not now Samsung has a winner This phone finally has all the features that I like in a phone Aside from being a functional phone with texting capabilities this phone runs android so smooth too You can link shortcuts to the home page and the settings allow you to turn on or off so many more features My only gripe with the phone isnt even due to the phone itself but with Google Its the Google play app I dont care for it but there are hundreds waiting to take its place on Google app store The S7 allows me to load all my apps at one time It is fast Feels nice in my hand  is easy to use Like all the features Glad I upgraded from the S5 waterproof widecurvytrendy screen bright colors awesome camera performance boost everything is way ahead than the best of the best phone in play today Samsung reached a level only it can beat in future But battery performance is a let down it doesnt hold up to its promise Drains almost as fast my earlier S6 Edge did Marshmallow is another nonimprovement as far as I am concerned May be its the Verizons custom Marshmallow release thats causing me trouble but some of my most used apps dont perform well at all
Otherwise S7 Edge is a great phone to have in your hand Literally unlimited storage capacity Way to go Samsung The quality is wonderful Its sleek design is almost unbeatable It is definitely just a smaller version of the most high tech tablet ever the only difference is that it is obviously smaller Plus I love that it has a thumb scanner and it truly is water resistant along with the watch that it comes with I work in a restaurant and all of the waiters and waitresses have to help with the dishes so my hands and arms are constantly getting wet The watch still works perfectly fine along with my phone I can finally text in the shower Plus the camera is amazing The only thing I dont like about it is that the battery definitely does not last as long as they say 4 words Beautiful crisp snappy amazing Overall the total package The S7 Edge is by far the best phone Ive ever had Very speedy phone with a similar but new interface I just dont like the glass back My note 5 was in a case the whole time and the glass back cracked from a tiny pebble getting between the case and the phone Im amazed at the speed performance sleek styling Best phone ever Samsung has proven once more they are superior I love the clarity  the newer features that the S5 did not have I like the stylish design on the s7 The camera takes awesome pictures I did have a little disappointment on the phone The power button was not working at all and had to restore phone hoping that it would fix the problem and it did Works great now I love my Samsung phone Ive had the s5 active and Iphone and this by far is the easiest to use The best feature is the night time clock feature I like being able to look at the clock without lighting up the whole room This phone is so much faster than my previous Samsung s4 The apps are a lot easier to keep track of with the apps together with the product I switched from an iPhone 6S Plus Rose Gold 64gb edition to the Galaxy S7 Edge 32GB Gold edition and so far I have loved it I love the edge display and the rear facing camera I would say that I have very few complaints about this device It gets warm it gets with medium usage and the battery life are my main 2 While this device has s 3600 battery I feel that my iPhone 6S Plus used the OS to make the battery life on the iPhone better but not by much maybe an hour or 2 depending on my usage I also love Samsung Pay I have used it every where I possibly can and I think its wonderful however I needs to add Capital One to the list

The display is beautiful I love looking at photos on my S7 Edge because the colors just POP And taking pictures is even better The low light camera is one of the best Ive ever used personally coming from iPhones and a Note 5 a few months ago

I think my other complaint is the processor in the USA model verses the International model After watching some videos online and after seeing tests performed the International model is the better one of the 2 to have It seems to be faster runs cooler and can handle multitasking a lot better then the Snapdragon processor in the USA model I would love to see the International model available more here in the USA as a standard instead of International

The last problem I have with this device and this issue is more because of ATT and thats all the ATTDirecTV bloatware that is preinstalled on this device There is so much that takes up space and it cannot be removed unless the device is rooted which I dont want to do but I hate the fact that I cannot remove these apps Especially the DirecTV ones I dont have DirecTV and never will so I find it very useless to me 

Fix these minor issues and this device would be perfect for me I would rate 5 out of 5 if these minor issues were resolved I love this phone It charges up so much quicker than my last phone has a great camera and sound And I love the goldplatinum color Im very happy with my new Galaxy S7 There is nothing about this phone that I dont just love The display is so crisp and clear the ease of use is amazing The camera is phenomenal I cannot believe the quality of pictures that I can take I honestly think I get better pics than I do with my DSLR camera The onscreen editing tools are greatand I love the capability to easily share pictures with friends and family The clarity when talking on the phone is so much better than any of the other smartphones I have had Overall I love all of my Samsung products and convinced my mother to use only Samsung as well due to the ease of use and quality of the products Just picked up a new S7 about 5 days ago Its awsome but the case is a little slippery I think it need a protection case The firmware is super Updates are easy to learn So I upgraded from a Note 3 and let me tell you it was so worth the wait I have not been able to put this phone down What drew me to this phone was the edge screen The Silver Titanium color is gorgeous The picture on the website doesnt do it justice I cant be mad at the fact they brought back expandable storage please dont take that feature away again Oh and lets not forget water resistance Thank goodness they upped the battery life because I have been spending some quality time with this beauty and it lasts a long time The camera is amazing the game launcher is a cool feature the edge functionI didnt think I would use it but I have and its very useful The fingerprint scanner is one of my faves I can add extra security to my phone financial mobile pay apps or if I want to hide content only way it can be accessed is with my fingerprint Im pretty happy with my purchase Now Im waiting for my free VR Love Samsung galaxys Has lots of cool features Sleek design I loved my S5 and and Ive been looking forward to this phone I love the look of it the screen is beautiful the camera is GREAT It has so many edit features I havent even used yet It took me a little bit of searching to figure out how to set up my home screen the way I wanted but once I did I love it I love the Samsung Apps I was happy with most of the features of my previous phone which was a Samsung Galaxy S5 When the S6 came out it lacked the water resistance SD card slot and removable battery there was no way I was going with that Samsung brought back the SD card capability along with the water resistance and dust proof but not the removable battery in the S7 I hope the battery will not be an issue in the future My son gave me a Samsung Gear Fit for Christmas that I love so upgrading to the S7 was my only option I am glad I did My car radio has Android Auto and my S5 never synced correctly only emails and none of my contact phone numbers showed on the radios screen My new S7 connected and works great with Android Auto showing my contacts with phone numbers The S7 has the time showing when the phone is locked This doesnt seem to be a major battery drain and its a nice feature It is 11 in the evening and my phones battery is at 48 I find the finger reader works better than the S5 as well Overall I am glad I got this phone The detail in the screen is amazing love the camera options Very user friendly love this Samsung 7edge I really like the large screen for picture viewing I chose the edge over the note because of the expandable memory Ill start with the drawbacks Im not sure what you were thinking about the glass back It sounds nice but we know how it turns out Weve all seen it for years with iPhones And the fingerprints people only like those when they unlock stuff Wouldnt mind a metal back

TouchWizits definitely come a long way I hope it stays as smooth as it has since day one on this phone but thatll take a bit more time to tell You have the brains there to make TouchWiz as smooth as the glass on this wonderful phone Now get it done or throw your keyboard on top of stock Android and maybe the themes as well I like them

The bottom speaker if you could turn the home button into a fingerprint reading IP68 HD speaker I would probably not only be a life long customer but invest in stock as well

Cant wait for a more efficient battery

The great Improved edge panel camera screen SD card slot ergonomics oh how Im a fan of your keyboard did I mention the camera the cooling tube IP68 and pretty much every other feature that I cant think of right now The power management is great Even with the AOD I can make it through the day at work with one bar of 4G at best no WiFi at all Dont ever take away the SD Card slot or the water resistance I love my music without having to stream it I already paid for my music once Amazing phone and like the water resistant feature Just wondering when I will receive the free goggles that comes with my purchase My trusty old Galaxy S4 was starting to be a pocket warmer since it was overheating a every few days so I felt the need to upgrade The water resistant and dust proofing ratings played a big factor in my decision to stay in the Galaxy line with the S7 I am not heavy into fitness but do spend a great deal of time outdoors while geocaching and walking so being in dusty environments or getting caught in the rain is not uncommon The RAM and storage memory ensure that every app I want to download will run fast I loved my Galaxy S4 but I love my new Galaxy S7 even much more Really like this new phone  Nice upgrade from a galaxy 5  A lot more memory  Water resistant is better than the 5  Im clumsy so this is definitely the perfect phone for me  In my opinion this is the best product Samsung has put on the market No other device on the market can compare Compared to the Galaxy 6 the Galaxy 7 is more intuitive I could not be happier the S7 is the best cell phone Ive owned  Ive owned plenty The transition from the IPhone is easy Great built in features  programs great apps wonderful screen The people at the Samsung Store in Best Buy were awesome knowledgeable and did not rush me Overall a pleasant purchase Was only disappointed in color options as I loved the white Still learning all the new features but I love the performance and speed I strayed from Samsung with my last phone and I am so glad that I am back with one of the best cell phones on the market You cannot beat the lightening speed of the apps the crystal clarity of the display or the dependability and reliability of a Samsung product Hands down Samsung products beat any of their competitors with their quality and topnotch technology Whether you are gamer an avid photographer or simply a basic phone user you will not be disappointed with a Samsung product I simply love it Im gonna be able to do more with this phone than I ever thought possible I love this phone and always showing it off Its screen is perfect for watching videos and movies I had the Samsung 4 prior this phone and what a difference the camera takes amazing pictures and people can hear me really clear
Love my phone This product is one of my favorites I had the samsung s6 and did not like it at all The battery was way to small I think i had to charge it a few times a day Glad they upgraded that The water resistant is amazing the SD card is great as well The speed in the s7 is noticeably faster then the s7 The picture quality and the features of the camera are great The only thing that i was sadden about was that peel feature I had my s6 programed to my tv and wad dependent on it But its definetly not a deal breaker Love what they have done with the s7 cant wait for the next to come I know they next is gonna be a million times better then the iphone will ever be Samsung has won me over with this device Expandable memore returned and a beautiful design Samsung pay is awesome and honestly was a big reason I switched from iphone I upgraded to the s7 from the s5 I liked not only the price but fabulous new screen operating system and of course the cameraI have never taken such low light pictures with a phone like this oneIt rivals the performance of my high end DSLR I own and would recommend this phone to everyone The other reason I love this phone is the ip68 rating it getsIm always around water and tons of dust everyday which isnt great for anything but this phone can handle itBy the way its worth getting the wireless recharging pad I love the fact that wireless charging came with 
 phone Minor updates equal a huge improvement Fast thin light everything most people want in a phone Comfortable to hold different yet familiar phone in the Galaxy family I upgraded from an S4 to the S7 Edge by the preorder program and have had the device for 19 days I am still learning the features First impressions are improved battery life and the Marshmallow operating system is a plus The quad HD display is very sharp but not significantly clearer than the S4 With the added 64 gig micro SD card I have sufficient memory The water resistant feature gives peace of mind The fast charger is probably 30 faster than the S4 The phone seems easy to hold on to even without a protective case The slim design and rounded edges are attractive I am pleased with the performance but I still have not utilized all that the S7 Edge has to offer I am not a power user so have not challenged the device I have 2 concerns I was told at preorder that the 64 gig micro SD card would be utilized as additional App memory along with the 32 gig already on board When the phone arrived I was told that that was not the case due to a last minute change I am disappointed that there is only 32 gig of standard memory in the US when other countries have 64 and 128 available I would have gladly paid for more standard storage My second concern is the wraparound display of the Edge It is difficult to handle the phone without encroaching on the display and triggering software interruptions This is especially annoying when using my Kindle App Even though the display is larger than the S4 it is not noticeable In the end it was time for an upgrade and the S7 Edge is the latest technology I would recommend this phone
 I was happy with my galaxy 5but the speed of the 7 and features are incredible
I would like to see the boil late programs be a choice so a must carry
I never liked that feature of forced to have on any product
I wont use them out of spite
The phone is fabulous and I would strongly recommend it I had the S5 and didnt by the S6 because I wanted waterproof and the ability to add an SD card I was happy to see they put that back in the S7 Im not a great photographer and did not expect to see a significant improvement in my photos but the S7 camera is impressive Very quick focus and no more delay to snap the pictures Colors are crisp The phone is beautiful and exceeded my expectations in battery I am a heavy user of apps The battery keeps me going all day I absolutely love this phone I always had an iPhone so I had a little trepidation going to the S7 edge Not anymore I love this thing It fills pretty comfortable in my hand It looks great takes great pics connects very fast able to get all the apps I need and some No regrets at all going to an S7 edge from the an IPhone This is the best one so far What a display I waited and they brought back being able to use the SD card Thank you Samsung There are so many neat little things I feel like Im still finding things I love theedge and use it a lot and the battery is unbelievable I just keep playing I got the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge the day after it came out I was a little timid because I had the Samsung Galaxy S5 I can say that when I first turned it on the screen resolution was amazing If you have never had the edge design it may a little intimidating at first but I caught on real fast I love the feel of the phone because it is so smooth and light getting a case for it as soon as possible is highly recommended I love to download music on my phone and I must say that when I started to listen to my music the speakers and sound quality kinda blew me away for a phone I also go to a lot of concerts and events so taking pictures is a must The quality of the pictures is amazing I LOVE that there is flash on the front facing camera because at concerts it is dark and this phone takes beautiful pictures If you are looking to upgrade get a new Samsung or a new I HIGHLY recommend the Samsung S7 EDGE I cant express my love enough for the Galaxy S7 Edge

Without a doubt my favorite phone Ive ever had the pleasure of using Its lightningquick flawlessly designed is comfortable to hold and is WATER RESISTANT

You just cant beat that Over all great phone clear picture videos loud speaker love it Hi my name is stacie belding and I am a Samsung lover I am always have to get the new Samsung item that out I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 5  And I upgraded to the new Samsung s7 edge  I love the phone  Ithe has a great size screen and great features I do wish I was able to have the side bar that the note 4 edge has But other then that it great I was satisfied with my Galaxy 3 and patiently waited for the right time to upgrade The Galaxy S7 fits the bill Nice upgrade cool features and sleek design I upgraded from S5  this phone is the best Awesome phone Well engineered Faster sleeker and better Reminds me of a bigger faster and sturdier Galaxy 4 so overall its not a bad phone I would recommend it to a friend just nothing totally new to me The Samsung Galaxy S7 is very light weight and the gold platinum finish makes the phone look very expensive The features make it easier to switch apps from one page to another Some the features I experienced with the S4 are on the S7 so it made it an easier transition The new feature and equipment to transfer data from one phone to another is very helpful The categorization of setting features are easier to locate the feature you need to set up the phone The multiple choices for the applications grid size themes and wallpapers Finally the feature to transition between screens and to close all of the screens at one time is a time saver especially when I am able to simultaneously talk on the phone Im in love with my Samsung s7 Edge The display and the quality of the camera are amazing Having to carry this item in my pocket all day is easy with it being lightweight I LOVE IT The camera quality is beyond that of any other phone And the features are better than every other phone Great speed and Im glad they brought back the memory card slot Everything works perfect I love its design and feature Also this phone has an excellent camera Between the incredible camera overall durability and my favorite EXPANDABLE MEMORYthe s7 is without doubt the best phone on the market I have several samsung products including gear 2 watch 60 inch smart tv wireless charging pad and my new car has one as well I love the integrated platforms and user friendly tools I would recommend this product to everyone and anyonein fact my mother just purchased a new s7 and my girlfriend is going this weekend to get one as well I been a loyal samsung customer since I got the S3 Just love it Samsung just gets better and better with their innovative products I owned the S5 since it first came out and I am thrilled to have the S7 now The newest features are amazing and the software is so user friendly I absolutely love my S7 I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 its fast and reliable I love that the microsd card slot is back and the processor is water cooled Unless you use fast charging and play on your phone for the most part it stays cool The only thing I I have a problem with is the disappearance of the built in remote control which I love because I misplace my remote or someone has it with them and you dont want to get up the phone remote is great Lastly I dont have any issues with the S7 except that I would like to see the remote added Great performance Good battery life Love the wireless charging and that is very water resistant I have had this phone for about three weeks now and I love it The screen is the perfect size and it is so clear I love all the themes you can use to personalize it and make it your own I have not had any issues with all the apps I use and I use a lot I had a Galaxy s5 before I got this one and I liked that phone but I love everything you can do on the edge I was afraid the battery would run dead really fast but it lasts me all day so that is a huge relief Lastly the best thing about this phone is the camerait has the best one I have ever seen so clear and bright I joined Instagram just so I could show off the awesome pics it takes Get this phone because it does not disappoint There are several features that come from my cell phone provider that I dont like but overall there are very few things about the phone itself that I would change Having had an older model galaxy I have a couple of things that are different on this model that I would have preferred to have back I liked the scrolling screen rather than having to go back and forth left to right This goes for the apps pages as well I have found it very hard to move apps from one page to another though I really like the folder options they come in handy and I like that this folder does not have to be repeated throughout the device I can have some of the same icons on the front pages in separate different folders When a choice for phone my 1 future is batterie because is worKless have a nice phone with batterie dead second memorie why make a phone with great Camara o take 4k video with no a lot memory that why a love this device plus bonus the look and more definitely is one of the best device available in wish Samsung keep make device like this thank I love this phone easy to use best camera and design is sexy Love that they brought back the water resistance feature with no flap Phone is fast and easy to make my own I will start this review by saying the Samsung s7 edge is my awesome new play thing Ive never had an android device before this one so Im still learning how to use all the features The visual experience is amazing with this device so watching movies and viewing photos on this phone is extremely worth the upgrade The most appealing feature of the phone is definitely the sleek appearance but the definition of the screen is a close second I also love the fact that the memory on this phone is expandable 32 GB would never be enough for me otherwise This phone is waterproof which is what pushed me over the edge when deciding whether I would give up my iPhone or not I cant tell you how many times I lost a phone to liquid This is the most amazing phone I have ever owned I would highly recommend it to anyone I know Love my new device love Samsung products phones tvsDVD player all great I love features and consistency of Samsung but I am having issues with the wifi and Bluetooth I have enjoyed my phone and the battery life is awesome on it I love everything about this phone from the excellent picture video recording to the personal settings customization Its unlike any other phone Ive ever had If you dont have one Buy one I finally found a phone that can do everything I couldnt be happier that I upgraded to the S7 I love the fact that I can store my pictures on an SD card and not have to download themusic so often It is very similar to my last galaxy phone the s5 which is awesome because I dont have to relearn another device The overall design of the phone is sleek stylish and comfortable on the hands The performance of the phone is top notch Whether connected to WiFi or not speed is extremely fast I just upgraded from a galaxy s5 to this so my standards of a phone are pretty high and this phone blows away all expectations of a cell phone I always buy samsung products and Im usually satisfied I had the Samsung galaxy s 4 and waited patiently for my upgrade to get the galaxy 7 So far I have had issues with the curve on the screen no screen protector fits properly and dirt and dust get under it Also my screen has turned completely black on 2 occasions Luckily I found something online explaining how to reset without prying my phone apart trying to get to the battery Then today my screen went completely haywire and I couldnt get it to turn off and reset for about 30 min It was continuously accessing random apps and pages rapidly I dont feel like a phone I just purchased should be acting up like this already I really want to stay with Samsung so I hope this issue is resolved And I experience better products Maybe its just the phone I received Highly recommend The only thing I wished was a little better was the battery life my G2 must drain it but I think I can make some adjustments to make it better The Samsung S7 has been a huge improvement over all of the other cell phones I have used before The quick response of the phone to both touch and opening apps is very impressive I have not noticed any lag or slowing while having the dual screen mode open or playing any of my cell phone games
I am a huge fan of having a high powered digital camera in a cell phone This phones camera is very responsive and so very crisp I have played around with the Pro Mode I love that I can have more control over everything from the multiple auto focus aperture settings and the ISO levels
The finger print reader was a little bit for me to work out and get to scan my finger But after a few tries it works flawlessly
Overall I say this is a GREAT cell phone Phone is fast and works great I have had several other Galaxy phones and every model newer always seem to impress Highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new phone Wont disappoint I love this phone There is no other way to say it I was disappointed there was no replaceable battery but the extra long life makes up for it I just dont have a lot of bad things to say The interface is superb and the speed of the phone is great It is just overall a great streamlined version of the last few Galaxy phones I thought I couldnt love a phone more than my Note 4but I was wrong Better screen faster processor much better battery life and much better camera All this and a really aesthetically beautiful device While it is quite large it feels smaller in the hand with just the right amount of heft while still pleasingly thin The fast wireless charging and the water resistance just take it over the top Just really love this phone Big reason I wanted to upgrade was due to the cameras inability on the S6 to focus in lighting extremes either bright lights or low light conditions this new model is focusing spot on now I received the Galaxy 7 Edge phone a few weeks ago and so far it has been the best phone I have ever used I am an IT Consultant so I am very picky about my tech gear All features of this phone seem to be well balanced while the phone itself looks very upscale smooth and stylish This phone is water resistant according to specs which is always a plus whether the threat is rain or a 3 year old that wants to stir my coffee with my phone it happens The open USB port is waterproof so there is no annoying USB rubber flap to break off I love the curved screen and curved back that are both encased in the latest Gorilla Glass which makes this a comfortable phone to hold and improves the phones overall look in my opinion It has a fast processor and all of my apps run very quickly yet it generally stays very cool when running apps The AMOLED screen is absolutely beautiful with excellent color contrast and it has a tremendous resolution of 2560 x 1440 The camera is very good the battery life is good reception is very good and it will accept my 200GB flash memory card for tons of photos video and media The fingerprint scanner works very well and you can program it for multiple fingerprints This is much nicer than having to enter codes and patterns in every time I have mine set to lock every time I hit the power button for security reasons The only thing that I missed was having a hard button to turn on the light at night when I needed it but there is a power button flashlight app available that gave me back that functionality I am very happy with this wonderfully designed cell phone   I also have tried out the Gear VR headset with this phone and it is absolutely amazing if you are interested in trying out the virtual reality capabilities of this phone when used with the Gear VR headset Its got it all ok whats not to like about this phone its beautiful to look at and that screen is the best I was surprised how easy it was to set up I was dreading having to move everything over from my last Samsung 4 to the new 7 the new adapter was so easy my only issue is when you put the sd card from the old phone into the new one it asks do you want to format the disc it should warn you if you do it wipes the card clean I lost 1 years worth of pics so not happy about that hard lesson learned getting all the apps and home screen set up was also very easy the battery life in the new 7 was a much needed change the sd card and chip tray also a great feature The only other negative I have is the price ouch but I bit the bullet anyway Im enjoying my new G7 It really is a great phone Im still learning something new about it everyday Im glad I waited for it VERY GOOD PHONE COMES WITH LOTS OF GOOD FEATURES Honestly the best dam phone ever The only problem I have which doesnt matter if you have a case the edges are really sensitive without a case But everything else is awesome My S7 is amazing Touchwiz is seamless and offers multiple toggles to turn features on snd off allowimg you to customize it how you want it to work This is THE BEST phone I have ever had I am a solid Samsung advocate because of this phone The black is silky and rich looking The phone is all style and grace It has a premium look and feel The software is smooth andthe processor is lightning fast I am in love with this phone and tell all my friends about it virtues and value Samsung got it right with this phone Thanks for returning the sd card and water resistant rating I cant say enough praise for this phone Want a great phone This is it So Ive chosen this phone due to its water resistant feature With this being said Im a pretty active person and having a water resistant phone sounded like a great idea seeing as I do a lot of fishing What Ive found is that for such a sporty feature this device is not sporty AT ALL For some odd reason they decided to make this phone with a glass back Within a week I have managed to Crack the glass on the back of the phone taking away its water resistant feature I previously had the S5 which was exactly what I was looking for being such an active person This phone is NOT worth the money All in all I believe this to be a major design Flaw and completely takes away anything I was looking for in a Samsung device Going from the Note 4 to the S7 Edge caused a little trepidation with going to a smaller size I was also giving up the stylus The Edge is everything I look for in a phone My transition was seamless I Enjoy the features and am still learning the ins and outs Looked o reward to learn I Nguyen and using even more of the features I really like the Edge screen and the edges The phone is just cool and lives up to its advertisement Simply amazing
Holds battery life fast charge as well
Waterproof
Very lightweight Iphone who IPHONE WHO Samsung is taking over the world The fastest galaxy Ive owned yet and I had 4 of the 5 last phones S6edge Note 4 S5 S4 Great device and easy to use Camera is amazing Battery lasts with heavy use all day The Samsung 7 is loaded with excellent features such as the SD card slot water resistance and an awesome battery life with fast charging  I upgraded from the S4 and really am overly impressed to say the least love the fact that I can glance at time without turning on the screen Great phone I really like how they have improved on the ability to move data to and from the SD card Gear VR looks cool Just cant wait till they have more apps for it This phone is so awesome fast light weight and fun 
Epic masterpiece from Samsung The versatility convenience functionality and performance of the Galaxy S7 Edge is unbelievably superior to every other phone I have ever used This includes other Android brands and other operating systems The Edge design is the most convenient phone feature ever and I cant imagine not having a phone with this convenience The battery life is incredible The display is crisp and detailed and the colors are vibrant beyond description The size is perfect and it fits like a tailored suit Its design performance and reliability are far ahead of the current state of the art technology and will be an extension of me for years to come Samsung set a new standard for smartphones with this device that others will be striving to achieve for several years to come I have always been an avid Samsung fan with my Tablets and phones but several years ago I switched phones because I wanted a more premium experience Once the S7 came out I went to my local store and put the phone in my hand and I was completely astounded by the premium feel and features There is no phone on the market I have seen that compares Samsung has proven themselves the best with the S7 and I am looking forward to their next flagship phonetabletelectronics as I am positive it will be the new best product on the market The s7 certainly is the top rung of the ladder and competitors should be weary I was apprehensive at first about upgrading but man Im sure glad I did This phone is super fast and responsive It feels like a brand new computer in the palm of your hands The camera is better than any camera on a cell phone Ive ever used I am beyond satisfied and would recommend this phone to everyone I have gone back and forth between Android and iOS phones for years now My first requirement is an ability to make a call This may seem like an odd thing to mention however I live in an area with spotty coverage from all carriers  so it is a concern With the S7 I now have a hard time finding a spot where I dont have coverage and I am very pleased

There is that and the rest of the package  softwarehardware  feels more refined than previous version and the S7 is pretty snappy when it comes to performance as well

Overall I am finding the S7 a pleasure to use the migration from old to new phone was painless and I have zero buyers remorse i had the s6 edge and didnt like that I couldnt put in a photo memory card the s7 edge has that feature and has a great battery now last a lot longer between charging over all I am very happy with this smart phone So far the phone has worked flawlessly The only issues I have are concerning the lack of auto play when it comes to movies or TV shows I am playing from my video folder The issue is that once the current episode finishes the next one doesnt begin automatically Also the lack of the carousel scrolling like I had on my galaxy note 4 is missed but not a deal breaker The only other issue I have had is that when I am sending a text message and swipe down to see my notification screen the keyboard doesnt go behind the notification panel it stays up front Overall I love the look and the feel and the speed of the phone and would highly recommend this product or any galaxy product to my friends and family Samsung does it again makes the best phone even better  Love it seamless transition from my S5

Love it Truly a remarkable piece of technology Absolutely love it I am very happy overall with my new S7 Edge I am still finding new things I can do with it but the Edge features like the apps edge and people edge let me get quick access to the apps and people I deal with most The camera on this phone is WAY better than my last phone Takes great pictures in low light with great focus and clarity even when zoomed in
My only complaint is that the touch screen is super sensitive I barely need to touch it to type or open an app so click links accidentally a lot I get a new phone every 18 months There I said it You may be thinking Dude thats crazy Phones dont change that much Well Im here to tell you that they do

My Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is genuinely lightyears ahead of the phones Ive had in just the past 2 years Its absurd Its seriously scary better 

The camera Im not a photography guru by any means but I do love taking pictures The one thing I hate about taking pictures is waiting for my camera app to open and focus With this phone I literal double tap the home button and Im there No waiting no focusing instantly Also I can take a picture in the dark down the stairs to my basement and zoom in to see the specs of kitty litter on the floor No joke 

The screen Breathtaking I wasnt a believer in the curved edge on previous phones but theyve absolutely nailed it Also the edge panel apps are easily accessed and I find myself adding functions daily 

I can honestly go on and on flawless wireless charging great speakers exceptional battery life crazy speed even the physical buttons feel sturdy and give a satisfying click Oh yeah I forgot they brought back expandable memory I am seriously beyond impressed with this phone 

I usually have no problem tossing my phone to the rep after a year and a half and saying boot me up the latest model but this one Im really growing attached to I would say if youre on the fence and your phone is over a year old its worth considering the upgrade You will not be disappointed

Jon F Best phone I have had I started with the galaxy 2 and keep on upgrading to a new galaxy This phone is outstanding My favorite feature is the camera The quality is almost better than real life I couldnt be happier This is by far the best Galaxy series phone I have ever used I started at the S3 and progressed through the entire series Each time Samsung takes a product and makes it better Now that Samsung has added longer battery life the memory card option back its perfect Performance look feel are across the board off the charts good The S7 is slimmer than the S6 and performs well It doesnt seem to utilize as much RAM to operate as the S6 does which makes it more efficient I like to bigger phone due to my eyes and the brighter screen help me see good I have always had a Samsung smart phone and will continue to do so The S7 is an upgrade you will notice from the previous versions It is very intuitive and full featured model With the added safety of water resistance its great for any enviornment I recommend it Wish it had the IR blaster and I want more battery I know its the biggest one but if I am on it all day using the Internet or app the battery only goes 34 of the day
I want a bigger battery please I moved from the 6 edge plus to the 7 edge Little slimmer fits nicely in my hand Picture clarity is amazing Multitasking is easy havent had any problems I have been working hard on getting my friends and family to upgrade Absolutely love my S7 edge the phone is blazing fast compared to my S6 I will not own another samsung without the curved edges on it there are just so many options for customization on the edge panels I love that samsung carried over themes it keeps my phone feeling fresh and new it makes my friends quite jealous I have no complaints everything i want in a phone is here I super love my new S7 I upgraded to the S7 edge from a Galaxy S5 and was pleasantly surprised how refined this phone is Unlike the S5 there is absolutely no lag even when I have many apps open The battery life is incredible lasting with moderate use through a long day with plenty of power to spare Always on display and the wireless charging are very convenient and the camera takes amazing pictures I gave it 4 starts on features because Samsung did away with the IR blaster which I will sorely miss You wont be disappointed with this phone I have occasional network connectivity issues which may not be a problem with the phone itself The edge screen is difficult to get used to and I type or press the wrong thing frequently Getting a phone case helps a bit with this Overall better performance and battery life than my S5 I work in retail of cellular devices and I am a huge advocate of Samsung products I love my new device and it is the first phone I recommend to my customers It is really worth the investment Superb battery life Best camera Ive had on a phone Handy features Applications do not eat up RAM Smooth functioning So far every iPhone user has been in awe over this phone I couldnt be any happier that I waited This is a great phone It takes awesome quality pictures and even has a new features that allows you to see 34 secs of each picture taken and allows you to recapture it anywhere between those 34seconds The neat part about this phone is its ability to be water resistant so I can take pictures on rainy days without worry about my phone getting damage The new Galaxy S7 Edge is a top quality phone Frankly it is an IPhone killer Screen display is stunning feels great in your hand and looks amazing Everything about this phone says own me Add additional storage water resistant and its the best of Samsung Do yourself a favor and joint the Samsung Galaxy Nation I damaged my S6 which caused me to consider the upgrade The I was further enticed with the oculusworthless I took it out of the box for 10 min and packed it back up I see no improvements from the S6 to S7 in actual use I would be happier with a smaller screen and a bigger battery It barely makes it through a day without recharge Not worth the upgrade I do prefer android over apple and expandable memory but it isnt what I was expecting it works and runs fast great picture quality and love how it records the short videos before you capture picturex This smartphone Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best smartphone I have ever owned I made the move from my iphone Several models over several years to this phone and was somewhat hesitant but this phone just outperforms and outdoes the iphone on every level This is the most intuitive phone I have ever used and the easiest to use as well Ease of navigation and switching between several screens is effortless The camera and pictures are the best of any phone I have owned or used Call clarity is excellent in all types of situations
BTW  I NEVER review products or do surveys about them they are all so subjective in my opinion but I had to make an exception here This phone will not disappointment Very nice phone for the price Very clear pictures and display Iv been a Samsung fan for quite some time and this phone is top notch The Galaxy s5 was nothing to brag about but the S7 brought back what the 6 was missing I would recommend to all my friends My Samsung Galaxy S7 is absolutely awesome its really fast lightweight and the battery lasts long I love my S7 just one major flaw I would love a universal reversible micro USB port I get tired of trying to figure out which way the plug goes especially in the dark when I am tired

Performance is awesome love the return to a micro SD card that feature is critical to me Camera is great size and weight a no issue Love it I love the sleek look and am impressed with the phone camera and its many features Very happy with my purchase This is my first Samsung product I am very impressed with ease of use as well as the performance Its a great phone Ive had it for a couple weeks and its been great so far The Samsung S7 edge runs smooth with HD and has very helpful tools and runs great with my gear I came from a Galaxy Note 4 which was an awesome phone as well However it was a little too big and I never used the pen so I moved to this phone First the phone is perfect size zips along with ease is very smooth looks great and has a pretty decent battery life 

Im not a power user by any stretch but I go from 545 am to 1100 pm through my work week and am only down to the mid 60 range of battery Pretty good 

I highly recommend this phone It is awesome The camera on this phone is great Even the front camera takes wonderful pics Although I wish it wish it was a little bigger but the size is just right I love this photo and the only problem I can say is the text could use some improvement with the lagging Other than that Im happy I switched from iPhone To say the least Samsung keeps improving
They have made the new Samsung S7 very easy to use and they have provided a lot of instruction to go along while you are learning your new phone
The camerapicture quality is amazing
I love it This phone is a total upgrade from the S6 I would recommend this phone to everyone It has everything you need in a phone the S7 edge is beautiful hands down no questions asked everyone says it so it must be true it is but the problem still lies in other things i tend to hit the edge a lot when gaming so i have to buy a case now that ive covered up the beautiful back its just a shame in the end its a beauty vs utility issue honestly i dont mind it either This phone has been perfect Especially good is the camera Takes great photos in any lighting This is a beautiful phone The best Samsung phone yet let alone the best phone Ive ever had It has an amazing display takes beautiful pictures has a great battery and so much more I recommend this phone and all galaxy phones to all of my friends Until it was released I never thought Im gonna buy this phone
until I realized this is a cellphone that Ive dreaming for  featurewise

 Hi capacity battery
 IP68 certified
 Dual Pixel CMOS sensor
 Fastest mobile processor in the market right now Snapdragon 820

The rest of the feature are pretty typical Samsung phoneSuperAmoledLTE etcetc

the camera is great Pretty boss phone Could be bigger is the only complaint Ive been a fan of Samsung phones for the past several years I owned a Galaxy S2 S3 and S6 Each one of those devices had several features I loved but none were perfect The Galaxy S7 is by far the most complete phone experience I have ever had A quality feel great battery life water resistance and plenty of horsepower 

Samsung Continue on this path of making quality phones with great battery life and you will have a customer for life No need to create gimmicky features Just a good phone super fast i have to get used to like any other new phone but other than that its great it made its own folders for some apps which is great Ive been using this device since the launch date All but great CPU and RAM performance

the GPU is amazing Awesome phone It has almost everything I need for home and office Very hot I mead hot can be cook the egg for it 100 to 0  only take 4 hours of not use the phone of batter life Hope is defeated phone I will give other try when come to avertible on waiting list for news S7 Edge be come avertible I have return it I dont to send in for warranties repair The features are nice and the overall performance is good however it will not stay connected to a WiFi connection making it very difficult to get normal day to day tasks done Numerous complaints online for the same reason with no fix in sight Hopefully the next firmware update will fix this I love this phone best phone purchase Ive made in awhile Great design and the phone feels perfect in my hand Ive been upgrading with Galaxy phones for about five years now and each time Samsung introduces a superb phone The speaker quality is loud and clear taking pictures and videos just keep getting better and twice Ive dropped my phone in water and my phone didnt get damaged Its just a great phone I cannot even imagine what the next one will be like My s7 us the best phone I have owned yet The battery life is amazing and the screen is so beautiful I had an S4 and thought that was great The S7 is better The only problem is that for some reason I cant get my Peelon App to work Other than that I love my new S7 I have had a galaxy s3 since it came out so getting a new phone was scary Because the new phone is a galaxy s7  But it was so easy to use  And I quickly became so at ease using it  I absolutely love it and the features are fantastic I love milk music I brought the Galaxy S7 the same day it was released and I truly love it The best Galaxy yet lightning fast and a lot of memory I love the Samsung 7 I had the 4 loved it then broke it had a 3 as back up I hated the 3  The 7 is fast easy to use all out wonderful fone Recommended everyone gets it I am in love with the 7 Edge I would not trade it for any other phone Perfect pictures
Excellent design
Inexpensive
Waterproof It has been a good experience using the Galaxy S7 I was expecting bugs but I have not come across any Battery last all day display is vibrant camera is top notch phone is fast speaker is loud PLUS water dust resistance I had the Galaxy S6 Edge and I liked it but it had a few annoying flaws The S7 edge seems to address all the issues I had with the S6 and then some Its waterproof and the battery is amazing The screen is so huge I feel like I have a mini laptop in my hand With this phone I can do all things Just got my new S7 earlier this month and love it Camera is fantastic Easy to use I really enjoy using the phone in conjunction with the new Gear VR headset It is a lot of fun Coming from a S4 the Galaxy S7 has a lot of upgrades Great screen resolution faster speed larger screen better design They also brought back the external memory card drive which is something I didnt want to give up with my S4 The battery life also seems longer Overall the S7 was worth the wait and the upgrade This is the first phone Ive ever purchased on release day and I have no regrets I have had my phone for almost 2 weeks now and couldnt be happier The camera takes fantastic pictures in low light conditions just like the commercial states The screen is super sharp Not much of a learning curve coming from the S4 Still tweaking some of the settings but that is to be expected Overall I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7 to anyone thinking of purchasing a new smartphone You wont be disappointed When i first got this phone two buttons did not work but with a simple software update everything was fixed and i have tested it to the extreme I dropped it in 20 ft of water without knowing and thirty minutes later it still worked Has an SD card slot I like the camera Fast charging and long battery life Samsung has done it again The s5 was the best out there wben I bought it and now I have the S7 and it is even better than the S5 and the competition Features product and SAMSUNG PAY Water resistant and expandable storage Best phone Ive ever owned I must plea to people to get this product Its smooth and fluent to travel throughout the phone Features I love
External memory a definite plus
Battery life is awesome 
Wireless charger option no fumbling with cords Anyone can write about how great this phone is it really is But the biggest drawback is that the only screen protectors you can get are either horribly overpriced glass ones that only have adhesive on top and bottom and are just plain terrible or the cheap plastic ones that do a terrible job holding on to the Edge I came from the iOS world and was a loyal user all the way up to the current generation But they seem to be falling behind This Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge on the other hand has everything Ive been missing and more Every feature I can think of is either builtin or exists in the app store I am very happy with this purchase I really love the display and the newest camera features This is the BEST Galaxy yet Its got all the features of previous models that you loved and none of the stuff that made me disappointed with the s6 I especially love the low light camera and the sd card slot Its the best of the best so far I give it 4 stars because Im order to get 5 Ive got to have zero complaints My only complaint is the speaker Its in such an awkward place I find that Im often covering it up accidentally with the way I hold my phone when Im gaming or watching videos Well that and the fact that some apps werent preinstalled forcing users to use SamsungGoogle Apps for certain things like the music player The quality is what you expect from SamsungExcellent The price is right even a bargain for what you get with this phone It is easy for the not so tech savvy to use as well as packed with fun techie gadgets for the tech guru to be satisfied I picked this phone up a couple of days ago So far I am enjoying it and its features The double tap on the home button to open up the Camera is a nice touch to catch those precious moments of your children that come and go so quickly The screen is bright and clear The touch screen feels very accurate and even though this phone is smaller than the Note3 I came from it is easier to text on There are however a few things I may change with this phone or phones to come out in the future The S7s design is elegant and smooth but with this smoothness comes a con If your hands have any sort of moisture or natural skin oil on them this thing feels like it will slip right out of your hand I highly recommend a case who doesnt buy one The other con I have is the battery life This is probably due to the fact I came from the Note3 and it has a much larger battery capacity I was literally watching the battery go down with light usage the power saver feature on and the screen brightness as low as I could have it and still make out what is was on it I closed all backround apps I hope in the future phones get thicker to help support larger batteries and to fit better in your hand Camera on this device is amazing pictures come out clear and has some nice features The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an awesome phone and I absolutely love itwhen its not dead Seriously for all the great features this device has I am greatly disappointed that Samsung did not support it with at least reasonable battery life No wonder they need the fast charging feature

That trademark Samsung delay when navigating around the OS is everpresent I come to expect that at this point though so no big deal

Also it would be nice to have all notifications turned off out of the box so the user can choose which apps to receive notifications from rather than being spammed with hundreds of notifications when turning on the phone for the first time The phone works great after hours of tweaking ridiculous impractical outofthebox settings Having spent the time I now love the phone This is by far the best phone I have ever owned Everything from the design to the very intuitive operation is fantastic with the Samsung s7 Edge Well done Samsung It works to all my needs and i love it I use it every day and it never fails to amaze My S7 is a smartphone on steroids the VR Gear just turned the tech world on its head Best smartphone ever Display is amazing and camera which was not a selling point for me is just crazy Love it love it did I tell ya that I love it Took like a 1000 pictures now Im like a pro with this thing I have been a Samsung user for years and I can truly say they have stepped up this time I will take this over and IPhone any day I have owned several Samsung phones but this one is the best ever I love the look how fast it is and the functionality 

My only concern at the moment is how sensitive the edge screen can be When Im typing sometimes the edge can accept input when I dont want it too I hear that this has been reported and will be fixed Im sure

If you want or need a new phone Id go with this one It is the perfect size I went from a s5 to this S7 Edge and I am soooo impressed with the design and the layout of everything is amazing Its so fast Clear sound I am just sooo happy that i bought this new phone right away I show it off and brag about it all the time The new front facing camera is a great improvement from previous models The pictures are so crisp and clear Love the low light shots it takes too You will be amazed at what you can see in the low light pictures Software is also great everything is fast and smooth Sound is a little twangy compared to previous models but Ill take that in exchange for being water resistant any day Im nervous to try underwater pictures but Im eager to take some 
Overall great phone loving mine This is by far the best phone that Ive ever owned including the phone I returned in exchange for this I especially like Samsung Pay the camera and the overall performance of the device I would highly recommend this phone love the new phonelove the vrlike that its waterproof This phone has a great camera It takes beautiful pictures Fast auto focus Lots of different settings for selfies too The camera is awesome The additional features on the phone are great The expandable memory is a plush In the past I tended to stay away from Samsung phones After getting the Galaxy S7 I see how wrong I was This phone is awesome The is my first Galaxy and it was worth the wait It is ultra fast really clear has the best camera and is waterproof I love it Great phone Upgraded from S4 Battery life is excellent Overall quality is great Recommend to anyone including iPhone users I had the Galaxy S4 a few years ago and now have stepped up to the S7 I love the phone I wouldnt own anything else The samsung S7 was compared to just about all other cell phones before i made the decision to buy my previous cell phone was the S5The only problem i have found with the S7 is after installing protective case it becomes a bit heavy but i can live with this considering all the other excellent features Love the Galaxy S series phones Very happy Samsung brought back the SD card memory upgrade Not sure yet if I am happy about the internal battery though Everything else is outstanding Ive had this for about a month and it worked like lightning at first Then I noticed after an update that it started not working on WIFI very good and now my battery drains faster Some what disappointed in that I was skeptical to buy such a new phone It is very easy to use and has so many options to personalize It has good battery life and the fast charge is great I love it Very happy with my decision enjoy the new phone it works well and is easy to use This phone is great I love everything about it but when youre watching a video on this its so vibrant and beautiful I have the Galaxy 5 and I love that but this one is so much better good job Upgrading from an S4 to an S7 was a great choice The S7 is much faster better organized and just feels really nice I like my phone naked no case and it feels great to hold Expandable memory is great Battery life is much better for me too
Havent tested out the water resistance yet
My one complaint is that sometimes it seems the screen might be a little too sensitive For example my finger is close to the screen but hasnt quite touched it yet and it will recognize it as a touch My galaxy s7 is so user friendly and fun to have It makes my life a little easier with the wireless charging and s health is consistently asking me questions that it didnt ask with my galaxy s5 so my data on it is mpre accurate I also am loving my music player The only thing i wouls change is the screen to have it completely flat because my glass screen protector wont adhere to the sides because theyre ever so slightly rounded Phone is very easy to use Im not phone save but I have no problems with this phone Instructions are easy to follow Imade impressed i upgraded from the S5 has a lot of the same stuff a few different the camera is amazing in low light if u take pictures in the dark The GS7 Edge with its beautiful side to side screen and elegant curves makes this smart phone esthetically pleasing to the eye The screen and cameras resolutions are amazing along with quick auto focus under any kind of lighting and your photos will come out looking great Also the phone is water resistant making it a great value for your money Very fast
Love the feel in my hand
Love that the time and date stays on the screen when its off
Picture quality is greatsomehow thinks my note 4 picture quality is better 
Ive had the phone for a month now I have seen it turn onoff on its own 3 times not sure why 
Overall a great buy I broke down and brought this phone for my teenager along with the protection plan He had the S3 so I decided to upgrade for his 16th Bday A VR was included with the purchase and was the selling point for me He loves it and I am amazed at the features that it has I think the VR is too cool also The water resistance feature was a plus I highly recommend this phone for anyone who loves new technology for themselves or as in my case as a gift I have been a Samsung user for years so I am kind of biased I went from the S4 to the S7 and I am pleased with the new phone 
What I liked the most was the ease in transferring all my S4 apps files and such to the S7 and it took only a few minutes
It has several new features but that doesnt keep you from having any severe learning curves
Great phone and Great Company Love this phone Perfect size high performance excellent display  excellent camera  Love its features its the best Ive ever had Cant believe how fast it is wish I had bought one sooner The features are so much better than Ive ever had The product is much better than I thought it would beIt is lightning fast easy to use easy to hold full of features that are useful in everyday life I would recommend this phone to a friend as a matter of fact I will be getting one for my wife The display and app are far better then apple and the software Isolutions easy to learn This phone is a very nice upgrade from my previous Galaxy S4 The Always On Display is a handy feature so that you always know the time The return of the SD card slot will also help free up internal storage The battery lasts all day for me One of the only downsides is that there are a lot of settings to go through and some of them are hidden several layers deep Otherwise this is a great phone and I would highly recommend it I waited for this phone a long time I kept the S5 cause the S6 didnt cut it However this phone is AWESOME It has more memory a faster processor the sdcard is back a nice camera and a sleek design 

The battery gets me through the day without a recharge and phone conversations are very clear The internet speed tests conducted yields explosive updownload rates I am also impressed with the screen it is very bright very clear and very responsive

The phone in my opinion is near perfect The only changes I would make is the placement of the speakers They are at the bottom of the phone so sound is projected downward Also a removable battery would be nice

Wireless charging is a great feature no new back or case is required it is already part of the phone The biometric security feature is all included and a MUST for any phone I would consider 


BOTTOMLINE The Galaxy S7 is by far a technological giant standing tall and all alone against its competition Samsung stuck their foot in this phone I have been a Samsung user for about 3 years now and may I say that I have no regrets This has been the best investment yet The new S7 delivers pretty much everything one could ask for in a phone especially for night time use I love love love it Upgraded from my Galaxy S5 two weeks ago outdated slow clogged up with useless data and pretty impressed with the s7 Edges performance and screen so far not to mention battery life Still need to get used to the edges of the screen After two weeks I keep touching the edges when watching a video or reading an article and mess it up Only had one issue since Ive had the phone and that was with a call Had so much static that I had to reboot my phone but since Ive had the phone that was the only issue Screen is nice and colorful Faster than any phone I have had It even picks up in areas were signals are weak Highly recommend it Great and big enough display 
Very impressed with the ease of use I love how crisp and vivid the screen is I love that i can put in a micro sd card and expand my storage I love how lighting fast the phone is all around the phone is amazing The only eye sore for me is the battery I will pull phone off charger and the battery literary melts away I use my phone lightly at most i run spotfy while at work which i understand can kill a battery When im at home and i want to check Facebook for two mins the battery drops very fast it makes my head spin how fast it drains even in power save mode Thrilled to see that the water proof feature is back when I had my S6 I was quite upset they took it away as a feature Love the return of using a memory card as I am currently using a 200GB one in my phone Battery life is slightly improved but not as much as I expected unfortunately I am so excited that Samsung listened to consumers This phone is the best ever The design is fantastic so easy to use And the camera is amazing Thank you Samsung The only problems Ive had some the power and volume down button stopped working and was fixed by just a restart And the phone keeps trying to open split screen when Im not pressing the button Other than that this phone is much better than my last phone gs6 which I loved until the day I got this phone I have two problems so far the finger a canner does not work properly no matter how many times I reset it also the Cameron freezes and some times cant take pictures Lets start out by saying this phone is beautiful looking phone that has a display to match Samsung this year listened to their fans and brought back expandable memory I am also proud of them of actually making the phone a little bigger to add a bigger battery to the mix Being a loyal Samsung customer this is by far the best Samsung phone They have listened to customers and have included all the features that have been requested Perfect size wonderful pictures great speed and battery life It has it all This is truly a great phone Its the best Samsung phone I have ever owned Fast Sleek Beautifully made It has met or exceeded my expectations One caveat the battery life is slightly disappointing I thought the larger battery would provide much more power than I actually get Battery life is about average can only make it thru about 23 of a day I would have expected to get thru a full day Hoping battery life does improve other than that a very nice phone Love security with fingerprint and memory card slot I love my new phone The camera is great and im enjoying all the new features Flaw is still a clunky OS though greatly improved IP68 and external memory support is awesome Vast improvement over S6 in all aspects especially a better edge interface and snappiness of performing many actions Battery life and charging is much longer and faster respectively The best phone Ive ever owned I was so excited when hearing about the release of the S7 I kind of lost it This was my 19th birthday gift and the S7 actually was released on the same day as my birthday March 11th so it was a sign I was supposed to have this phone one of the best gifts I could ever receive hands down The phone is fast sleek vibrant and beautiful with its metallic finish I feel this is the best phone on the market best phone of 2016 and it barely started and Im glad I chose the best smartphone company on the market I like the fingerprint scanner and the fact that it is water resistant I also like the expandable memory The Galaxy S7 is a great phone It is the perfect size and come with a lot of great features First I cant wake the phone with voice commands when the screen is offNot a big deal Second The maximum volume when using wired headphones is not as loud as it was on the Note 4VERY BIG DEAL PLEASE increase the volume levels in wired headphones mode on future devices Other than that its a beautiful device that performs great This is the most beautiful and comfortable phone on the market right now and into the rest of 2016 It checks all the checkboxes of a critical smartphone user good experience sharp and accurate screen if using the basic color profile great contactless payments fast accurate camera and stunning device to look at among other things 

Coming from an iPhone 5s and the very refined and solid operating system I was very picky about my next phone A consistent obvious and straightforward UI was very important to me because of its ability to let me get things done quickly The Galaxy S7 has an excellent app called Samsung Smart Switch that lets one quickly and easily move their text messages contacts applications it gives a list of the apps that you have installed on your previous phone and offers links to download them through the play store for ones that arent on the playstore it offers a list of similar apps memos and reminders 

An accurate screen that is usable in any condition is the single most important thing in a smartphone Beautiful photos that are shared between friends needs to feature the same colors and vividness and the S7 is able to do just that 

Samsung Pay is the best contactless payment system by far Its ability to work with both NFC terminals as well as traditional magnetic card swipe based terminals makes it an excellent secure way of shopping at brick and mortars especially in the United States where we are slow to adopt the newer better chip and pinchip and sign system 

Overall this is a great phone that does many things right and few things wrong Its a phone that is easy to recommend to any user be it a power user or one that wants the simplicity of an iPhone in a more rounded pun intended package Awesome product with great features and great performance see for your self Although I will probably not pour champagne on my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge it is water resistant submersible up to 5 ft for 30 minutes I think I enjoy the many features such as having the time displayed while the device screen is off It moves periodically across the screen to prevent burning an image into the display It works with my Samsung wireless charger that I also used on my Galaxy S6 Edge but only with thin cases or no case The expandable memory card slot comes in handy and the Samsung Smart Switch makes transferring data a breeze The Samsung Smart Switch is located in settings under Backup and Reset instead of being in the app tray Overall Im very impressed and satisfied with my new purchase Very pleased that the sd card holder came back Ergonomics improved over s6 I have owned the S7 Edge for almost 2 weeks and am very happy with it The screen is beautiful the speed is excellent and the battery life is very good I switched from a iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy 7 and I will never go back every thing is better on the galaxy I love android and this phone is thank you for making it First phone was DOA Replacement is fine I have the Edge I find the touch sensitivity a little too sensitive This phone of course has flaws But it is still perfect in many ways The volume is better the quality is better dont forget the battery is longer lasting its waterproof and the design is just beautiful I love the health app as well I forgot to mention that the phone is pretty durable I tend to drop things so its good My old iPhone cant compete with this phone Although I dont like the edge screen that much I would get the normal s7 but this one has better battery life My finger would sometimes slip on the screen and activate something I dont need at the moment Im not saying you should get rid of it for many people enjoy it Oh and the camera is also great Samsung keeps learning from their past phones and keeping what was good and improving what wasnt This phone has many great features Im still waiting for a solar charger built into the phone Love the phone Gave 4 star because I have a defected phone The lock button and the down volume button on the side stopped working a day after I got the phone Cant turn the phone off or turn the volume down Waiting for more phones to come in so I can exchange phones Stunning display fast processor can add memory Only negative a bit large and can slip out of my hand if I dont hold it tight unlike the S4 I can adapt to it but some might not be able to do so Also for some reason group messaging is not functioning properly since messages appear in separate conversations Trying my best to learn all features Beautiful phones Ive owned 3 Galaxy S phones prior to the S7 Minus the nonremovable battery the S7 is by better than the rest I take a lot of pics with my phone and the quality is outstanding Dont let the downsizing back to a 12m turn you away The downsize made the camera and features better Larger pixels and Ultra High Def for example The speaker is located on the bottom of the phone which improved the sound quality The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a big upgrade from the Galaxy S4 that I had I love the addition of the fingerprint scanner it makes getting into the phone quick and easy The phone has a very good battery life also as long as you have power saving mode on This phone has fast processor and nice camera on the plus side Coming over from galaxy s5 I miss the ir blaster I used for remote and I miss the ability to play video from a direct connection from the charge port to the hdmi in on my TV I also miss the ability to save favorite contacts to my main page Coming from the note 4 I was hesitant to step down but Im glad I did Sleek design that fits better in your pocket and hand workout feeling like you have sacrificed the screen size Overall image feel the same Camera is second to none Lots of new features that I still am exploring Processing capabilities are fantastic and snappy No more screen lag Edge features are nice but not crucial However the addition of the edge shortcuts and buddies are a great addition Samsung pay is awesome I use it often They finally put the speaker somewhere other than the back Charging port headphones jack and speaker all located on bottom Woohoo

If considering this device you will not be disappointed I previously had the S5 and the S3 I noticed a significant difference between the first two but I have yet to find a whole lot of difference between the S7 and the S5 The camera improved Some small features that I used to be able to tweek arent tweekable anymore which kinda bums me out Seems to charge faster I kinda wish Id waited for the new Note to upgrade Its a great phone but Ive already had problems with it On one occasion it froze and made a weird buzzing sound But thats about all Great none the less the battery charges super fast it last all day movies look amazing it takes awesome pictures is the best samsung Ive ever had Needs to come with more features there almost all the same as the s5 galaxy which was water proof Samsung products are always top of the line I love my new Samsung 7 Edge Everywhere I go people are asking about my phone I have had several individuals going back to their phone provider to change there phones The power of SAMSUNGYes Great phone desing performance style everything Very happy with it I love the camera on this phone Takes awesome photos I was sceptical to switch from an iPhone to an android product but this phone does so much plus more I love this phone I chose the edge because of the unique features that the edge screen offers I love the screen clarity I also love how it is water resistant I recommend this phone to all of my friends I have had my Galaxy S7 for about two weeks now I love the design and sleekness of it The processing speed is fantastic As usual it is easy to maneuver and operate Ive had an issue with my phone shutting off and restarting its self I need to take it in to have it checked out This phone is way better than the s5 I would recommend this phone to anyone I recently purchased the S7 and upgraded from the Note Edge much better product A clean look with a crisp display the UI works very well and the phone doesnt have previous models problems My only con so far is the fingerprint unlock works when it wants to The S7 has definitely kept me in the Samsungandroid family yet again I didnt know what to really expect when purchasing this phone besides the water resistant quality When I went and got the phone I was able to get on the phone with ease and find more things such as new camera quality with new futures I upgraded from the s4 to the s7 The galaxy has come pretty far along in those 2 years Its setup is pretty much the same so navigating it is a breeze Its a much faster phone and still has the capability to add a SD card Overall Im very happy with the purchase and would not want any other phone on the market I have had Samsungs since the Galaxy S3 I will not switch I switched from IPhone to galaxy best decision I have ever made The S5 is great I like there are more options on the edge The camera option in the dim light is awesome Both my daughters have gone to Galaxy phones Plus I have switched friends from I phone to Galaxy The screen is clear and sharp The S5 is light and I like that it is water resistant I am a Samsung owner for life I get a new phone ever time one comes out I own Samsung tablets also I cant wait to see what Samsung comes out with in the future I have never been let down each phone is better and better Absolutely a delight Only thing that drives me crazy is trying to set phone up I am beginning to really like most of the features of this phone but there is a downside Im really frustrated with the fact i cant connect to my car stero through USB my S5 did Secondly I got locked out and had to do a factory reset and im 99 sure it was the correct pin Lastly I feel like ive had to do a lot of research just to find little cool things the phone does Loving the camera features fingerprint scan works great  I love the color Overall great phone but at times missing my S5 I switched from a Note 3 for the S7 At first I found it hard to adjust having been a Note user for so long After a week I was use to having a small phone and I have been loving the features The one I love the most is the pulse sensor which allows me to take selfies just by putting a finger on it This saves me from having to use my other hand I upgraded from a s6 The battery is so much better I am getting a couple of days I love everything about my GS7 Edge Only thing I would change is I wish the IR Blaster wasnt removed  I wish Samsung  ATT would roll out the new Android OS updates faster Im patiently awaiting the gear VR in the mail  cant wait to immerse myself into another great product of Samsung I am impressed with the processing speed and design appearance The options are so many and nice to personalize to my liking I really like the fast camera focus best Ive seen in a phone Battery seems to be much longer Absolutely love the wireless charging I dont notice anything for the design of the phone as I use a complete cover case for my unexpected protection I did notice a new feature I had not heard about When on call with 3 person party call call waiting still comes up However I would like to see more options for edge option not many to choose from I do miss the noise reduction option for when on a call And would like to see the phone not all glass This phone is easy to use has a really good battery life and the battery charges two times as fast as my last phone It has a lot of built in apps that are just specifically for Samsung Galaxy 7s which makes using your phone easier and way more convenient thank you Samsung for this great product Great phone Took the best of the S5 and the S6 and rolled them into one package Battery life is great the SD card slot is a welcome return Water resistantance is a major benefit I love the S7 Its incredibly fast and the battery life is far better than any of my previous Samsung phones This is why I keep sticking with Samsung They always have quality products and this is definitely one of them Keep up the great work Samsung This is another great step for the S serried of phone I have owned multiple smart phones and multiple phones in the S series This is my favorite one to date I like this phone better than the iPhones Ive owned Micro SD card slot upto 200gb is back to the phone I put 128gb to enjoy music pictures music videos as well as video One of Samsung smart phone advantage is this feature One uncomfortable feature for SD catd slot with SIM card slot which needs to be careful pull out in and out of the micro sd card Unfortunately Samsung dropped battery replacement feature but it seems ok Ovetall i am happy to extend storage in Samsung Galaxy phone I went from the s5 to the s7 Did not like that the s6 did not have an SD card Really like the s7 it has been great so far The camera is amazing and great new features and its water resistant Great overall Ive had the S7 edge for a few weeks now and love it Unfortunately it is not as durable as I hoped One week after I purchased the phone it slipped off the couch onto the carpet and cracked the screen This is a amazing phone that I recommend everyone who is know Best phone Ive ever owned Ive owned a ton Once the patch for Edge being so sensitive is released it will be perfect This is by far the best Samsung device yet I have owned the S3 S4 S5 S6 Note 3 and Note 4 This phone is the perfect size and packed full of the best technology available The wireless charging is great and very convenient I wasnt sure if I was going to like the Samsung Galaxy S 7 edge or not but after buying and trying I have to say that it is the fastest easiest phone I have ever purchased I Love this phone The phone is thinner lighter and has a great new back The phone runs faster and is easy to use The camera has great new features This product is fantastic it has endless possibilities All of the apps work phenomenally and the phone itself works great Great quality This phone is very fast Great features Easy to use While I miss the stylus of the Note II that I had prior to the edge all of the other features blow the Note II out of the picture

I got a great deal thru Verizon so that Im not out hundreds of dollars all at once and because it was on the V I can use it anywhere

I spoke to a friend at work that owns the 6 edge and he was impressed with the response of my phone I like the 4 screens of the edge especially the compassflashlight feature 5 levels of light for the flashlight is awesome

Still playing with the other functions and apps that are available to me and will probably update my review after Ive spent some time doing that I find the Internet to be very slow Galaxy 7 is slower than the 5 or 6 The phone itself is the right size to handle Camera is ok I dont find anything spectacular with this phone to make it worth the money I paid After owning several products by Samsung it is good to see that Samsung listens to there customers Having the option to add more memory to the phone and being water proof is a couple of features that standout The s7 is a great phone easy to use and with many new features puts this phone above and beyond all others GS 6 was good but was not able to add more memory wished the camera was a little bit better too many unwanted apps was unable to remove other that these minor things its a great phone Looks great little difficult typing but getting use to it The good functionally works well Screen size appropriate 
The bad Battery dies quick The notification bar gets compromised by the protective case Square reader access limited unless no cover 
The ugly Nothing really Is a nice phone Great phone light weight and fast Great display Great camera I really appreciate the new screen  much better visibility in daylight The camera focus occurs much quicker and photos are better Minor wish  I was used to be able to replace the battery on my S4 so could attach a larger back that had a much longer life battery which is no longer possible I absolutely love my phone It looks great and functions also I also love the looks I get people realize the phone that I have I would recommend this to anyone as this has been my most favorite product which is Samsung and not iPhone because Samsung performance is much better This phone is very easy to use and very fun to see what features it offers I really like this phone Big upgrade from the S6 I compared to other phones and this one is the best I would recommend to anyone looking for a new phone

Features and reliability is what I would expect from this phone Great phone with very good quality just wish it didnt get so hot reallyquick This phone may be one of the best smart phones on the market It does a price which is appropriate for this level of performance It has an excellent camera that works well in low light situations You can use an sd card for more memory which is nice I like the wireless charging feature too Battery charges in about 2 hours On the negative side the battery is not removable  Loved the way it feels Really great to hold and to look at I have enjoyed this phone It runs fast The battery last days if your not on it much or all day if you are on it well all day Charges super fast The only thing that is a negative is the edges of the glass are slightly rolled and Ive heard it wont keep a screen saver on because of this So I have avoided buying one Didnt want to go back to an all encompassing case like a life proof because they are so bulky but that may be what I have to get My boss has this same phone and the screen cracked the first drop when it slid down his leg It was a light drop Overall I love the layout of the phone the display is beautiful and it takes wonderful pictures perfect companion and fall in love My friends are looking forward to buy it soon Durable waterresistant beautiful pictures crystal clear screen images excellent battery life that resists overheating all packaged in an aesthetically pleasing bundle of perfection Couldnt ask for more I like it a lot Well worth the wait Cant wait to see whats next Typing keys missing microphone for speech to text Luke speaking get hands free for text Every new feature on this phone is fantastic I love the display on so I dont have to turn the phone on to see the time The visual voicemail is so convenient and the screen shot with your hand WOW My pictures from the camera are simply beautiful and the focus features really add some pizzazz to my pictures 

I really love everything about this new phone and will recommend it to everyone Way to go Samsung I upgraded from a Galaxy Alpha and I couldnt be happier This phone has amazing features and I love howiChat I can personalize it A Great phone and extremely fast Awesome screen color Ive had the s3 5 and 7 Im no expert just a guy who loves his phone I like the smaller S7 its easier to carry and fits pockets better The camera operation is better The speaker is on the bottom edge so you hear it better I dont understand the faster part I dont really see a difference but than Im not a gamer However for the money I dont think its worth the upgrade If I could back the deal up I would Everything about this phone is an upgrade I love the screen the camera the edge I love it all Best phone Samsung has ever put out The camera alone is worth buying this phone and the battery life is unbeatable What a great phone I loved my S5 and didnt think anything could replace it I was wrong So far this phone has exceeded all my expectations Easy to use Feels comfortable in hand Very good camera I love my new Galaxy Super fast beautiful screen and clarity Only thing I find that needs improving is the battery life my old Galaxy S4 could go for days without being charged This one eats the batteries like crazy I generally have to plug it in everyday at least an extra time to make sure it stays on Lately I just set it down on the charger to make sure it is always ready to go Also hate that one has to use the little tool to get to the extra storage disk Cant wait until I misplace that little item and no longer have access to the disk Have only had the phone for about 3 weeks The only thing I miss from my Galaxy S5 is volume for alarm Cant exactly wear hearing aids to bed so need the extra volume for the alarm Havent used all the features yet but will I have loved every Samsung product From TV to phones to accessories but the Samsung S7 Edge is mind blowing Water proof scratch resistant sleek design You name it This is another great step by Samsung Keep up the good work Samsung I love my new Samsung s7 edge I cant wait until I get my glasses to play my games I would recommend this phone to everybody The curved edges make the phone Beautiful look and feel The battery life is much better and quickly charges Camera options are a nice upgrade It is really unfair to compare the two models The S7 with added RAM faster processor really outperforms and brings modern computing to the palm of your hand As a computer reseller I push the limits of my mobile devices to perform as my i7 laptop Finally a phone that can handle the modern apps and perform PLUS having the advantage of adding memory on the fly with an SD card is awesome The ONLY downside I have found is the slight curve on the standard S7 at the edges If you add a glass screen protector they have a slight halo around the edges I know the manufacturers are quickly trying to rectify that situation and will shortly Outside of that minor design issue outstanding Ive worked in the cell phone industry for 3 years Seems like Samsung is really hit or miss with their products So far after owning the S7 edge for a week I am very impressed I am glad they finally improved on the low light camera sensor Best phone Graphics and camera I love everything about this phone Just upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge This is the greatest phone that I have ever had It is easy to use and the edge features are just and added bonus The battery life is unbelievable Even when the battery runs down the quick charge feature gets you going again The display is phenomenal I have had my Samsung S7 for almost 4weeks now and can say I am so glad I purchased it It has awesome speed on the web either on 4G or WIFI The built in features are great Love the fact it is water resistant No problems hooking it up to my home WIFI or my Sync system in my car The sound is excellent when making a call My only complaint is the keyboard is a bit sensitive and sometimes doubles up on letters while Im typing Have not checked to see if I can turn down touch sensitivity yet Otherwise I am more than happy with my Samsung phone I first received an S7 Edge and some of the pixels around the screen were dead I went back and exchanged it for another one and it was perfect The screen had no imperfections Samsung has hit it out of the park with the new Galaxy S7 Its the best and most stunning phone I have ever owned 

Thrilled to have this phone Phone has the best camera ever Easy to use long battery life
Would recommend this phone to everyone I love this phone its incredibly fast and easy to use out all of the different things that you can put on thats really cool and the VR gear what an amazing experience I love the look and style of this phone it feels really good in your hand and it charges incredibly fast the call Quality is beautiful truly an amazing phone so glad I made the purchase Im on it all the time I would recommend buying a Samsung to anyone very good products the Galaxy series is going to be my favorite theyre very reliable plenty of great apps couldnt ask for anything better I love the expandable memory and the camera is awesome Battery life is great One charge lasts all day Much improved since S6 This phone has awesome capabilities speed and its sleek I have had phone for 2 weeks now and it has been everything I had hoped for The screen is the clearest and sharpest I have seen and the I phone users around me are all jealous The only thing I would hope for more of are the edge apps as there are still limited available 
The best phone experience I habe had Battery Bluetooth and speed are the biggest improvementsurprise I have found from my old Note 4 Ive been thru several samsung phones in my life one after it other and they always excel everytime The Galaxy S 7 Edge is handheld jewelry but so much more It shines  sparkles in every category

The display is captivating Whoever could imagined everything shows up like true reality It has blazing speed  the battery lasts 3 times what my old tradein did Galaxy S5 Im pretty slow on the uptake of high tech stuff but I have already picked up good amount in one week Ill update in afew weeks Thanks Agian Samsung Excellent product and very user friendly Took a few moments to familirize with it and am nor quite comfortable in using it for internet email browsing etc The galaxy s7 is far better than I had expected Its performance is so much faster than my s5 I love it and recommend it to everyone Theres no match cant wait to see what else Samsung comes up with For many years I still with the Sprint but a days ago I decided for a new cell companyand am so Happy The galaxy 7S edge is a great cellI love it Ive always been a fan of samsung products Theyre consistantly innovative I am so glad that this line went back to expandable memory The screen is crystal clear It runs smooth as can be even while playing my most intense games The camera is amazing Ive already recommended the phone to friends and 2 have gotten them They also love them I love this phone Has a lot of features Really fast too I love the style of the phone This phone has a lot of great features great battery life and very fast charging Samsung has done very well with this model Everything is a great improvement over previous models I have encountered 1 problem the screen would not recover from sleep mode until getting into the reset mode it has only happened once but Ive only had it 2 weeks Only thing that could be done to make it perfect would have been to make it slightly thicker and put a larger battery in it This is the most recent of Samsung phones that I have used over the years A great phone which has more features than I could ever use but it is very responsive with texting gmail calendar etc Ease and speed of finger print access S5 never worked well Double clicking to get to camera
Camera is better than s5 
Also had to add additional memory because of all apps pictures etc have on phone
Had a number of Samsung smartphones and this is by far the best one I ever had This is by far the best phone Ive ever had I love the tiny size making it perfect item I use during work versus me using my old phone the galaxy note 3 The water resistant feature is an extraordinary new thing that does not require a bulky case My phone has gotten game rained on and dunked in beach water and it still performs great First off thank you for bringing back the expandable memory I also like the design and feel of the device better than the S6 I really wish the screen were a bit larger I like the size of the new edge but did not want the edge screen I cant wait to use it with the VR goggles My biggest complaint is that the battery life is terrible compared with past my Samsung devices Drains way too quickly and I have to keep a charged mophie with me Just lost almost 30 power in an hour The features of the phone are awesome I love how long the battery lasts and that it is waterproof The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the phone Ive been waiting for It has great functionality and design along with performance The screen is a perfect size along with a very bright AMOLED display Best phone by far The phone works wonders Simple to understand and easy to use Only down fall Ive had so far is with any personal music transferred over theres no just music app to play it off of Theres only the ability to open the song in the files folder I have always been a Samsung owner love there products fastclearnice designs I do and would recommend these products to anyone Ive had every samsung since Galaxy 4 and love love love love love the Galaxy S7 The camera is amazing I run a small business and would be lost with it The majority of what people do now is use the internet on their phone The major loss of battery life from the s6 to the s7 for internet surfing is a huge disappointment The quality of the display is a huge improvement though the display on the s6 was not lacking the s7 shows the difference LOVE the extended memory ability being brough back Its the whole reason i upgraded to the s7 The only other notable difference is the curved backing I have to s5dmit though it actually causes more problems with my hands making contace with the sides of the screen while im holding it and it causes interference All in all if it were for the expanding memory i would go back to my s6 This phone has a great overall look and it runs smoothly with pretty much all games and is very versatile for what you want to do with it The new Samsung Galaxy S7 is user friendly and packed with awesome features Being water resistant is a huge plus for me As well as having expandable memory This is a big win over the S6 Enjoy using my Samsung 7 Very easy to use and does not require a technical degree Screen is bright and easy to read Love the phone but have problem with restarting by its self dont like that u cant find any cases with belt clips for it or very few cases period I had a gs5 and upgraded to the s7 edge I love the features and performance Battery lasts longer also I am very excited to see the accessories they are providing especially gear VR This phone has it all Thank you Samsung keep up the great products My wife needed an new phone so I bought her an S7 edge After setting up her phone and looking at all the features I went out and bought one for myself the next morning I havent even begun to take advantage of all the features but am very impressed and pleased with what I have used and excited about the possibilities that can be had when I finally get around to utilizing the phone to its full potential This product takes great pictures This phone is easy to use This phone is blazing fast both with the apps and surfing the web The pictures are very crisp and clear and I Iove how great they look in low light situations The only bad this about this phone is the price This phone costs as much as my new computer but its like a mini computer in the palm of your hand There are too many things to say about this wondrous device Its just best if everyone buy one and experience it for themselves It is the best when it comes to battery life  speed camera screen resolution My first Samsung phone was a S5 and I was moderately happy with my change I decided to stick with Samsung and got the S7 and I couldnt be happier about the switch It is user friendly great screen Samsung pay and other options make it a must buy I went from a note 4 to the new s7I was kind of learybut
I love it Fast processingvery responsive
The camera is the best one they have ever had I use this all the time for pics

I have owned many samsung phones going way back to their flip phoneslol
This is my favorite so far
Screen resolution is beautiful
Keyboard is right on with typing and I actually get the right words 99 of the time I love the design if the phone I like the thumb print security feature Ive had the phone now for a couple weeks I have enjoyed it very much The camera is much better that my Note 4 I have only had Samsung phones for many years since I switched from Blackberrys All the phones have worked very well for me I have had issues with battery life with the phones in the past No issues with this one yet Theres plenty to love about the new Galaxy S7 Edge I want to start with the improved water resistance I live in Seattle and this is a must have feature for anyone that lives in the Pacific Northwest Its even good enough for Lil Wayne to pour champagne on it Theres a ton of other features to gawk at as well The first thing I noticed out of the package was how lightweight this phone was The slim design was extremely impressive in comparison to the much bulkier S5 active I was upgrading from Even once I paired the Edge with a shockresistant case it was still very easy to use onehanded Marshmallow handles multitasking flawlessly The edge displays are handy as another way to access apps and information Samsung Pay is easy to use and is one of the best features putting Samsung way ahead of the mobile payment game The screen is gorgeous and any video or graphic is easily brought to life with vivid clarity The camera takes great photos no different than the S5 Active but the camera now takes even better photos in low light The expandable memory card storage is another great feature of this device eliminating the need to constantly clean out your phone or delete apps My only complaint at this point is the wake up function for S Voice It seems to just wake up randomly during conversation even though Im not saying the actual command In addition S Voice is still much slower than some of the other AI platforms out there This is an extremely sleek smart and sexy phone with plenty of good to outweigh the little bit of bad Samsung has created a nearperfect device with the S7 Edge Im an ex windows phone user this phone is great I havent had any issues with power or performance Very well made I would buy it again just for Samsung pay I havent found a single place that takes credit cards that wont take it This phone is powered by the latest software and stunning camera and a Storage to back it all with I would high recommend to others This phone Is great in all aspects BUT I have a few issues with the overheating poor cell signal with frequent dropped calls and SD card popup every time I turn on the screen Which is getting really annoying I hope there will be a fix to all of this because I use this phone for my Business I owned the Note 4 previously to this and had none of these issues and I feel like i downgraded But I will give the S7 Edge some more time and a benefit of the doubt I hope the Note 6 does not have these issues for I plan to Buy it when it comes available 
I check the 
 I would recommend this product to a friend_ NO Because of these issues Otherwise I would say Yes Offer all camera is excellent style is awesomeand size is perfect I LOVE THIS PHONE It is the best phone I have ever had The design is really smooth and easy to handle It takes some getting used to especially since there is no manual BUT once you decode the devices features its pure love With expendable memory wnd the water resistance its everything I wanted in a phone 

Dont every go back from this amazing design I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 the camera is awesome The screen is very crisp and clear Great phone overall Works amazing smooth controls great features and is overall absolutely beautiful I love my edge I upgraded to my current Galaxy S7 Edge from a Galaxy S5 though I got a chance to play around with an S6 The Galaxy S7 appears to be the topoftheline handset of 2016 so far Fairly expensive but well worth the money with the blazing fast processor phenomenal camera and of course the massive battery So far it is without a doubt my favorite Galaxy phone and I cant wait to see whats next I upgraded from an S4 to an S7 Edge
The functionality clarity of pictures and overall performance is awesome It is a bit larger than the S4 but was an easy transition The backorder for colors other than black was disappointing It has a fairly high pricepoint but not having upgraded for a few years it worked out ok for me I would like to see a lower prices option maybe less storage but same functions Just got this device about a month ago and I really like it I had a GS4 before and 
I transitioned to the GS7 seamlessly Samsung never fails to impress Best phone on the market Was disappointed with the lack of IR sensor as my S5 was used frequently to control devices through IRAQ

Systems seems to run slow out of the box compared to my 2 year old S5 This is an awesome device which has a lot of great features Im coming from an iPhone 6 and I had never had a samsumg and now Im in love with it and Im planning to keep buying samsung as long as they keep coming up so also this phone has an awesome design and I love the edge thats one of the reasons I brought this phone The phones overall performance is excellent marred only by one or two small downfalls

Pros extremely fast visually stunning ergonomically designed amazing photo quality outstanding graphics

Cons edge is a bit too sensitive makes it difficult to hold and use screen at the same time finger print reader is a bit quirky

The device works well for my purposes though the edge being so finicky is a bit of an annoyance For someone who plays a lot of games it might become a nuisance That being said I am a previous Note series owner which means that Im used to a lot of screen real estatemaking this adjustment is one that some may not encounter

All things considered I would recommend this product to friends or family The processor is snappy the graphics are secondtonone the camera outstanding The phone itself is a little pricey for something that feels so familiar But the phone offers enough functionality to view it as an upgrade Im really happy with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The battery lasts much longer than my S6 Edge I like the larger size The features are amazing Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge is the best phone it has all you need Waterdust resistant easy to navigate I would never change Samsung Galaxy phones for any other All my family and friends have Samsung Galaxy S6 and S7 edge after I changed to Samsung Galaxy S3 and now I have S7 Edge Upgrade from 6
Excellent overall
Very pleased with performance

Would highly recommend This is by far my best phone I was going to get the Edge but the fact that there is no case that will cover the edge deterred me The battery life is amazing The sleekness is awesome There is nothing I dont like about the S7 I would highly recommend it to anyone that is in search of a new phone I just upgraded to the S7 Edge and the phone is perfect I am a former iPhone user and I must say that the S7 Edge is far ahead of that brand I love my Edge and will never go back to an iPhone I bought this phone as an upgrade from my Note Edge I was looking for a smaller phone than what I had one that didnt have an edge I couldnt stand it my palm would open apps when using with one hand and phone I could use my SD card in After waiting past the s6 Samsung went back in the direction that made them stand apart from Apple even though it still kind of resembles an iPhone around the edges Its fast a huge upgrade from my note Apps load a lot faster on this phone The only thing I dont like is that Samsung still uses TouchWiz There really hasnt been any improvements on that Looks the same as any other Samsung device Went from an S6 to this S7 Battery life is phenomenal and performance is great Of all the Samsung phones Ive owned this is absolutely the best I absolutely love it Good device Great camera and screen resolution Have owned this phone for 2 weeks and i like it so far Awesone phone The phone is great in lots of ways It makes my life more easier at home and also when Im in school its fast performance helps me work faster when I be needing it But the features are just about the same as other phones its nothing special with it but I would recommend this phone This phone is very comfortable to hold it is super fast is extremely light I love everything about it have not found one thing that I do not like about it at the moment I have been highly recommending this phone to everyone I speak to about phones or technology I have actually been recommending this phone over the regular S7 Its such a nice phone I think Im going to get my wife on as she fell in love with herself My last Samsung was the S5 This phone is leaps and bounds better looking than that phone The battery life and fast wireless charging is quite good I highly recommend this phone The Samsung S7 provides an optimal experience with android 60 12 mp camera and the processing power of a modern computer Being able to add more storage again while maintaing a 32GB base model was a great idea I love this phone and as a cell phone rep i recommend this phone to ever customer I didnt think I was gonna like the edge but I really like the cool side features The camera is amazing the display is so clear and the colors are so bright And its so fast too Battery last longer than the s6 My son has used Galaxy phones for years but this is my first one It helps that he has the same phone so he can be my tutor Honestly I havent needed much help The S7 is super easy to use and the camera is fantastic Im going on vacation next week and I cant wait to see the beautiful photos I take with my new phone I also appreciate how long the battery lasts Thats a huge bonus I love this phone except I have been having battery life drain  also I am unintentionally opening apps that are too close to the edge of screen These issues can easily be addressed via software update

I love the always on display and the wireless quick charging It also has a beautiful display Switched from the Galaxy S4 and never want to look back Best phone Ive ever owned Everything is great about the phone except for two big things

One is that it seems to have a defect with the micro sd card slot such that it constantly tells me about the card being inserted It seems minor but its really really annoying

Second is that clearing notifications is painfully slow Like 15 seconds slow This paired with the constant reappearance of the micro sd card notification means I am irritated about it all the time I got the phone 2 weeks ago and Im considering returning it or exchanging it for another Maybe its just a bug in the phone I have

Either way Im regretting the upgrade so far This phone is amazing It is everything the reviews said and more Great display great sound and picture My only problem would be that the battery is not as good as they say The camera is awesome I cant believe how clear the pictures come out I really like the battery life of this product camera quality is superior compared to any other smart phone this feature makes othersense very envious Samsung phones are always high quality and never disappoint  I love my new phoneI am 62 and this phone is so easy to use and has such great features that even I can use themI wouldnt trade it for anything Best screen so bight and vibrant Screen is very responsive to touch sometimes a little too much I like the edge screen takes a little getting use to if you are a one hand user Over all awesome phone This phone has great features and theyre easy to learn I have had no trouble learning how to use this phone its been great Lighting fast compared to the S5 that we had Added the Otter box case to it and it fits so well Happy Happy Happy HANDS DOWN THE BEST DEVICE OUT THERE WHAT MORE CAN I SAY My Edge 7 is the nicest looking and acting phone Ive ever owned Im still learning to use its many features I thought that I would miss the stylus from my Galaxy note but I dont The memo app negates the need for a stylus I like that Samsung has an easily navigable support app that I can use to answer my own questions without having to call someone I also receive updates on the health status of my phone warning me when I could be using more efficient options The phone seamlessly connected with my car and allows me to read texts hands free while driving If it couldnt do that it would be a deal breaker I like the colorful edge display though I think it eats more battery time than its worth Fortunately the Edge 7 recharges quickly and wirelessly even in my car I dont have any problem with the speaker sound system that some others have complained about Overall I think its a great phone though a tad bit pricey The features are fantastic easy to find and easy to use Switched from iPhone 5s to s7 edge and so far has been the best phone Ive ever had Great features awesome camera and design is incredible This phone has been excellent from day one however it took some getting used to The slim edges and the lack of a thick bezel near the soft keys made it difficult to hold without accidentally causing taps It took about a week to adjust and I dont have any issues now The phone has handled everything Ive thrown at it with ease After owning many IPhones I made the decision to purchase a S7 Best decision I ever made The S7 is faster has many more features as well as better features I can even do work on this phone And the best part is I no longer have to deal with Itunes Some obvious positives Perfect hardware design and build Waterproof really works I tried Great hand feel Marshmallow 60 is definitely the best Android yet

But    coming from Windows Phone there are some areas of Android software that simply are lagging behind
1 Cortana Yes its available on Android but not the deep level of integration On WM10 its contextual in almost every screen accessible from every screen Being able to discuss text messagesetc is something I miss very much when driving Perhaps there is a way for Google now to dictate and respond to my texts I just dont know how to do it

2 Icons I personally hate icons which is why I moved from the iOS platform several years ago That structure is simply archaic I love the Android widgets and I which every app had them If every app had them Id be happy But having to sortscrolletc for little icons is passe at this point

3 Backup features WM can basically completely replicate the entire phone on a new phone without issue Android   not so much WM restore features are complete which means its better than iOS 

4 Windows 10 text integration Being able to text from Cortana on my laptop is surprisingly handy I miss that

5 Android integration with Androids Outlook app Its not good Cortana would present to me all my Outlook and Google Calendar appointmentsevents Android only presents the google calendar events which makes it incomplete and useless 

6 Design consistency throughout apps Black backgrounds are the standard user selectable for readability etc Androids schema is all over albeit largely selected by the apps themselves Either way I dont like looking at black letters on light backgrounds

7 Camera The Samsung S7 images appear a bit warped Its strange The camera on my old 1520 and newer 950xl were superior The 950xl camera in particular was incredible That said the S7s camera speed is amazing and superior to the 950xl

So perhaps youre wondering why I have an S7 instead of the 950xl The S7 with Android is better because

1 App selection and maturity Im primarily a business phone user and I need strong versions of WhatsApp Salesforce Concur and NetSuite WM has very weak iterations of these apps

2 Battery life Despite hanging with the 950xl through several software and firmware upgrades the batter life is absolutely terrible Battery life on my 1520 with WM81 was incredible  10 hours  of heavy use The 950xl gave me maybe 23 of heavy use Terrible The S7 in regular battery saving mode gets me back to the 10 hours I need

3 Speed The 950xl was painfully slow in some areas Sometimes it would take 30 thirty seconds for the text message list to be populated I took it in scrubbed the software etc Within a few days texting lag would become untenable Camera speed was also inferior to current standards

Thats it  good luck Galaxy S7 Edge here came off of an S5 Was a bit fearful of the increased size of the S7 but found that its easy to hold and feels good in my hand The scree is beautiful performance is fast and the edge feature is pretty neat One issue with the edge is that I have an app that requires clicking in the upper right corner and its tricky as the menu to click falls right on the edge Other than that its an outstanding piece Its simply beautiful I love love it thanks Samsung I preordered the S7 thru ATT to get the Virtual Reality headset After using it for about a week it would no longer come on The ATT store was shocked as they had no know issues on this model They replaced it as a DOA so it wasnt a big deal I am sure there was some kind of glitch however I was taken care of Ive had my s7 edge about a month and so far no glitching everything goes so smooth no cutting in and out while talking great pictures sounds good just overall good quality so far And by far the best Samsung or galaxy Ive ever owned The phone has a very sleek look and feels great in the hand Its very light and for lack of a better word its very pretty The interface is very friendly even if your a first time galaxy owner if you are youll never buy another brand after tying this phone Call quality is very impressive speed is lighting fast camera is out of this world For the first time my wife put down her DSL and have been taking tons of photos with the phone Overall a must have for anyone that wants an awesome phone I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S4 and thought it was a pretty nice phone Well the Galaxy S7 is a huge upgrade both on the outside of the phone and what is loaded on the phone The buttons on the phone feel better when clicked than the S4 especially the home button The S7 also has a lot of great features and it runs really fast when loading apps The camera on the phone is also a big improvement over my previous S4 I was never really all that happy with the camera on the S4 but the S7 has an amazing camera that takes crystal clear pictures I like that there are different filters you can use with the camera and you can even download more from the Galaxy App Store I also like that the phone has a built in fingerprint scanner although I havent actually tried it yet It is nice to know that it is available if I decided to use it As far as the actual phone goes it sounds pretty good Ive been able to hear calls well and the people on the other end can hear me well Overall this is the best phone Ive ever owned and Ive had several different smartphones over the years I highly recommend this phone to everyone I have used another Android provider for a long time Im much more impressed with the design and performance of the Samsung S7 Samsung has raised the bar with this phone if you are looking for a great phone look no further I am still learning all I can do with this phone The possible so are endless The Samsung Galaxy so far  Some great new features  especially like new fingerprint unlock feature and the new camera is great Wanted to upgrade my phone for a long time but waited until the perfect storm of features came together and it has Waterproof with 200gb memory VR capability and best fasted camera lens did it for me Never looking back Finally back to being able to expand the memory with a micro SD card I was quick to seek a way to upgrade to this phone Not only that but with the other improvements to the phonend performance and response is always quick The only time I suffer a long loading wait is due to myour WiFi connection and never the phone 
And dont get me started on battery life With my Galaxy s6 I used to have to charge it twice a day if I wanted to still use certain apps for an extended time and still have battery life from start to finish when not using the power saving features With the s7 my battery life is almost 3 times to I charge it for maybe 30 min with the fast charger and Ive got power all the way through the day and then some its amazing
I tell all my friends who love Android phones to check out the Samsung Galaxy S7 and even use my phone to give them a look at some of the cool features like the simple easy way one can take selfesteem by simply tabbing the heart rate monitor located next to the rear camera How easy is that The S7 is slick and beautiful Its battery life is amazing and everything loads fast Ive always been a fan of Samsung phones but they never felt complete They were always missing something but this phone nothing is missing All of the features are very useful it has a great camera fantastic design great battery life and an excellent camera I love this phone and everything about it Great phone Love galaxy phones Has great definition and great screens size The screen is just the right size not to big and not to small The new galaxy s7 has made my life great again They brought back the waterproof and SD card slot that was missing on the 6 Although the battery can not be removed still bums me out but its still an incredible phone This phone has met all my expectations I have already recommended this phone Tommy friends and family I was truly amazed by how long of a battery life span it has with my other phone I couldnt even go half a day without charging it But now I can go all day without charging it and with me using my phone very much for almost everything My phone will not run outta battery I absolutely love it Samsung truly outdid themselves with the Galaxy Edge 7 I cant imagine having any other phone right now The phone is awesome Works just like Id expect I do have two problems Id like to see the wireless charger be included with the phone The ear buds are garbage  Very poor design They dont stay in your ear and are not comfortable Go get some aftermarket ones Phone has a beautiful display its a very fast phone jumping in and out of apps Love that its water resistant again and support for micro sd was brought back Very feature rich phone very happy with my new phone camera is great battery life is almost 2 days with moderate use hope it continues to be this strong Ive been using the Galaxy series of 4 yrs now And I love Samsung products However I was a bit disappointed around the glass screen I thought this was a strong product but I didnt realize its prone to some scratches The phone was with me in my pocket I had my keys in there Just 2 And I got a scratch right in the center I never hdthat issue with the S4 Which I LOVE I do like the camera and battery life The Smemo on S4 did not sync due to some reason Rest is fine I have small hands so a tad bit smaller phone would help me operate one hand
Speaker on S4 is much better I feel
Overall a great product This phone is amazing Process very quickly and makes life easy I love this phone the look the feel everything I upgraded from an Galaxy S5 and I am extremely happy I did the over all programming in this phone is better Sure it replaced an S4 Ive got with a twoyear contract so there were two updates in between
Slimmer brighter screen very clear voice on every phone call
Easier to navigate take pictures back and front
Above all the additional upto 128GB SD memory makes it a clear substitute for all my tablets and computers
Love it so far This is my second Samsung Galaxy I went from a Galaxy S4 to a S7 Talk about a big change I absolutely love the new features and in my opinion Galaxys will always be better than iPhones But besides from that the camera is one of the best improvements All of my friends envy how high quality the camera is The pictures are crystal clear and the ability to adjust lighting is phenomenal The edge design looks great but is very vulnerable to breakage I was told the gorilla glass would be adequate protection yet I dropped it once from waist height and the gorilla glass shattered I am disappointed in that aspect and would have just gone with the S7 had I known Same great phone but with the improvement of being able to add memory again is priceless now I wont run out of space Love the design of the Samsung s7 its beautiful contrast and superb camera features from battery life to water proof I love this phone works fast and has a solid platform The overall design of this phone is well built Its sleek features make it a crowd pleaser and its smooth running processor is always a great job I really do love the chance to review this phone for others to enjoy it as much a I have My phone I cant say enough About It meets my expectations exceedingly This is a premium quality phone with all of the bells and whistles The slide in menu from the side is great  the launcher is the best Ive worked with on Android I have all the features I liked from the Note Series while finding the most comfortable size Great job team I was so happy Samsung brought back water resistant and expandable memory back to the S7 I was considering other phones before these features were returned The battery life is improved and the quick charging feature is an added bonus The camera is magnificent and the processor is extremely fast I highly recommend this phone I was a fan of the S5 for a few years stubbornly refusing to upgrade Once I heard about researched and tried out an S7 I was hooked The performance is astonishing extremely quick easy multitasking no freezing The camera is phenomenal with amazingly fast focusing and incredible quality and the Quick Launch feature is perfect for snapping photos in seconds 

I was pleased to see that Samsung brought back the expandable microSD storage and with Lollipop you can incorporate up to 200GB into the phones memory Along with the builtin dust and water resistance this phones design is nearly impossible to beat

My only complaint is that due to the slight curvature of the edges of the screen on the standard S7 not the Edge there are no available screen protectors that cover the entirety of the screen All available products stop one or two millimeters short on each side though since the screen itself is made of Gorilla Glass and Im paying for insurance Im not too worried Full disclosure this was not my first choice of phone My first choice of phone ended up being returned This was due to an ongoing WIFi issue that was seemed consistent throughout the product With the being said onto my review

The ease of setup is always spot on Bump it next to another Android smart phone and you are done As for as customization the themes are excellent It is great to not to be tied down to whatever stock is provided 

The processor and screen resolution are excellent for this phone The moves through taxes with ease and does not bog down Videos are crisp and very easy to view

And a pleasant addition with the Edge expendable memory It is awesome that the memory card has came back This is great since I like to download music to my phone I will be getting a large memory card to take advantage of this storage

The edge feeds are a great touch It s nice to not have to unlock the phone and get news briefing check sports scores or check messages

All in all I am very satisfied with this phone My only complaint is the speaker location One single speaker on the bottom is not a great plan It would have been nice to have 2 speakers on the phone itself But I generally listen with my headphones so I do not notice the speaker all that much Ok so this was an upgrade from a s4 Thats a large jump This phone is everything I wanted Its super fast powerful had removable memory and I think the best part ITS WATERPROOF
If your on the edge of getting this phone DO IT you wont be let down Galaxy S7 Edge is more than I expected and handy to explore various apps as well My S7 edge is by far the best phone I have ever owned Everyone who sees it remarks on how bright and vibrant the screen is Best of all it has by far the best battery life of any smart phone I have had despite the great display and super fast processor I have always owned Samsung Galaxy phones and was always pleased with them but the s7 edge goes well beyond my expectations I highly recommend this phone Ive never had a phone the works so smoothly The apps and everything Im able to do on the phone both for personal and for work are wonderful 
Ive recommend this phone to several people Ive had a galaxy since the galaxy captivate and this is by far the best one yet Ive been in the note family for awhile but looking at these features I had to make the switch The edge menu is awesome and the speed and battery life are great Cant wait to get the gear vr as well Overall this is a great device awesome design and my favorite phone yet I had the phone for all but 5 days before it froze up Couldnt do anything with it had to wait for the battery to die for it to work properly again Since then it hasnt froze up yet The phone heats up if you use it for too long Battery life seems more important than ever these days I was so pleased to hear that the S7 had a stronger longer lasting battery Now I dont have to worry if the battery is going to give out by the end of the day 
Some of the new features of the S7 are so handy too Like the date and time on the screen when the phone is not active 
This is the best phone I have had without a doubt O yea moving my pictures applications documents and other things could not have been easier I was up and running with all my stuff in minutes Best startup EVER Fast performance and is very sleek Its thin and light and the graphics are awesome I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Active The S7 provides many of the features that differentiated the Active series without the loss of features The fingerprint unlock is a great addition Also find the 32G is nice for some more apps The curved glass is a unique feature that I like and am still getting used to Absolutely in love with this phone my favorite one The way the screen has a slight curve the awesome camera and the great performance make this the best Ive had ITS ALSO WAY BETTER THAN AN IPHONE The camera is the best available Very easy to use I absolutely loved my Galaxy S5 and held onto it until the S7 premiered and I am so glad I made the switch Its platform is faster the design is nicer and its just improved all the way around Not quite as expected but growing on me I thought at first it wasnt much different than my Galaxy s5but as the weeks go onIm finding out more and more I have big fingers and the keyboard makes it easier for me to type my emails and text Even better when you flip the phone on it side you have more space between the keys to type and make less mistakes as your typing your emails or text 
The camera is to me the best feature this phone has I took a few videos after the sun when down and the quality of the video was surprisingly well
Overall if you are thinking of getting this phone i think you should get it without a doubt you wont regret it The Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best phone ever built Samsung just keeps upping the bar for their competition There isnt one thing I would change about this phone Ive owned many samsung phones going all the back to my first one the Galaxy Skyrocket Ive had all the Notes except the 5because they took the SD card away and this one is definitely my favorite The phone has everything you need and some not to mention how beautiful it is The only reason I didnt give it five stars for the features is because ATT removes some of the features that originally came with the phone Love this phone Battery last a long time Its packed full of awesome features Extremely powerful and does not get to hot when in heavy use I love all the new features and the camera is great The fact that you can put the S7 in water is amazing I use is in the shower all the time and my phone is still kicking Great phone picture quality is amazing as well Over all I love my phone This phone is the best smartphone out there right now hands down Ive owned each of the main Gakaxy series like phones since the S4 and I can tell you that Samsung has really outdone themselves this time with the S7 Edge Great phone Easy to use and set up Super fast processing speed Better than my galaxy s5 Great pic resolution This is a great phone Lots of the normal Samsung bloat but a great phone Camera works great processor has more than enough power Recommended it to everyone who asked about it I owned the Galaxy s6 edge which I liked except for the battery life With the s7 I can go 2 days on 1 charge Great phone Samsung nailed it with this phone Its smaller and Sleeker than the S6 and the clarity of the screen is amazing And that clarity is transfered to the pictures the camera is fantastic and now you can take pictures under 5 feet of water SICK I also got the wireless charger which works great with the S7 and S6 Definitely a great value Get you one There is really only one thing I dont care for and that is it slippery workout a case Great upside with small downside Fast and practical with elegance Although it turns on Im my pocket and makes calls as well as turns on apps like ordering and Uber on its on Very good phone though The functionality of the phone is great It is very fast and has great new features The only disappointment is that the screen can get scratched easily My screen scratched in less than 2 weeks I have had a previous phone for 2 years treating it just the same and never gotten a single scratch This phone now has several deep scratches in the middle of the screen I am definitely getting a screen protector Works fine for me Just like my 101 tablet but you can make calls and surf on the go Battey doesnt last long Have to charge daily even with some features turned off The new S7 is everything I wanted in a smartphone and more I love the performance battery life speed to charge Oh and the IP 68 is great if you have to work outside like me and dont have to worry about getting your phone wet Thank you Samsung for yet another great product Lighter than the S5 Screen size is great Nice sharp crisp images Performance is good as well Overall I would say this is Samsungs best phone yet Its processing speed far surpasses previous models Its ease of connectivity with other devises is smooth and easy It has a battery that lasts all day even with steady use The design is sleek making it not only useful but also nice to look at Its slim design makes it possible to put a protective case on it and not make it bulky However the curved glass screen has made it difficult to find a screen protector that will not lift up around the edges The voice recognition and keyboard swipe have both improved drastically but I feel the keyboard swipe still has some room to grow The 32gb built in capacity and its expandability through a micro SD card blows other fruit inspired phones out of the water Its OS now glides and I love the option of grouping short cuts Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone who wanted a good looking phone that also operated smoothly quickly and performed beyond expectations The camera is excellent probably the best phone camera yet and I have had several of the Galaxy phones over the years The battery life is long lasting and it charges quickly Samsung has come along way The feel of the S7 Edge is lightweight but durable Best phone ever Does everything I want it to  review is too short I really liked the phone but while on some calls in different locations like my office at home in the back area of a store or in my car I have been having issues with either the call dropping or the person can not always hear me or the opposite So I took my first phone back to the store to have it replaced within the first two weeks of purchase hoping it was just that device but it appears to be happening with my second device as well is anyone else having that issue or know what I can do to keep that from happening thanks I traded up from the s5 active which was a great phone I spend a lot of time on the water in the summer and in the snow in the winter I needed a phone to stand up to the water The active was great but you had to worry about the port covers for it to be waterproof With the edge not only does it look better take better pictures and feel more comfortable to hold and use you do not have to worry about any port covers for the waterproof part This has been an amazing phone As always Samsung has made another great product with the s7 The display is amazing and the sound is awesome The improved camera has made taking pictures more enjoyable This is my 3rd Samsung phone There products are always excellent quality and easy to use More like the universe S7 Edge The Hands down hands up hands on and cant keep my hands off best phone ever Period cantkeepmyhandsoffmyS7 This phone has exceeded all expectations Its the perfect size and does everything I need it to with power to spare Its a beautiful phone and I am proud to own it I show it to everyone  This phone together with android 6 is wonderful I have it in my hand doing something with it all the time I love the fast wireless charging and the long lasting battery And bringing the SD card back was about the best thing Samsung could of done The Camera is amazing it is everything a good camera should be Great phone and camera is much better than my S5 phone Would recommend this to friends Have had the phone for just about 3 weeks now I am very much enjoying it I known I have so much to learn yet about its features Battery life seems to be pretty good thus far I am charging phone about once every day and a half I believe and it still not completely dead at that point My only complaint was I felt the need for a case immediately as its case on backside is very slick No other complaints thus far It seems very responsive and I love it I love how easy it is to use and how it has hints such as how to do a screenshot that pop up as you are first learning playing with your new phone I have found that I am having trouble downloadingsaving pictures from websites and especially tumblr I really dont like the fact that the glass screen protectors dont fit but hopefully they will fix that soon best phone ever use it to monitor security cameras picture is crystal clear I noticed problem with the phone freezing quite a bit At times it reboots itself  This is QUITE annoying when I have 2 stop walking and restart whatever music I am listening to It makes takes me off my rhythm on the way to where ever I happen to be going at the time Im hoping its not the phone since I really like it I heard it cud be operating system Marshmallow This phone is as close to perfection as you can get I will just start with switching over to it The transfer from my Galaxy S6 Edge went flawlessly I had my S7 Edge up and running in no time with all of my old content

Like all of the reviews out there say this is a great looking phone The screen is nice and bright The form is wonderful I hated to put a case on it but I needed a bit of extra grip since all of this good looking glass can get real slick The size is good and doesnt creep to much into phablet territory It is almost there but not quite 

I wont say too much about the software since it is Marshmallow with just a hint of tweaking by Samsung Gone are the days of a heavy TouchWiz interface

The camera is improved on this phone Low light pictures are better just like the advertising says 

The return of the SD card is welcome Lastly the big battery in this phone is great I can easily make it more than 24 hours between charges even with a moderate amount of use First the battery on this phone is like no other I easily get through the day without having to charge it Second expandable storage is the reason I turned in my s5 for the s7 edge and I havent looked back Overall phone is a powerhouse and is the best out there I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge from the Samsung Galaxy s4 and I could not be happier Samsung has made a smart decision by bringing back the extra storage while keeping the beautiful sleek design on the edges Battery life is phenomenal Very rarely get below 50 in a day Feels great holding it Fingerprint works every time Would encourage everyone to consider this phone Switched from the s5 wow such an improvement love this phone Very nice phone just a little big I do like the one hand feature i loveit the camera is fantastic  front and rear Where do I start The camera is amazing Photographs I am able to acquire with the camera are stunning crystal clear and magnificent even in low light The number of camera options available means you can always get the best shot A Pro option allows you to have full control setting ISO shutter speed even white balance You can be as creative and in control as you wish

I personally like the fingerprint security option where you can use your thumb or fingerprint to unlock the phone Ive used this option on previous phones and it never worked well but S7 nails it An added feature is that you can set certain areas like home or work where it wont ask you to unlock the device Very convenient 

Physically the edge is beautiful 

I love this S7 The smartphone to beat Ive been a Galaxy owners since the Galaxy S1 Ive had the pleasure of also owning a Galaxy S3 S5 Galaxy Tab 8 and now the S7 Edge I also converted my wife from iPhone to a Galaxy Note 2 and then Note 4 There is simply not enough to that can be said about this new phone The EDGE does not simply apply to the new screen features but to the point of the envelope that this phone pushes It is a beautiful and vastly capable piece of technology that has improved my life as it has many times before Thank you Samsung I am so proud to be a Galaxy products owner Every year I wonder how they are going to top themselves and they do it every single time The best smartphonesmartphone out there right right now Since having S7 I have been having fun with all of the new features It is also fun using the Oculus VR for the firsttime I would recommend this to friends and anyone looking for a new Smart phone Great design super fast lasting battery so many options and features Highly recommended I love the phone but I have been having issues connecting to WiFi But what else would you expect 

So far I have owned an S3 mini S4  S5 
Decided to give iPhone 6S a try 
What a massive mistake 
Paid a ton of  to get out of that phone and into S7 
Worth every penny Okay so I work with cell phones all day every day I get to see and play with the latest and greatest phones Ive had an iPhone since like 2009 Yeah a long time I made a switch to this phone and was a little scared There is was nothing to be scared of This phone is fast and dependable The battery life is amazing I usually have the phone off the charger from 7 am to midnight most days It still has some charge at that time The camera is absolutely amazing Best one i have seen on a phone so far Expandabale memory to 200 GB get out of here Thats a lot of storage but with the special adapter you have endless possibilities for storage You will not be upset with this phone I have had all the galaxy phones and have never had a break or scratch This phone the back of the phone shattered on day 1 and over the next few days the front or the screen is getting scratched up I am not sure why Galaxy S6 was much better and more durable The features advertised met my expectations Im still getting used to having the edge feature I like how I can move the tab so I dont accidentally open it Wish it had more apps and stuff though The battery lasts so long The speakers on my s4 active were a bit better but I cant complain too much with this one I love my S7 It runs smoothly and all the new features have been a blessing I enjoy the ability to disable all the bloatware that comes installed My only issue is that the regular S7 screen is still slightly curved at the edges of the screen This is only a very minor issue since I use a glass screen protector Despite the screen protector being flexible it doesnt quite stay down around the edge of the screen Because of the case I have on my phone its a barely noticed issue This phone has some great features Only problem Ive had is dropping calls in spots where my s5 had no problems Ive always been a fan of the galaxy phones This by far is the best one Ive had The camera is awesome and I love the look and feel of it I was anxious to try the new S7 after running out of memory frequently on my S5 I spent hours online and at the local store trying to get it to make calls I was told I was not the only one having trouble After leaving it at the store for a couple of days it was finally fixed I have not had the phone long enough to evaluate the new features I have tried Samsung Pay and it worked great I am still working at getting all my old accounts set up on the S7 I think it will end up being a great phone Coming from the HTC one this is a nice upgrade Its fast hasnt freezed yet and takes nice photos The overall size and design of the phone is great also has neat features The only thing is the screen randomly lights up throughout the day Ive turned the always on feature off Im not sure if its a glitch or what Also I hate how the tempered glass cover fits the screen because of the slightly curved edges but Ive learned to ignore it I have horses so the water and dust resistance is a huge bonus Definitely glad I preordered I am entirely satisfied with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Before I bought it I went to many different stores and tried many phones I have no doubts that the new Galaxy S7 Edge is the BEST phone in the market overall The battery lasts all day the screen is PERFECT the camera is sensational the design is glamorous and it is WATERPROOF I have taken showers and baths with my phone and have also swum with it I am definitely in love with my phone and would recommend it to everyone For a long time I was a die hard iPhone user until the iPhone 6 was revealed I decided to throw caution to the wind and try android I started with a refurbished galaxy s5 and thats when I fell in love with not just android but Samsung Galaxy phones

Ive recently updated to a galaxy s7 edge and it might just be the best decision I ever made The camera is Amazing Im not a big photo guy but I love taking pictures and tweaking them afterwards Being able to say smile And having the phone take a picture is sweet

The edge features are very cool very easy to use and easy to personalize At first I wasnt sure if I would use them but I do all day long Speaking of the edge screen it is beautiful I dont know if the phone has some sort of acceleration hardware for videos or what but it makes older movies look Bluray quality

I could go on and on I spend a lot of time digging around in the phone finding new features but let me end with one that I love I play a lot of games and Ive felt the phone start to get warm but then it cools off I read about the water cooling system for the s7 but when I felt it in action I was blown away Great phone with lots of features The camera is the best I have had with a phone takes awesome pictures SDcard was nice to have back Traded in my S4 for the S7 Many applications have changed The updates have made the operations very smooth Im very happy with the new phone It has worked great for me This phone is amazing Its the best I have ever had All of the issues I had with my a Note 4 with respect to lag touch wise and speed have been addressed The edge and its functions are great and I would recommend this phone above all others The 7 edge is a great phone More memory better camera longer battery life I used the three the four and the five and out of them all this is the easiest to use I have been able to find things without asking my husband for help  Very easy to use and I just wish it came in more colors Ive been with galaxy for years only gets better and better but my s7 edge is way more than expected and i am very pleased with it keep up the amazing work Very fast and nice to hold I just wish it would have the edge like the note edge I was a Galaxy S5 user for the past two years and I loved it But over time I felt the crunch of space constraints battery life and just was ready for some new features Well Samsung did not disappoint The weight and feel of the phone is lighter and nicer than I had expected The always on display means that I can finally remember the date just with a glance The camera is just flat out amazing Pictures with great exposure color and detail I just love it Feels good and is big Nice waterproof feature and is fast I love this phone It has awesome camera It has removable memory again And its water resistance I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family members The Samsung products are getting better and better I appreciate everything samsung have done with their products Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Cant wait until the next phone they come out with I love samsung galaxy and all their products CouldMt ask for a better phone the edge features are great the battery life is a definite upgrade from the s6 Having used this phone for about two weeks now I can easily say Im glad I upgraded from my S5 to the S7 I wasnt too impressed with the S6 for its lack of features that the S5 had  namely waterdust resistance expandable storage and a removable battery so when rumors began to surface about the S7 bringing back the waterdust resistance and the SD card slot my first thought was that if they were true I would upgrade as soon as it came out Sure enough the conference came and I eagerly awaited the day the S7 was released I bought the phone the day after it was released and I have to say Im still impressed by it every single day

All the features I love are much improved the phone feels great in the hands quite slippery though the buttons feel very solid the camera and home button now much more flush with the body the screen looks absolutely incredible So much so I had to add two pros for it This has to be the best display Ive laid eyes on in a phone The battery life is pretty much what Ive come to expect since Im pretty heavy on my usage I end up having to charge it every night but its always enough to get me through the day If its not ultra powersaving mode to the rescue The fast charging also usually means that I can plug it up finish what Im doing before bed and by the time Im ready to sleep its already charged The performance is topnotch much faster than even my S5 was out of the box The alwayson screen is very nice for having the phone sitting out on the desk or table  very useful for quickly checking the time or glancing at the calendar depending on the selected setting The cameras are still impressive too The S7 has the best frontfacing camera Ive seen on a smart phone and the rear camera despite the drop in megapixels is still just as good as the S5 or S6 were The only complaint I really have about the camera is the lowlight performance still isnt there Im not a camera expert but compared to a few other phones out there theres still just a little bit of room for improvement  the colors arent as sharp and any light in the shot tends to blur together in splotches without every focusing enough

Aside from the lowlight performance of the camera the only faults I can find with the phone are the speaker the slipperiness and one detail about the design The speaker isnt the clearest it gets overwhelmed by too many sounds too easily music sounds a bit muddy through it and sounds just dont seem to sound as clear as they could This is really a minor problem though because the water resistance is to blame here and Im more than happy to make this trade 98 of the time if I do listen to music or watch videos Im using my headphones anyway so this is really a minor issue The biggest problem I have with this phone comes from just how good it looks The glass and metal look is definitely a premium design and it looks and feels absolutely awesome but this thing is so slippery it almost scares me to take it out of my pocket sometimes I remember one reviewer saying that the phone had slipped out of their pocket while they were driving I scoffed a little bit and credited that to whatever pants they must have been wearing I can now say they werent lying  the same thing has happened to me twice now once while driving to work the other while driving to campus Both are pretty short drives but it was obviously long enough for the phone to decide it didnt want to be there anymore Lastly the only criticism of the design I have is that the S series is starting to go down the path of following a design of a certain other popular phone line This isnt the only phone that has done so there are several others which have also done so but Samsungs designs have always been great and its a shame to see this phone beginning to take on that familiar shape That being said the subtle details of the design the slightly curved edges around the front and back being my favorite really shine here and its only in combination with these other two things that I have to rate it 4 stars instead of 5

I usually grow tired of phones pretty quickly but I have a feeling Im going to be loving this phone well past the release of the next in the S series and I look forward to the many months to come of using the S7 I went from Galaxy Note 4 to the Galaxy S7 very nice transition I like the weight of the phone and the color Best upgrade Ive ever made I loved my Note 3 but the S7 Edge blows it out of the water I cant wait to upgrade to the Note Edge when it comes out The Samsung S7 is a great followon to my old S4 The screen is as clear and crisp as a glossy picture The features are much easier to access with fewer steps so I spend less time getting to what I need I really love the fingerprint security feature Not having to enter a passcode every time you want to do something on your smartphone is just so convenient And the camera what a breeze and really great pictures I wont need my old digital camera anymore because the pictures are so good I cannot tell the difference At home with my WIFI the internet access speed is so good I find myself using the phone as much as my laptop Lastly the power saving features allow me to forget to charge my phone and still have power for the next day The camera has great new features on my phone I love them I have long been a fan of Android platform especially the Samsung Galaxy S series phones When it comes to features The S7 Edge does not disappoint From the moment I purchased my S7 Edge I could tell I made the right choice of devices With one cable and a few taps of the screen all the data from my old phone was transferred to my new phone ALL of it The ability to pair with my other devices Including my newly acquired Gear S2 seriously impressed me Every time I use my S7 I continue to be impressed I made the right choice All is good but battery gets HOT and phone feels HOT

Whats app has frozen couple of times I love the design and features but I always lose service for some reason And some of the apps like Spotify that worked great with my s5 keeps on crashing or stops playing until I go back on the app So far the best phone I own  I think this has everything a phone needs to have to satisfied customers like me  Where to start Ill start bye saying this has to be one of the best Galaxys to date with a solid feel an unbeatable display and the sd card is back and better than ever This is my first edge and I have to say I love it and I am most happy that Samsung went the other way and made the s7 a bit thicker than thinner The camera is just mind blowing the auto focus is so fast youll never miss a special moment again So as much as I wish the 7 had a removable battery it makes up for it with fast charging and the fact that I can go all day using it heavily with location and bluetooth on for up to 14 to 24hrs Samsung you did a great job and I totally recommend the Galaxy S7 edge to anyone Overall it is a really good phone Great screen great camera and a pretty good battery I love that an SD card and water proofing is back My only small complaint is I would have liked to see dual speakers Clean and crisp display screen Colors are deep and rich Very thin and lightweight but sturdy build Im on phone number 2 I wake up to a screen on my phone that says no SIM card inserted I cant make calls or receive calls text Etc I need to restart my phone sometimes once sometimes two or three more times since I was within my 14 days I was able to get a new phone I am now having the same problem all over again I have loved every galaxy but this one so far is my favorite The battery life is amazing and the camera is one of the best Nice phone good to charge excellent built speaker durable I sell phones for a living I had my S4 for many years and always waited to get a new phone Once the S6 came out I was hesistant to think about upgrading because my S4 had been great But when the S7 came out I was amazed and excited I preordered the day they were open to preorder I love the water resistant feature Which I tested by accident with one of newborns in the bathtub The added memory card capability which I store tons of family photos and music on I just love my phone We love our new Samsung Galaxy S7s They are easy to use and take great pictures I was born to use samsung smart phones and this phone was designed just for me   It predicts my next move its almost funny It is so ahead of my technological needs  I have to work hard to challenge it on a daily basis SAMSUNG has done a great job on the Galaxy S7 I am very satisfied and would recommend you to give it a try all you need is 2hours to let it become a part of you Love all the features that my previous phone didnt have I love the set up Easy and simple but still a lot of room for personalization Love the side bar and quick key functions Great camera and awesome quality There are only thing two things Im not crazy about One the phone has the display that is always on the time but sometimes it freezes on it The other thing is due to the shape of the edge and the phone case it causes for the screen protected to keep getting pulled up and comes loose I love the new Galaxy 7 Ive really connected with it and played with more of the functions than the other Samsung phones Ive had Its been great Theres only one o thing thats bothering me and I tight it was just my old phone Samsung S5 but its happening with this phone too Sometimes my messages cant send whether on wifi or not So while someone is waiting for an answer my answer is waiting to be sent Its quite frustrating I find that as I look at this phone on line it does not have all the same features as the ones online Im loving the S7 so far The Fast Charge is really the feature I cant get enough of Full charge in an hour Yes please So I just gave up my note 3 These new features are a big jump for me I like how they took out unnecessary apps and lets you download them instead So you actually start out with a clean system Quick camera snaps and the resolution is amazing I can zoom close snap and it is still close to clear The screen a finger print magnet which ones are not But easy clean Waterproof Ive seen it tested will not attempt to do it on mine yes Im a chicken I went from a Samsung SIII to S4 to an S5 and now the S7 edge I skipped the S6 because of non expandable memory I have truly seen the growth in technology with this series of Samsung phones It would be silly to say its the best Galaxy ever because it is supposed to be But it is I am still finding cool features to play with A phone this sexy and smart shouldnt be legal Game changer No game over all other phones Its like the beautiful woman that teaches physics at MIT with beauty and brains Im disappointed in a few of the features S5 camera had touch anywhere to shoot this one dont  Mail options not the best either May take awhile to get used to My only problem with it is that it doesnt have a removable battery I do like how the upgradable storage came back That was my one reason why I didnt buy the S6 Other than that the phone is great The camera is amazing especially on the screen I got the edge only because the screen was a little bigger than the normal S7 Didnt care for the edge feature especially since it doesnt do much in the first place Overall great phone though Just dont go trying to be iPhone again like you did with the S6Keep being the Samsung Galaxy Ive known and stayed loyal to So I got the S7 Edge the day it came out and have loved it ever since A great phone much better than the iPhone faster apps internet and the Samsung pay works everywhere unlike Apple pay I had the s5 and up graded I was hopeing they would bring back the sd card and give the phone more internal memory I am happy with the s7 Great job I love my new Samsung Galaxy 7 Edgeit is so slick and is amazing I love it and would recommend it to everyone There is not a better phone on the market The screen is much more sensitive than my s5 It reacts even when my finger hovers but doesnt actually touch the screen Also Ive had issues with the screen going black  before and after I dropped it Once I dropped it the screen cracked and have had nothing but issues with my carrier Apparently my warranty is now voided High recommendation  get a great case that especially protects the screen Also get the insurance The best samsung phone ever this is a treat to use with amazing display and ultrafast performance 
Samsung has showed us why is it the No 1 smartphone manufacturer Love everything about the Galaxy S7 especially the Samsung apps The battery does not last as long as expected but Im working on that could be some of the apps Im using

Really glad I upgraded to the S7 Its an incredible phone Awesome design Perfect size Amazing screen I like the always on display The camera is unbelievable I love this phone It is a great size and fits really well in my hand It has a great camera and I dont have to worry about delay Call quality is great and I love that you can add an SD card for even more storage I am so happy that Samsung brought back the SD card availability and I love the low light camera The gear vr is amazing My whole family loves them I am going to have to buy a few more I love the edge features I am just crazy about the s7 edge I dropped my phone with it inside the Speck case


It fell from thigh high sitting low car
 It slid out of my athletic shorts in case 3ft maybe

Speaker in phone is low quality but most are this is my third SamsungI had the s5 to s7 love Camera is unbelievable in low light Speed is goodcoming from a s5 there are somethings missing  Ir and base systems options are gone But after reading I guess people out there didnt like the options I owned a galaxy note 3 and a note edge and while they were good phones overall my new s7 edge absolutely blows both of them out of thevery water The camera is the fastest and most responsive one Ive seen The low light awesomeness that they advertise about is spot on I got great quality photos and videos from a music festival I went to last weekend The Samsung pay on this phone has blown some peoples minds It works almost everywhere Super convienent and f The screen is amazing and I have so far found no cons Buy this phone Do it do it NOW I love the phone screen with how big it is and the features are great I would defiantly tell anyone getting a new phone to get this one Im very happy with it The s7 camera is amazing The pro mode allows you to capture the best quality images I have never had a phone to create images of this caliber That alone is worth the money the screen is spectacular performance is good but can be better I like the connectivity with mac and the expanded memory this phone is awesome easy to use learned it quick I love my new galaxy S7 the ONLY thing I miss from the note edge is the large screen and the stylus I also miss the interchangeable battery It wasnt long ago Samsung ran a commercial about iPhone users being wall huggers well now Samsung users will be wall huggers right along with iPhone users I wish my 27th had a stylus a bigger screen like my note edge and the interchangeable battery but other than that the phone is awesome Im happy that I decided to get it This phone is beautiful and I have not had any slow downs I have a gears s2 as well and it is a great pairing I become a bigger fan of Samsung products everyday This phone is absolutely amazing The picture quality is my favorite feature I love the clearness and functions of the phone The screen is very bright and clear and the Samsung pay is great I got my first Samsung 3 generations ago and I loved it and now I have the 7th an DC I couldnt get anymore happier It runs faster has the thumb print security feature which I love as well its water resistant  And in my case of being a clutz it will be handy Also the sensor next to the camera to help you take selfie is niceif thats your thing plus it has on option for you to take a selfie with multiple friends or a large group which is nice so you dont cut anyones head off lol Love my phone cant wait to use all the neat features I have owned this phone for about 2 weeks now and I feel as if there have been more feature options for this phone then any other iPhone I have ever owned Battery life I would say is mildly better not enough to make it noticeable display is far better than the iPhone The front facing camera can also point out that Im a lot more uglier with my galaxy than with my iPhone So that might be an upside for some people for me it hurts my self esteem Nice phone Had the Galaxy S5 prior to getting this one Loving the extra storage and clearer pictures that the S7 takes This phone has everything you want and more Excellent camera vivid picture quick to multitask It has a SD card slot and built in wireless charging The parts where this phone lack are not having a removal battery and the back casing being just as fragile as the front glass I love the S7 I like that there is a significant difference in the features I had a S5 and I loved it but I love the S7 even more Absolutely love my S7edge It is packed full of great features The battery life is about 24 hours with regular use The fast charge charges from 10 to 100 in just over an hour 
A few cons are this unit do the get as good of cell reception where my old Gs4 got full bars the GS7 only get 3 or 4 bars Also there is no IR transmitter to use it as a remote Nothing major the phone works great and I would definitely buy it all over again The display is crisp and brightThe phone is very responsive and camera is great at low light picks As my first allmetal premium phone my expectations were high Since I got the phone Ive been amazed by the performance appearance and battery life I love this phone I really love this phone is love the color and all the features Its a really kool phone if I drop it in water or spill soda on it it wont mess up as easily as others would Its very kool looking and also I love the edge how it works Its just an overall awesome phone Excellent design You feel special with a special gadget Features are awesome A pleasure to have delightful to use Greatly advanced voice and picture quality Feel HD quality on all images Battery life is amazingly longer It actually lasts a full day and possibly more Such a big relief from carrying your charger with you at all times Edge feature is so unique and if you get to use it quite exquisite Great phone Samsung strikes again Great as always I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and I love it I havent had any problems loading applications and the battery life is fantastic I dont have to charge my phone but once every two days I would totally recommend this phone This phone is very elegant but dont be deceived under the hood is a monster The most powerful phone I have ever tested All the features are to be liked my favorite is the always on display IP68 water and dust proof and last but the least the mighty meaty battery under the hood This is actually the first phone I had that lasted a day of use basically texting emailing and a little Facebooking I have the gold platinum edition which is very attractive Before I forget camera is so good at low light and it focuses really fast too before that feature is only available on DSLRs I love the appearance of the exterior of the phone The screen colors are brilliant and the ui is very responsive It fits perfectly in my hand and is comfortable to use I use email heavily throughout the day and check social media quite a lot and the battery life is great The only problem I have had is the screen went black and I could not operate the phone I had to do a battery reset and the phone has worked fine ever since After 2 weeks I really miss my S6 edge It was an excellent phone The gaming performance of this phone is the best for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds After 2 minutes the frame rate is half that of my s6 edge The ingame recording feature does not work well If the performance of the phone stayed the same and the back camera of the phone was the same as the s6 edge I would love this phone The new camera on this phone takes square shaped photos instead of the wide screen ones all the other phones take The low light photos do not come out that well on this phone The many new features make this the easiest phone yet Battery lasts forever camera is phenomenal features are exceptional speed is unbeatable Cant get enough of showing off this phone Call quality between two S7s is seriously unbelievable Everyone I call who has this phone makes comments about how clear the call quality is Amazing speakers for a tiny little phone Money well spent I like it It does the job It will be my phone for the next 3 years OMG Best phone ever very fast and great camera I wanted a top of the line device and I got it It runs everything smoothly takes fantastic pictures and the battery life is incredible more than double what I had with the Galaxy S4 The price tag might put you off but its worth every penny 

The edge screen takes a little getting used to but does increase the screen size slightly and the edge menu is extremely helpful I use the fingerprint reader constantly and at this point cant imagine having a phone without it

The fact that its waterresistant is just icing on the cake I have had galaxy phones ever since the S3 This is a great all around smart phone It hits all the areas I want in a phone I could drone on for hours about the features of this phone but in all honesty what you need to know about this phone is it is simply the best device ever made for android Everything works wonderfully and the camera is bar none the best ever put on a phone The build quality is immaculate and the style is awe inspiring Between various jobs and what not I have used dozens of different phones A few years ago I got the original samsung galaxy s1 and have only use the galaxy phones since Wonderful phone Samsung has really out done their selves this time around Fast easy to use so convenient Awesome glad I waited for the S7 I love this phone Great camera great feel great features whats not to like Battery life is great too This is an incredible phone Battery life is between 4 and 6 hours of screen on time whI checked these days is pretty fantastic Performance isnt an issue with the snapdragon 820 and 4gb of RAM Micro SD is a nice touch since it only comes stock with 32gb The gold silver color is very subtle and high end looking Fingerprints are a given with the glass and I would recommend a screen protector but it would cover up the great looks 
My only real complaint is palm detection on the edges I tend to press things on accident when holding it and its a bit frustrating Word is there is ano update inbound for better detection Frame rate drops to 15fps after a minute of games that use 3d no matter what settings are used Taking the case off the phone shortened the time of 60fps gaming The ingame video recording works for a minute then the videos are in super slowmotion The phone does not feel hot only slightly warm and that is when there is major performance issues in games The back camera take square shaped photos not widescreen like the s6 did Also there was no 4k video recording that I could find Low light photos are a little better still grainy Battery still at 50 at the end of the day it takes longer to charge than the s6 edge I love that its water proof and the cam is amazing especially under water I love the sleek look ease of use and overall design There are a couple items Ive found so far that Id like back but I still love the 7 I miss the IR hardware that let me control my tv
The waterproof feature is nice
I dont like that its advertised as being able to wirelessly charge but the wireless charger is sold separately 
I ordered my phone early bought it on the release date and filed the Gear VR offer but according to my claim status Im not eligible for the watch still havent heard about the oculus bundle
Im more excited about my S4 than this phone I am a big fan of all Samsung phones but I have seen huge improvement with Samsung Galaxy s7 It is faster sleeker and more elegant than ever Battery life is really good I love the improved camera features It is super sturdy as well plus I love that it is water resistant Finally it is a really great upgrade Great processor camera and features I love the thin design and added features Thank you Samsung for keeping up the great work As a working mom this phone has everything I need and could want The camera is outstanding for catching those in action moments I couldnt be happier I have always had Samsung phones and this one is the best so far It met all my expectations and then some Keep up the good work and I look forward to the next Galaxy Phone fits all my needs Love the updated TouchWiz very easy too use and the flashlight built in Havent had very long to bond I do wish they would have made the S7 with more than 32 Gig device memory but Im stoked samsung brought back the SD slot to add memory The lack of an SD slot is the reason I didnt purchase the S6 I like the water resistant design but havent been able to determine if that applies to both the S7 AND the S7 edge I wish that after reading a text you didnt have to hit the back button like the Motorola The battery seems to be ok if you watch the applications you download Sometimes the touch screen seems as though it isnt sensitive enough or miss touches Otherwise as with most Samsung it beats all the others by far I guess you kind of gets spoiled with Samsung devices Ive owned the Galaxy S1 S2 S4 and now the S7 With the S4 it was such a great phone i never needed up upgrade until now With SD card and 32 GB default memory it is exactly what i needed Also the water proofing makes me feel worry free

Phone is a lot faster and much better camera These are the reasons why I upgraded and will never look back Great feel to the phone as well I have been using samsung phones since the gs5 I had the gs6 edge and it was slightly underwhelming due to bad battery life and overheating This phone fixes every bad taste that last years phone left Awesome phone Only had the phone a week but really love it Very user friendly Love the Edge features Better than my old iPhone 6plus Love the realistic and bright colors and vibrant display Its a keeper I waited a long time for this phone and love it My husband wants to trade me for his Galaxy 6 which he loves too lol It takes incredible pix love the split screen super fast charging and the list goes on and on Im finding new capabilities every time I look This product has met all of my expectations that I was looking for with my new device I will recommend this and many other Samsung products to people I know I will be buying more products through the years Had a lot of Samsung phones hands down the best one yet Traded not for 7 edge love it I love this phone got it before the phone was out and in better than any other phone out Ithe is super fast and waterproofing is the best I wish there was USB type C but micro USB is fine Samsung somehow found the perfect size and ratio to get the most out of a large screen without requiring two hands to use the device I previously had the S6 edge and played around with an S6 edge  and this is the perfect compromise between the two Outstanding device since the start of the smart phone industry Keep them coming Samsung you are appreciated This is my 4th Galaxy S and they only get better I started with the original then had the 3 then 5 and now the 7 Picked it up yesterday and am loving it Best phone I ever owned Very simple use has excellent quality durable phone I have been using this phone for two weeks now and Ive found it nothing less than enjoyable There are a few quirks here and there but Im confident in the updates resolving all issues Overall and excellent phone the best Ive used to date I was having horrible battery issues with my S6 upped to the S7 and LOVE it I havent done it all yet but there are some features of new here you wont understand I enjoy experiencing playing with this phone I upgraded from the S5 to the Gold S7 I absolutely LOVE the S7 Its fast responsive and has great battery life Screen colors are vibrant and clear I took points off on design because the back collects fingerprints like crazy But if you use a phone case like the majority of people do itso not a problem About the Always On feature I wish there was a Sometimes On feature Id love to have it on during work hours but dont needwant it on outside of that and its a pain to constantly turn it on and off Also being able to control the brightness of the clock and have appts for that day show would be awesome I have not been disappointed with the quality my S7 Edge The phone sits in my hand comfortably and no longer has the sharp edges of the S6 Edges The camera is super fast and the front facing camera has a well balanced aperture The new edge features are vastly improved with the double width and I am looking forward to more app incorporation Another helpful tool is the variable flash light with five different levels The alwayson display is very useful at night and during my classes Am happy with the S7 over all great Camera easy shortcuts I always used my phone for a remote control never thought to check they took out the IR blaster Never thought to check Bright display  look camera quality excellent performance After owning an original Galaxy S and an S4 it was time for a new device
Had to skip the S6 because it did not have an SDCard slot but the S7 seems to be the right choice now Im impressed by the quick charging functionality and therefore dont miss the fact that I cannot swap the battery that much any more I have to admit that coming from a Samsung note 3 to an edge S7 that I might sound too over zealous or biased I have a cheap case waiting to buy a good case I have dropped it a few times and I have to say its a pretty tough phone So that said the auto suggest in SMS has been really good since I slide at getting the words right The glass edge for quick access has been pretty handy for camera use I follow phone tech pretty closely and this is easily the best phone out right now The colors pop off the screen battery lasts more than a day even with heavy usage camera is fantastic Touchwiz is surprisingly useful and not obstructive and its lightning fast Very happy with my s7 Its a decent phone Not really that different from my last phone or the one before that Great camera though Before purchasing the s7 edge I had my doubts about the edge series phones At the time I had the galaxy s5 and really enjoyed the simplicity yet power of that phone I thought the edge must just be a gimmick for a few extra dollars to get features I would never use I was completely wrong though It was upgrade time and the new s7 and s7 edge were about to come out My girlfriend being a previous edge user managed to convince me to try the s7 edge Im more than happy with that choice In comparisson to the s7 it has a slightly larger screen it has a loner battery the extra features are great and it still has the great features I wanted from the normal s7 like being waterproof and the amazing camera The extra features on the s7 are definitely proving to be more than a gimmick as well They are easy to access customize and use and I find myself using th every day Overall I would say the s7 edge is a huge win It proved me wong in everything I thought I knew about it and is already my favorite phone that I have ever owned My wife and I have had our new Galaxy phones for about three weeks We are both quite happy Especially love the expanded memory ability great camera and water resistance Display is also crystal clear and menus well thought out Camera is sick 
Battery life is very very good 
Water resistance main reason I purchased I went from an iPhone back to galaxy The expandable memory and water resitance were the biggest selling points This phone is so much more durable and has wonderful features I absolutely love the ease of use and the camera takes the best pictures THE PHONE SHUTS OFF AT RANDOM TIMES Had an s5 Im enjoying the familiar updated features and sleek new design Works great and has many great features wish the store would have had the silver like I wanted but gold was my second favorite This one is one of the best phones possibly created by Samsung Not too big not too small just the right size I had an S5 before and compared to that its a big jump

Its a very fast phone with lots of RAM that is very important The camera is great The battery is great Display is great And finally colors and design of the covers are very good The S7 is the best phone I have ever owned The many features ease of use and beautiful design is unsurpassed I am recommending this new Samsung to EVERYONE I know I had the Galaxy S4 the S5 and now the S7 and waiting for the next version now The S7 seems lighter and thinner as I carry my phone in my pocket I like the constant on very much it shows I have messages without my swiping on to check Also like the way the settings are shown and arrangedeasy to find and use Passed on the S6 as it did not have a slot for an SD cardand now the S7 has as I have all my photos on the SD card to be able to take it out to print etc and even to same a card if desired for future and simply insert a new card This then is another definite plus for the S7 as both the sim card and the SD card are in a small pull out tray making it easy to remove the SD card print and replacewhereas the other models required taking off the back etc I got the Gold edition and use a case that is clear on the back thus the phone is more exposed to show the very nice appearance of the overall phone Along with my Samsung Gear S I have total and efficient communications as well as all the other features I love the new 7edgeI love the fast charging capabilities and the water resistant feature is prefect for the type of job I have Only thing I dislike is the price but I personally feel all phone these days are overpriced But all in all Samsung did a great job with this one Great new features screen display is amazing light enough to fit in top pocket This is by far the best phone I have owned One of the best features is the water resistance Didnt think I would be needing it then it started raining and I was just smiling as I remember how I would always put my phone in my pocket first thing Even though there are no revolutionary design changes in the new S7 model the changes that were implemented are all for the better New Android v6 Marshmallow is noticeably better than previous versions a couple of nice features like Always On Display improved battery performance or putting the SD card back in one of the design mistakes of Galaxy S6 corrected make it even more desirable Finally making the phone waterproof like S4 used to be is a nice bonus This phone has everything you need and runs fast The camera is awesome I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the S7 I was very disappointed in the lack of certain features of the S6 I was ecstatic you all brought those features back This phone just blew me off everything is so beautifully done I just cant stop playing with it I started with the Galaxy S5 and loved it I still love my S7 but the IR blaster was removed and I did not realize that when I purchased the phone I used this feature often I am also having a problem using Microsofts wireless display adapter The system sees the adapter but fails to secure a connection so I am unable to use this feature also Other than these two problem I really like my S7 Edge I was initially worried about the Edge and about losing the stylus from my note 4but this phone hasnt ceased to delight The call quality is clear The screen is beautiful and bright and the edge panels are cool It feels a lot more comfortable and better put together than my wifes S7 not edge
The camera is where this phone really shines though It takes amazing pictures especially in low light Highly recommend the upgrade Very easy to use great picture quality and overall a very nice phone I have been waiting to upgrade from my S5 especially since I dropped it and had a shattered screen

The S7 feels great and performs great

The first I received had battery issues ATand T exchanged it and this one is INCREDIBLE

Camera is unbelievable

Thank you Samsung From the day that i got my new galaxy s7 I was more than impressed From opening the box just the look of the phone itself impressed me As I have owned multiple galaxy devices before I knew what to expect and was not disappointed All the new features such as the waterproof capability and the low light camera make the phone excellent I am overall very satisfied and I cant wait for samsung to keep making the galaxy line better and better The notifications on screen are amazing and the flexibility of what I can change is endless
The camera is better than the naked eye in lowlight conditions No more annoying flash is necessary to capture precious moments
Expandable memory is a must for video camera and music lovers and as well as documents for business
The 7 Edge is the perfect size It is large enough for easier typing yet small enough to put in my pocket It is lightweight too Love the shiny case
The speaker is outstanding and very clear There is a much improved handheld sound
I have already spilt water on it with no issues great phone alot of great features preforms flawlessly omly issue i have no hdmi output function I had been looking forward to the day when I could finally get my hands on this Samsung Galaxy S7 Definitely a great upgrade from my previous galaxy phones It is the best one yet The camera takes amazing photos the battery lasts much longer I am completely satisfied with my S7 the difference from the s6 to the s7 can be seen right from the start Huge upgrade on the battery life New edge screen is more practical and easy to use Dont wait go get this phone I am coming from the Galaxy S4 The difference is incredible This phone has so many features that work the way they were designed I am a photographer and the capabilities of the camera are very good 
 I just got the phone so a lot to learn I cant wait to find all the various features Got to love the waterproof feature I have lost a couple of phones to water Great overall look and feel And the screen is beautiful Thanks for the great phone I really really love my new galaxy s7 I upgraded from a galaxy s4 I wasnt convinced by the s5 or even s6 
The overall feel of the phone is really nice although at times I feel like Im holding an iPhone I wasnt too happy about the headphone jack being located on the bottom but Im getting used to it Either way I use wireless headphones Its just annoying with a AUX cable in the car
It performs flawlessly Although after a recent update my phone overheated to a ridiculous temperature I couldnt even touch the phone as I was afraid to burn myself or somehow make the display shatter It took about an hour for it to fully update and cool down This is a great phone It is easy to hold although I wish the onoff button was higher on the side where Im not as likely to accidentally turn off the phone feels good in my hand and is lighter than my last phone  always a good thing I am getting great battery life The screen is big enough that I can play a game if I am waiting in a doctors office for instance Even though it is bigger than my last phone it still fits in the outside pocket of my purse I hope I dont have to buy another phone for a long time but I would sure get this one again I have one game that I play pretty often and it is totally slow and lags on the s7 I have to use my old phone to play Besides that I had no service when I went into NYC yesterday for the longest time even tried shutting off the wifi but still no service and wasnt able to connect to anything I never had that problem with my old iPhone The battery drains pretty quickly on mine too even though I wasnt using it that often It does take excellent pictures though I feel like I just bought a really expensive camera though The phone is great and upgrading from a broken S4 makes it even better The camera is amazing and I receive compliments all the time for my photos Im glad Samsung brought back expandable storage When I heard they did away with the replaceable battery I at first thought this would be a downside but I bought extra batteries for my old S4 and ended up never using them Overall the phone is amazing and I love it I only have one personal dislike though It has a data usage warning that would be nice if I didnt have unlimited data Theres no way to turn it off if you exceed 5GB Most everything else is customizable so you can make your phone how you like Keep up the great work Samsung Add a shatterproof screen and the phone will be almost perfect I love the battery life and quick charging options Have had galaxy phones since the s2 and loved them all but the 7 is the combination of all the best features while losing some of the lessor ones Havent gotten wet yet but no fears Great phone Nice size for Pocket on hand responsive good battery and charges quickly I only wish it had come in white but thats minor compared to the rest of its features I love that its water resistant Great display in size and quality I highly recommend playing with the Samsung Gear VR headset by Oculus I have a review for that device on my public profile if youre looking for accessories but are unsure about them
Camera takes sharp clear images Almost as good as iPhone in my opinion
The phone itself loads any application efficiently with ease
The battery life so far is pretty great I used my Galaxy s7 and went through ten 23 minute episodes of my favorite show on 45 battery life and had less than 15 left Netflix is the heaviest strain on my battery life but the Galaxy S7 handles it with ease I bought the wireless charger which is a convenient device that deserves its own review You can find that on my public profile
Expandable memory Need I say more The camera is awesome I love that you can unlock it using your thumb I have had one issue the screen went completely black The lights at the bottom still lit up but thanks to Google I was able to reboot it Over all I am happy with my purchase I love this product Have better application This phone is very helpful This phone is amazing The cameras are amazing The battery life is amazing So glad they brought back the expandable memory with this one I am in love I absolutely love everything about this phone Its lightweight It takes the clearest pictures Its fast and I love the titanium I would recommend this to anyone I loved the remote control feature from the S5 but in the new S7 the IR blaster has been removed and will no longer allow the phone to act as the remote control for the Samsung TVs Overall I love the phone The low light functionality of the camera was one of the big reasons I bought the phone However I am disappointed in its macro abilities The previous Samsung phones had great macro ability I frequently used my phone as a magnifying glass The new phone does not do this very well

However the low light ability is great It does take great photos in dim light

The new operating system has some nice perks to it but it has stayed mostly the same as my Note Edge So it wasnt a culture shock to make the change

Also the speakers are not quite as loud as the Note Edge All the greatest features of a smartphone super quick finger print reader good battery life amazing display waterproof smooth when operating and even easy to hold in hand This piece of art is gorgeous in every shape and form Fast and reliable And the battery life is amazing Only thing is the screen protectors never stay on with some cases I have been an IPhone user for as long as they existed and decided to give the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge a try I have never been so impressed Speed Display Clarity Incredible Camera Waterproof Expandable Storage and a host of other bells and whistles to round out the total package This is an awesome phone and I dont ever see me going back to the IPhone again The GS7 Edge is a great phone very comfortable in your hands Its not too heavy but has super long battery life Yet it is small enough to fit into the front pocket of my jeans Still getting used to phone only had it a couple weeks had to call Verizon couple times to help me find things on phone Right now my biggest problem is my text messages dont make a noise when I receive one even though my notications is at max with a sound I will contact Verizon again to figure this out this is what you expect from a Samsung Galaxy phone it has all the current bells and whistles I like that they went back to the water and dust proof design this was one of the major factors for me not getting the 6 This phone also added back the SD micro card port with a little slide out on top The wireless charging is nice it even charges thru a case like the Otter Box Defender I fee this phone should be what people look at if they want to switch over from the IPhone or even other android phones  I really love this new galaxy s7 I believe that its very fast and always is reliable and fast I am also very excited about the durability of the phone Upgraded from a galaxy 3 to the 7 edge and really impressed with the improvements and ease of use Additionally am extremely happy with the battery life I am not a Samsung fan This phone however is way ahead of my past experiences It is snappier than their older products and it has some value added extras like the edge app I am still afraid of Samsung and their history of not updating their phones I guess it remains to be seen if that happens this go around Great design very comfortable to handle Camera is great and the phone features are excellent Just needs to be less sensitive on touch screen Also the data toggle needs to be back on dropdown screen and place flashlight as a widget I absolutely love my S7 It does everything I want it to do and more I will never NOT own a Samsung phone Love my new S7  really love the gold My only complaint so far is battery life I was expecting a little better but with a smartphone and using it often this is to be expected Other than that its wonderful Great phone love the feel prefect hand size also like the waterproof since i fish alot also love the wireless charging feature This is the best phone of 2016 by far this is samsungs best phone by far The Galaxy s7 has the best camera and screen on the market I like the finger print login over the pin its much faster I have purchased a Galaxy phone every year since the S3 and it justs keeps getting better and better The apps open slower than my previous S6 the over all performance is not impressive It is water resistant and a little easier to master the operation This product is great The camera take terrific pictures You can Navigate with ease through out the phoneAll and all a Awesome phone Try it you will fall in love with it and never go back to other phones While the S7 might be a bit pricey it is quite a nice phone Love a phone with SD card expansion and that is waterproof It is also quite sprite Buy and enjoy This is a great phone and I couldnt have designed a better phone myself I love the camera and the camera features Love the S7 great battery life Water resister is a feature that all phones should have Pros are the camera the speed and Ive never seen a phone have such a clear crisp image when in the sun Cons are battery life fully charged it lasts 1 day on ultra power saving mode My s5 could last 3 days on ultra power saving mode Another con is that my apps disappear from my home screen all the timestill working on that one i am very disapointed that it does not have a talk to text on the keyboard like my S6 and S5 before that Now i am unable to voice to text while at a stop in my vehicle or on the freeway now i have to type and text which makes no sense I have upgraded from an S4 Im very impressed with all of the improvements The processor speed is nice Camera is amazing The display is clear and colors are bright and beautiful The first thing that hit me was the display screen the picture quality is very impressive The camera rivals any point and shoot digital camera out there I took a couple pictures of my dogs and was very impressed with the quality and definition in the photos The sound quality while making phone calls was best stated by my wife when she said it sounds like you are right here in the room with me For older eyes the display screen easily zooms in and out for easy reading of texts and emails The large screen is big enough to make reading easy but not so big that the phone is cumbersome to carry in a pocket even a shirt pocket Then there is the expandable memory simply slip a micro SD card into the phone and away you go This phone is a winner Lovwe the upgrades on the new s7  expandable memory waterproof design but buyer beware These features come with a price Not just a hefty price tag but also be prepared for some serious lag time when trying to utilize such features as camera app whIle texting for example The s7 seems to have some minor bug issues to work out before it can beat its predecessor the s6 I love everything about this phone especially the camera Its all of Samsung greatest hits wrapped into one device The external storage allows me to never worry about running out of space I have piece of mind around liquids the phone is fast and the battery lasts longer then any other device I have owned I would highly recommend the galaxy s7 to anyone Its simple to use but has so many great features that you can personalize it to fit your lifestyle I love all the new features the waterproof the speed the clarity I had ano S5 and I was impressed by how easy it was to go to the S7 and how similar they were The upgrade and improvements are just right Not crazy or over the top Samsung products are the best I finally upgraded from my S4 I find there is a bit of a learning curve between the two phones Overall the functionality is simple and userfriendly The design is clean and very similar I am very glad the size has not increased by much It is certainly a much faster phone and the sound and video quality is better Features and speed are spot on Software is a little clunky but manageable Edge functionality bring a lot of great features however it sometimes gets in the way hoping its user issue and once I get comfortable with the phone they should go away Water and dust resistant is a huge plus The Galaxy S7 Edge is by far the best phone I have owned to date Its fast feature rich and the battery actually lasts all day and then some That is huge in my book The designers really took their time and listened to the users and tailored it The fit and finish is excellent as well Nice phone with great features Camera is nice Takes great pictures Expandable memory is nice feature I love the edge I use the edge buttons all the time So fast and easy to call just the right friend in a hurry when your friend buttons are on the edge that i can literally call them with my eyes closed Stunning pictures great zoooooom and maybe its because my eyes are over 40 Id have bought it just for the high contrast keys I love them so much Ive bought high contrast key stickers for my laptop and I cant imagine why all keyboard keys havent always been yellow and black Seems such a small thing  but every little struggle in life removed makes life sweeter thanks a lot OBAMA I mean SAMSUNG  Seriously I LOVE MY PHONE It is a great product  fast charge the battery  its fast I had not had a product like this  the camera is the best  the color of the images is perfect the graphics of the games is the best It is best that happened to me Purchased with the hope of not having to blemish the beautiful design with a protective case
I have relatively small hands and can envision it slipping out of my hand with chance of breaking awesome phone very fast with a ton a cool features I have had a few different galaxies and this one is the best by far It would get all five stars if I could change the battery but at least they used a good size one I can go all day on pretty heavy use and it holds a charge all day The screen is great and there are features on here I never expected I can log onto websites with my fingerprint instead of typing in a name and password I love that I dont have to worry about water as much My previous phone was the s4 and my grandson threw it in the bathwater I was able to rescue it by removing the battery and letting it sit for 2 days to dry out but am so happy that I wont need to worry about that as much anymore Love that it has an SD slot that was a major decision maker for me Wish the battery was removable Love the fast charge and that it tells me how long until fully charged I also got the gear s2 and love that I can leave my phone in a safe place when I am out doing messy things like yard work and not miss any calls or messages although the vibration on s2 is too weak I have to constantly check the watch for new notifications Wish Burton actions would be customizable  never use Google now so long press of home button is wasted on meoverall very happy with my purchase although a bit more customizeability would have been wantrf it was a splurge thats well worth it for me Phone is easy to use Apps are a breeze to download and utilize Screen and picture quality are super clear Phone is simply awesome The quality of the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge are great The dual edge screen is a great look to it The sound and display are just amazing So far the phone has lived up to the hype Excellent speed charging multiple applications operating does not bog down the system screen is crystal clear extra memory can be installed and by far best phone on the market Coming from am s5 to this s7 I love this phone I do miss my ir from my s5 which I used daily But I am okay with out it The rose gold color is beautiful The pictures I take are beautiful the new features aswell Great speakers Easy to use I love that I came customize it so much I upgraded from an S5 to the S7 edge and I couldnt be happier I bypassed the S6S6 edge because of the lack of external memory This is a big one for me because Ive noticed I run out of memory fast With all the picturesvideos taken app data and so much more you never know when youre about to run out of space On to the phone I love its sleek design Compared to the S6 edge I would say this is a smoother version I especially love that the rear camera doesnt stick out compared to the S6 Not that its a big difference but its all in the details Speaking of camera I love shooting with this camera front and rear Im not much of a selfie type person but I admit this had me taking a few selfies ever since I got this phone Love the different modes and honestly I havent played with all of them yet but Im loving the video collage mode Also the edge features are super helpful I like keeping my phones organized and the edge feature just is oh so helpful with that Keeping all my favorite contacts shortcuts and often used apps in just a quick slide I also love the battery life in this one Although its too early to tell but so far so good If theres a knack I have for the S7 edge is the IR infrared Although its seldom used but if Im not mistaken Ive read that Samsung has taken this feature out from the S7 which is mindboggling to be honest It wouldve been nice to use the phone as a remote for my Samsung TV or my cable TV Its not much to complain about but it wouldve been nice to have that feature If Im mistaken by this I apologize I just read it somewhere when I tried to pair my phone with my cable TV I upgraded from an S4 which was a great phone but was starting to act funny The S7 so far is almost everything it was advertised as One negative I immediately noticed was the lack of the IR blaster which I frequently used In fact right after the unpacked event I checked out the specs and they did say it had this feature so I was disappointed to find out it didnt Still all in all this is a great phone If you have been waiting around for your upgrade now is the time to do so This phone delivers what is promised From picture quality to blazing fast speeds to multitasking Samsung has thought of it all Give it a try The S7 Edge by far one of the best phone Ive used I tested the battery and got 24 hours from fully charged to 10 It is very fluid in terms of speed I do highly recommend ppl to get one Overall quality and performance of this product is by far the best Ive ever used on a phone
screen quality camera quality processor design is 100 times better than any other phone in the
market A must have for sure Its water resistant that actually works Wow just wow
Great job Samsung I purchased the Galaxy S7 Edge recently and have been impressed so far The speed of the operations is staggering to me because I was used to a 5 year old Droid The camera takes beautiful pictures without effort I am looking forward to using the phone in the future Im not a very technical person so I am enjoying how everything on the phone is very user friendly I especially love how good my pictures come out and all I have to do is point and click Bright clear display and the added micro sd card was much needed Wish its a little cheaper though super battery life expandable memory and lots of new features make this a great phone I have had almost every galaxy phone that has come out with the exception of the S5 and S6 I was frustrated with the S4 and S3 but this phone has been absolutely problem free plus I have more battery life than both S3 and S4 combined The phone has the common galaxy features that I loved before but everything seems so smooth and easier to use Transferring information from the S4 to the S7 was easier than ever too I honestly was about to give up on Samsung phones but the S7 really made me fall in love with them again I have better reception and longer battery life what more could I ask for I have the brand new Galaxy S7 Edge and Im in love I love it so much that I bought 3 more for my family and it was a really great buy Its loved by us all and even preferred to all the phones we have owned before this We were varied users of many different brands of phones and found and love now the same phone because it has so many different features that really make it very easily customizable to each persons style and needs perfectly so that even though they are the same phones they are so different at the same time I love the new upgrades from the S6 edge like the waterproofed feature and the expandable memory as well and how the battery last so much longer in use and on standby and finally the size improvements which is just right for me now and I love how I can change my phones theme as often as I change my mind I havent ran into any problems and my experience is a great one and I thank the tech gurus that thought this beauty up because they did one heck of a job And last but not least I like the updates to the side bar it is far better than before and holds so much more and has more options and available addons which is really cool like a text reading bar and hopefully there will be more added to the list so that I can try more sidebar addons in the future From a perfectly content consumer THANK YOU I have had many Galaxies throughout the years ranging from the Epic to the multiple Notes While I am excited for the next Note I never knew I could love a non Note Galaxy again until I bought this masterpiece It is feature packed slim beautiful strong fast and has incredible battery life Works perfectly as marketed I have yet to have any problems or complaints Works perfectly Love the clarity of pictures and features the Galaxy 7 Edge offers Having it waterproof is a plus too I was finally able to switch from the Active to the Edge now that is water resistant I appreciate that Samsung is always thinking of ways to improve and offer more add ons then other cellular options This is the best phone Ive had thus far Love the shape of the phone though can be a bit slippery without a case I love the many features of the phone and Im still learning about more features on the phone I would definitely recommend this phone to others This is a great phone I love ther new black onyx color Samsung also did a great job by adding the expanded memory again Great battery life and fast performance I love the new Samsung Galaxy Edge S7 The design is smooth and somewhat thin in my opinion Ive only had the phone for a couple of weeks and still learning but so far its been great Love the fact that its water proof Also the option of the SD Card is back Thank you Samsung The screen seems durable Would absolutely recommend this to a friend My new S7 is fast fast fast The picture is incredible and the interface is simple to use I have dropped it twice and scratched the corner of the phone is my only issue I am really looking forward to trying VR GEAR when it arrives 
The phone is as promised and with the ability to add a SD card memory is not an issue I love my new Samsung 7 edge its incredibly versatile and the graphics are spectacular I have been a Samsung user for over 6 years and all your product are top quality Its awesome phone I like it because they battery life so good And the look is fully grand l This will be the best phone I hve used I have had the new Samsung Galaxy 7 for a couple of weeks now I am very happy with how everything functions My favorite things so far are the camera and the cascading windows of all open apps The color and size are also great I love everything about my new s7 edge except I dont like the black I waited to upgrade till it came out and then was EXTREMELY disappointed that I couldnt get the silver titanium because it was sold out The black doesnt show the edge design well And  well its just boring Ive owned S4 S5 and now S7best so far by long shot is S7 paired with Gear S2 What an upgrade S7 AMAZING features of this phone are so smooth its so smooth it will literally slip out ur hands lol low light cam just right cool features there as well buy it so worth it Im glad I waited for this phone to come out So glad Samsung has brought back expandable memory and water resistance Battery life is amazing Its sleek and not too big Great phone Samsung has always put out innovative and dependable devices This one ranks at the top of my list I am excited to have the Galaxy s7 It is a wonderful upgrade from my s5 It just does everything better and quicker I have never had an issue with the Samsung product I have 7 television including a 55 and a 60 and there all Samsung you make a great product Im in love with my new phone It came with Microsoft Office I was pleasantly surprised with numerous features and absolutely thrilled that its water resistant and shatter proof Ive dropped it numerous times with no scratches Thank you Samsung for the great Galaxy S7 Samsung knocked it out of the park on this one Gorgeous design Quality build Fast and Packed with useful features Hands down one of the best phones on the market today if not the best The Samsung Galaxy s7 is amazing Its waterproof the battery lasts a really long time and the picture quality is great Amazing battery life and waterproof Those are the 2 major things I was missing from an old phone and this phone took care of that I dont care about replaceable batteries because that generally affects water resistancell and this battery lasts longer enough anyway The slightly larger screen is perfect for me The edge looks nice but I find the features useless for me and it made it almost unusable without a case because I was constantly touching the screen accidentally just by holding the phone in my hand But I got a case I love and everything has been perfect since Very very happy with purchaseGreat phone Better than the 6 This is probably the coolest phone Ive ever owned It is a great phone I love the the screen feels and how the it looks sleek It does get hot with alot of use But I have seen that happen with all phones I like being able to change my theme to what ever I want The best part is the SD card slot for more space Title says it all It is a very good phone and I am happy I upgraded to this phone I cant wait to see what else Samsung has up their sleeves I upgraded from the S5 to the S7 I love the phone I got the gold and it looks so sharp in the clear case The screen and videos and pictures are so clear on it Its nice to have the expanded memory for it
The finger print protection is so much better than the S5 Instead of having to swipe your finger you just place it on the home button Works so much better The camera takes better pics and videos than the S5 The battery performance is also tremendous The call quality and speaker is so clear I had pre ordered the phone so I have had it since it was released on the 11th and I honestly can say I have found nothing to complain about it I simply love this phone Overall decent phone better then my previous S5 Glad the external SD is still available I have no complaints this phone does everything I needed to do plus its waterresistant I love the display I love the interface the design its easier to hold in your hand I am very happy with my new Galaxy 7 Edge Its working out great With many incredible features and the ability to expand the phones memory you cant go wrong with this purchase I would not want to own any other phone This phone is the best phone of 2016 The design and how it sits in your hand is just magic The edge features are great the battery lasts all day and the camera takes excellent pictures Love how fast the camera works and clarity of photos Awesome improvement from my s5 This phone has a lot of features More apps than I will likely use It has a larger battery which is very important to me I need a phone to be available all day to get my tasks done I will highly recommend this phone The large screen is very clear It takes very good pictures Samsung went all the way with the technology on the Samsung Galaxy Edge I preordered my Galaxy S7 and am so glad I did I knew I didnt want to upgrade from my iPhone after seeing all the great deals for the S6 because I knew the S7 was coming out a little while longer and Im glad I did Its design is excellent by making it stylish while still retaining water resistance and a micro SD card 2 things you cant get in anew iPhone The performance is solid The features are very cool and useful like accessibility and always on display I also love how the black doesnt have the bluish tint last years phone did Overall Id totally recommend this phone to anyone because it appeals to people of all sorts Thank you samsung for listening to peoples needs Love the phone just wish it was a little smaller for the small hands out there Otherwise no complaints Ive had Galaxies and Ive had more Galaxies Samsung has always produced a quality product When I got to the Galaxy S6 Edge I knew I found the perfect phone I thought it would be my last until the release of the Galaxy S7 Edge With the addition of extra storage and water resistance I didnt hesitate one second to preorder Then came the wait And man was it worth it When I unboxed it the first thing I noticed was the way it felt in the hand Samsung curved the back as well and it makes such a difference in comfort It is a bit taller than the S6 Edge but it is so comfortable to hold The back camera housing is more flush to the back and with the back curve it is easier to pick up than the previous model The phone is screaming fast Multiple tasks split screens and anything you throw at its processors will be handled with smooth transitioning and quick screen responses The finger print sensor is so smooth An improved edge screen is also worth mentioning as you have more ways than ever to customize it Instead of being a novel curved edge you will find yourself using it often Now comes the best thing so far The lock screen has an always on feature so that you can at a glance see the time date battery level and notifications without waking the phone It is customizable as well Oh the battery 3600mAh I have yet to go through a day when I didnt have enough battery power It paired well with the Gear Neo2 as well as the Gear S2 a whole other review on the watches later Side Sync app is also a great way to go from your phone to Galaxy Tab S and not miss a beat Another great thing I discovered is some additions to the camera You can take a 180 degree selfie to include all of your friends Low light photography is excellent As if this wasnt enough add the experience of the Gear VR and you have an adventure you just have to see for yourself I think this is not just another Galaxy it is a work of art The most advanced beautiful phone I have ever purchased Thank you Samsung for engineering the best products on the market This phone is the best phone Ive ever had A big upgrade to my old galaxy s5 phone Has better phone quality and the picture is amazing Runs smooth and fast and even the sound is great also Its waterproof which is awesome This is such a great phone that Id recommend it to everyone This is a MUST HAVE PHONE Great product
Inexpensive
love the performance
iphone killer So Ive had this phone for 2 weeks now and I love it but there are some areas of concern First the screen is extremely sensitive especially the edges I recently put a case on it and it has helped some but still pretty sensitive if your arent careful Also after installing an app from Google Play not certain exactly but think it was the Assistant app it started resetting by itself One day it done it about 5 times I was getting ready to return it for another one but decided to uninstall a few apps It hasnt reset since The battery doesnt seem to impressive either If you shut everything off but the basics its okay As for the video calling feature Samsung should be more clear on this feature You and the person you want to video call both have to have this feature and you both have to be in a 4G area Since my Wife and I live out in the country its no help to us We did however download the Skype app and it works great The camera and video is awesome and to us since we have Grandchildren is worth the price in and of itself Love that it has an SD card slot but you must use a name brand card Sound seems to be good and I like that you can customize it to your needs Since I am hard of hearing in one ear it showed that my left ear was the preferred ear for answering calls I have been a Samsung user for several years now and they always in my opion put out top quality phones The S7 edge isnt any different but just needs a few tweeks Maybe an update will be in the future to resolve some of these issues As for the edge feature I dont really use it I just got it because it was bigger than the regular S7 and so me and my Wife didnt get our phones mixed up Oh yeah no need for a screen protector Ive done a lot of research on this gorilla glass and its the best on the market Although maybe a screen protector would solve some of the sensitivity Having had several different android devices from different manufacturers and my last phone was a S5 I really have to say this what is exceeded my expectations 
 Despite the camera having been downgraded to 12 megapixels its picture clarity speedy auto focus and general image quality are very good The fact that the camera offers a professional mode where he can adjust all sorts of items that you can only usually just on your SLR camera is amazing The processor and go to memory is really fast and even 32 GB seem sufficient with an additional SD card as back up For gaming especially some VR applications and more computer intense applications it seems to be doing very well Another very cool feature which I think is under advertised is that it actually has an oximeter as well in addition to just the heart rate monitor Its nice to know your oxygen saturation isnt it Thankfully this model is also once again water and dirt resistance That is a big big selling point The phone feels good the screen is very reactive it has brilliant colors and an authentic reproduction in image and video quality The haptic feedback if you want to use this is also really useful Of the many phones in the past 20 years that Ive had naturally this is my favorite The only negative thing that I would list is that as with all phones that are hungry for energy the battery life is not quite as good as you would want But Samsung is the only company that is builtin ultra power saving so if you want to go back to the oldfashioned way and use your phone as believe it or not only a phone you will have battery life for 10 or more days How does your iPhone look now Go galaxy I am really enjoying having this phone Its a slimmer design which I like The camera is fantastic it runs fast and has easy to use features I have owned quite a few Samsung phones and this is the best one by far I am amazed by the camera and screen resolution I did not get the S6 only because of the lack of sd support I am very happy that it was brought back for the S7s Well balanced phone lightweight really good Camara easy access Really love the new edge Looks like it was made of pure quality materials Has a great feel in the hands and performs as a true flagship should I love my Galaxy S7 its fast sleek and has a has awesome battery life This is by far the best smartphone ever produced by Samsung or any other manufacturer Everyone who sees it in my hand comments on the beauty but I know the true wonder of the phone is the awesome performance The combination of fast processor bright screen powerful camera and exclusive functions put it way over the competition As a long time owner of several S series i am very pleased by the changes for the s7 compaired to the s6 tho its a good phone to yet storage limitations The s7 overall is fast and reliable with plenty of ram great camera beautiful video playbacklow light capable camera and high sdcard capability My experience has been very flawless compaired to my prior s6 and better performance then my wifes brand and type of phone Love the phone Samsung delivers great products This phone is way better than my s5 Best upgrade Ive had I love everything about this phone the sleek shape waterproof and all those things that make Samsung great I love the camera features and the screen clarity is a lot better as well overall I love my new phone I do love this phone super fast and the edge screen has been improved and finally a SD card slot The water resistant and no worries about dropping in water Really great looking phone and backed up with awesome performance I couldnt be happier This phone was made for your hands Its sleek design and light weight is a beautiful combination for comfort This phone also has the clearest speaker it sounds like the person youre talking to is in the room with you The battery life is amazing and the gaming features are on point I love being able to block notifications The cameras features are worth it alone Beautifully done Samsung First of all I really love all samsung products Ive had the Galaxy S1 S4S5 active  now I have the S7  I absolutely love it Ive been very pleased with every Samsung phone Ive had but the S7 is by far the best It has an awesome camera front  back which was very important to me because i take A LOT of pictures especially of my 2 year old daughter Every picture I have taken with this phone has been great The camera automatically focuses when you take a picture which is great They look like theyre taken on a real camera not on a phone The battery is also great I use my phone a lot but I never have to charge this one more than once a day I also love the style of this phone It is very nice looking especially the gold color Overall this is the best phone Ive ever owned This phone has a great sized screen for reading my online textbooks and emails I also love the edge feature to just check my notifications while I am at work My daughter loves this phone the battery life is way way better then the S6 and the camera is amazing She is a very happy customer one of the best choices I have made in a long time Amazing phone phenomenal camera great handfeel Wish more of my cards worked with Pay but thats not Samsungs fault Awesome product that has beautiful edge Would really recommend to all people Phone is da bomb I really like the Galaxy S7 Still trying to figure out some things on it but I love it This phone is truly amazing Smoothy Beautiful The only flaw is the edge is too sensitive I love it so much I got 3 of my friends to buy one Great phone This is my 4th Samsung Galaxy phone I do love the quickness of this S7 Its user friendly but 8 days after I got it I had black screen issues which I have never experienced before on a Samsung phone Overall Im pleased with my purchase and would recommend I wish I knew all the new features Sleek and perfectly fits in my hand with out any trouble Preforms quick and charges fast
Takes beautiful pictures with ease and has so many features that I havent even looked through all with in the week Ive had it Had S4 S5 S6 now S7 Really like the phone Built very well and definitely most solid feeling phone of my list Picture contrast and colors are awesome Cool new features and a good upgrade from S6 Battery life much better as well I love my phone take great pictures the speaker is nice and loud the 3d games are amazing and is water proof The only down fall is my phone has froze 5 times and I had my phone only 3 days other than that I would buy this phone again This product is awesome samsung finally got its stuff together Probably one for the best phones ever had Battery is amazing I love this phone I really could stay with this phone for good  this is my 6th samsung phone and they keep getting better I wish they kept the ir blaster but I can live without it Im glad they put back the SD card It continues to evolve and become a more useful tool I might be a bit late to the party but they hit a home run with the S7 This phone is sleek and fits the hand very nice Besides bringing back the sd card the battery is the best thing samsung did to this phone Even at pretty heavy use light gaming most of the day I still have 20 battery left at the end of the day There are many handy settings if you dig for them in the settings menu The screen is beautiful and is a very good size if you want a larger phone but dont want a phablet Unlike the s6 edge software the s7 edge software works flawlessly
Really the only complaint I have is that samsung took away the ability to toggle the multiwindow on and off I personally dont use it but somehow I keep activating it when I dont want to Also the s7 edge is slippery so I would recommend a case but the phone is really durable
If you want a new phone I highly recommend going for the edge its definitely worth the extra 150 The edge features and big battery are really handy The normal s7 is a great phone as well if you dont like the edge I like that u can change the outline look on the texts have an image instead of the boring old text that has been around from the gecko also like all tha features for tha camera especially for the people who like to take pictures change the the aspect of it Having owned an S2 Skyrocket S3  S5 Active prior to my S7 Edge Ive been using Samsung phones for some time now Its nice to see they listened to the consumers and brought back the SD card slot Had they not my S5 Active would probably have been my last Samsung Now if they would just listen to us and ditch TouchWiz and give us a more native Android Experiance Id be very happy This feature packed phone is a necessity for my work I am in love with this phone specially the edge feature because i always place my phone upside down i can always see the side lighting of the person calling me Thanks samsung for this wonderful device ive been a samsung user since s4 and i have a galaxy tab s and it is perfect I am happy to live the samsung life This device is extremely versitile Its snappy performance coupled with its cutting edge design and features make this phone the best iteration of the Galaxy series The only thing I miss is the removable battery This feature is a must to set it apart from competing products Also this device could in fact be slightly larger Ive been a android user for quite some time The first phone Ive had was the S5 and loved it Battery life seemed to be a little bad so I always seemed to have the phone on power savings This is also considering the phone was jailbroken and many background apps never ran Instead of upgrading it to the S6 I decided to wait for this phone Totally worth it

This phone is by far the best one Ive owned so far Its like having an S5 but on steroids Battery life is great and it processes all apps without issues Took me a little while to figure out that apps such as Pandora and other music streaming music dont run so well when on power savings you cant tell the difference in performance of the phone in that setting except when streaming music music cuts out very annoying I have been using Samsung Galaxy phones since the beginning and usually had something to complain about with each model Samsung did it right with this model It looks good feels good and performs well Many of the features from the S6 Edge are the same but with expandable memory and a solid processor this phone meets the challenge I use this phone a lot for work and for the first time I am experiencing a flawless performance Do yourself a favor and get one Crazy camera bountiful battery super storage and dynamite design Its hard not to love this phone The phone in nicely designed and works great I enjoy the fact we can install an additional memory card One of most important factors was the ability to make WiFi calls Nice design and feels good and comfortable in the hand Just get one Love love love this phone Samsung does a great job of delivering great place I also got the Gear S2 with this phone and they work great together What an awesome combo This is why I love my Samsung devices they always have what i need most of all in them I love the new feature with the expandable memory love it The system is fast and very user friendly I also love the sleek design and the true gold color 

Would highly recommend to anybody Great phone for recording games for YouTube New gaming feature is amazing able to record and able to turn off return buttons Get more features without jail breaking on Android using the u power saver is the great when your not trying to using all the features of your phone at a time was able to go to a festival and after 12 hours I still had over 80 battery Camera looks amazing and the water proof case is amazing dont take it diving but it has been under water works amazing Android though you lose performance when multi tasking and it is still a bit expensive but cheaper than an iphone I recently upgraded from a galaxy s5 The camera features are incredible Its faster than my last phone couldnt be happier Being able to record my games and turn off notifications when playing is awesome Im old school about cell phones I keep phones for awhile This phone is super fast Call quality is great 
 My last phone was a HTC This is a huge upgrade Battery life is crazy good I have no complaints Im 2 weeks in and convinced I will own this phone for a few years Love my phone Great camera amazing battery life super fast going from app to app On top of all the features of the S6 the S7 has many more new and advanced features that were unheard of combined I love this phone coming from an s5 The edge is a neat feature the conceals apps and off my main screen Sometimes Web content has a link that on the edge portion not a big deal just different Also the screen is sometimes overly responsive When I scroll it will occasionally open links I was trying to scroll past The Samsung pay has been great Very convenient and even merchants are impressed I love it when they say they dont accept it but then it works This is a very nice phone most of my objections about earlier products have been addressed However battery life is still poor it must be charged before the end of the day even with moderate usage and the gorilla glass is more like butterfly glass because it is VERY easily scratched The camera is superb the overall speed of the device is excellent and that it accepts an SD card is great The bluetooth is much better behaved than the S4 My only issue is the poor battery life In my opinion an acceptable battery for this phone needs at a minimum 30 more capacity It is ameliorated some by the very fast charging The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the latest and greatest It is quick in every aspect The camera launch and opening every app The SD card made me purchase this phone Ive been a Samsung fan for years and the S6 just didnt do it for me I waited and Im glad I did The GS7 is the best phone samsung has made to date The design is spectacular and feels premium It is also very easy to hold with the curved edges on the back of the phone The camera in low light and in general is beyond outstanding Also my battery life is incredible I was a little hesitant to buy this phone because it had a non remove able battery but the battery lasts me all day and then some And I am a heavy power user I am beyond impressed Samsung Excellent job with the Galaxy S7 The phone is great I got a S7 Edge and BOGOd a S7 nonedge They are both great phones I have had Galaxy phones since the SII and this one is amazing compared to previous versions Upgraded from the 5 to the 7 recently Had it for over 2 weeks I love the metal frame for the phone the weight it has and the curves on it Second feature the camera is great This phone went with me on a school research trip to the virgin islands and wow the colors it captures is great plus great reaction time for burstsport photos

Only complaint they removed samsung music app from factory and replaced it google music But samsung music can be redownloaded in the play store 

This phone has great body inside and out I love the feel of the new S7 in my hand The screen is smooth and reacts well to touch I am disappointed that some of the features of my last phone S5  like the notification reminder and being abe to put some system apps into my own folders do not function as they once did I miss that I do however love the Samsung keyboard feature of text shortcuts it makes typing so much faster Ive lost to many features from my S5 no longer able to link my FB contacts with my phone contacts so Ive lost the ability to use my groups as well as seeing the picture of who is calling Also my FB calendar not longer links up with the phone calendar The battery life is not that much better either I have to recharge at least twice a day sometimes three times Also the ability to no longer be able to replace the battery isnt a great option Ive had the Galaxy S3 and S5 this phone is so much better The edge function is interesting and I look forward to more widgets for it The phone is snappy and the camera is incredible particularly in low light Like the design and Love that you brought back the expanded memory card Thats an big plusThe camera is very good and I also like the wiWireles charger The S7 lives up to all of the hype The battery life is longer the screen colors are vivid and the sound is crisp and crystal clear Best Phone I ever owned Everything is fast and fluid Camera takes amazing pictures even in low light I dont have to worry if it gets splashed with water or drop in the sink The S7 Edge is by far the best Galaxy S phone yet Plenty of features good battery life and an awesome screen Pros
Feels good in the hand
Great display
Faster charging
Better signal strength
Buttons have excellent feel
Android Pay
Excellent Camera


Cons
Cant add just the voice search icon to the home screen
Curved screen is horrible cant get a good quality glass screen protector that covers the whole screen Awful design
Screen mirroring is very laggy
With security set to pattern you have to swipe twice to get in
No USBC backward compatibility would only require an adapter
I expected better battery life
Havent found the task manager yet if there is one

So far i like the phone im sure they will make improvements with firmware upgrades It looks great Takes great photos I would recommend it This thing can do anything you can dream of the best phone i haved for a long time all around is perfection i would recommend getting this phone over other brands no questions asked thank you samsung team keep the great work I love this galaxy Battery life is amazing and it if super fast Price is high but worth it This phone works really well The camera is crystal clear and with the ability to expand the memory it can hold a ton of pictures videos apps etc 

The screen is normal size about what youd expect for a smartphone the Edge version is much much larger my friend has one 

The speaker works really well and is actually located on the bottom of the phone instead of the back so you can lay it on a table and the sound doesnt get distorted 

If youre a fitness geared person this phone can monitor your heart rate SpO2 level and stress levels with a built in sensor near the camera 

The processor works really well too applications run fast without too many glitches which is mainly app issues not the phone 

I love the fast charging capability because it actually works however the phone gets really hot when on the charger Even if youre not on the phone while it charges it can heat up petty quick The battery also loses charge fast if you actually use your phone I mainly use mine for texting friends and family during breaks at work and occasionally hop on an app or two for about 10  20 minutes I also make sure to force stop apps so they dont run in the background but the battery still drains faster than Im used to with previous phones This could be an isolated incident but keep a lookout for a fast draining battery Other than that I love this phone Switched from iPhone to Samsung totally great decision After having lots of iPhones breaking on me for no reason I have had zero issues with this phone This phone is easy to use Has a nice visible screen And functions like a laptop in your hand The edge features are nice and function well All the tools are easy to use and allow you to customize the phone in infinite ways to meet the users preferences Excellent phone if you dont already own a Galaxy S6 I love everything about this phonr Great product I we have 2galaxy phones 2 tablets 2 tvs a gear s and a gear vr we love our samsungs I came from a SSGS5 My primary reason was to seek out a phone with better battery performance There is so much to like about this phonejust improved technology all around than the SSGS5 Much better power management higher resolution display and 100 rock solid fingerprint reader and better camera And what I get that I didnt have before is wireless charging and Samsung Pay I have yet to run the battery down below 50 by the end of the day

My only complaint is that the phone is a slippery holdyou really need a case to provide some grip or this thing is going to eventually kiss the floor This is a great phone The pictures are amazing It has been easy to use The slim design makes it really comfortable to hold even with a gel case on The battery life is very good I have it in power saving mode and it has lasted for 2 days easily I do turn it off at night There are some features you cant use in power saving mode such as the always on feature for the time and date to always show I do like that feature so I may turn off power saver The phone brings things up very fast I can tell a big difference between this phone and my S4 with the speed The sound is very good People can hear me and I can hear them clearly I like the speaker being on the end of the phone instead of on the back You dont block the sound when you are holding it It charges fast I havent found any problems yet I really do love this hardware I feel like Im from the future when Im holding it Unfortunately I dont feel so futuristic when Im using it While many of the software features are great and the os is overall pretty stable the lack of fluidity can be fairly jarring Just today I had to restart the phone because it was exhibiting symptoms of a memory leak extreme lag and then apps like the keyboard closing and restarting while using them Also the fluidity of animations leaves a little more polish desired If Samsung were to just polish up the software a bit more I could comfortably say this is the best phone you can buy I love my S7 Edge I am definitely not a very tech savvy person I love how easily I learned to use this phone The features are awesome settings are easily accessible apps are abundant and run smoothly The battery life is phenomenal I get two full days on a charge and I play games and stream video Cant say enough about my Samsung S7 Edge the camera is out of this world by far the best camera phone ever Overall this is an amazing device Beautiful screen amazing camera solid performance and great battery life Only issue so far is the screen has 5 or 6 little scratches on it already and have only had the phone for a few weeks My previous phones never had a screen protector and I never had a screen get scratched from just having it in my pocket the phone is great battery life is awesome takes great pictures I love the phone because its really fast and responds really well I also like the bigger battery too and holds a longer charge I also love the always on feature too The sensor on the fingerprint scanner is impeccable its is so much faster compared to the Galaxy S6 It makes everything way more smooth and efficient The screen also is very clear and beautiful
I also long that its water resistant

The drawbacks I have is that I dont like the curved edges it kind of drives me crazy I have a glass screen protector on the phone and it cant go to the edges and I have slight OCD so it i cant help but stare at that issue and i hate it
Though the camera does take good photos and much better in low light I did prefer the 16 megapixels in the S6 over the 12 megapixels on the S7 The pictures are clear and very nice but the other phone you could see more detail But if i did have to choose I do prefer the S7 
The sound from the speaker isnt loud at all compared to the S6 its a world of a difference the S7 speaker is kind of weak 

Overall I love the phone very much I upgraded from a Note 4 to the S7 Edge and WOW am I glad I did I love my Samsung phones but this is one of the best phones I have ever owned and used I have previously owned the above phones and also an S3 

Me and my wife are also proud owners of 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab2s Love them love them 

Samsung you did it again 

Keep up the great work and you have a customer for life here in Michigan Greatest phone Ive ever owned hands down Camera is outstanding too Im a loyal Samsung fan Ive had most of the Galaxy series over the years I owned all of the Notes and each one got better and better I decided to go with the S7 Edge this year after doing my due diligence and Im very satisfied with my decision Now that expandable memory is back the design is flawless the S7 Edge is a well put together device and you feel it right away in your hand The resolution is amazing per usual but continues to improve every year The camera is hands down the best Ive ever seen on a smartphone and even is competitive with some of the lower end SLRs All of the features are intuitive and user friendly and the battery life is best yet for a Samsung I love this phone on every level and I highly recommend it you will be very impressed with the capabilities and limitless possibilities I went from an S5 to the S7 and I LOVE the phone Its so nice to hold the touch screen is so responsive Ive has all phones of the Galaxy serious except the 6 and Im glad I waited for the S7 My other favorite was the S2 I hadnt been too excited over the S34 or 5 but the S7 has impressed me the most The one thing I would love to see eventually with the Galaxy serious is something with the power as the 7 but smaller So Im coming from a Galaxy S4 for reference so while I cant give you an account for the gap between the S6 and the S7 I can at least tell you how much of a leap up this phone is from the S4

First thing I noticed right off the bat was the curved back that fits more ergonomically into my palm which is definitely more comfortable than the S4 sharper edges The fingerprint scanner on the HOME button is a nice little novelty that while making it quicker to unlock my phone is still annoying when attempting to position my thumb just so so Im glad that I can keep my old pattern as a backup

The bigger screen becomes most noticeable when playing some of my older games Its obvious that these games have to be stretched to accommodate this different screen resolution but Im sure theyll patch that in soon These are things to be expected from a phone that was just recently released Speaking of that subject I noticed a few other minor bugs that fit that category including not being able to post text in Facebook Messenger without opening it through the Facebook app weird

I am so grateful for the boost in storage space and general performance compared to the S4 Even without an SD card all my music and apps dont feel too cramped yet Though be sure Im going to be using the heck out of the expandable storage once I get my hands on a decent sized microSD 

Overall this phone is definitely a worthwhile upgrade if youve still got a phone from 2 years back Dont go for the S6 either The price youd have to splurge just for a more accommodating 64 GB size is about the same as the S7 anyways and that expandable storage is definitely worth the money Great smartphone a noticeable improvement over my old S4 Only had for a couple weeks now but battery lasts all day and runs fast with all my apps in the background usually 20 or more running Waiting on the VR gear to try that out Definetly recommend Love the galaxy s7 great battery life and outstanding features only used it since it came out and loved it since it came out it is by far one of the greatest smartphones on the market Im a Samsung addict I love all samsung phone and I really cant find anything to say bad about this phone today I finally put the battery to the test and Im amazed by its performance I took it off charge at 230am before work had Bluetooth on and was streaming audio all day long plus did messaging and a few lengthy phone calls and by the time I got home from work which was at 330pm I was only at 61 battery life Also I have the display light set to high Im a 100 thumbs up with this device This phone has it all Everything that I could ever want or need The camera is great It takes amazing pictures and the auto focus is so fast The size is perfect and the waterproof feature is like icing on the cake This is by far the best samsung phone I have ever owned I was using the note edge prior to this which I loved but I always want the newest phone so I got me the s7 Im glad I did This is a great phone with lots of great features One complaint would be weak plastic over the rear camera I have had a durable case on it from the first day Some how the plastic over the camera cracked this week only possible way was when my keys and phone were in same pocket The phone has every feature you can think of Vr capabilites phone quality battery life And once you add on water proof you just add another level I dont think I can find a feature this lacks that I want And with built in sync capabilities I can link my phone to other Samsung products and use it from there Simply amazing aND efficient Love the phone This phone is beyond anything I could ask for Its lightweight has great sound and everything is easy to use I even love samsung pay Great piece of tech  love the screen and the overall build pleasantly surprised at how well the edge screen performs Love the samsung pro audio and pay features too I really like the S7 with one exception The S7 is even faster than the S6 but I am disappointed with the photo quality The photo quality of the S6 was so much better in my opinion I know the S6 had a 16mp camera compared to the S7s 12mp But what a difference especially when you need to zoom in Im still learning some of the features But it seems like every time I accidentally touch the screen I learn something new The only thing that Im not fond of is how difficult it is to type on this device It seems as if Im always touching the sides I cant quite hit the q near the edge or my fingers are too big for the keys Im a petite female 
Other than that I have no issues Like very much all the new features Took a while to load all my stuff back in phone and figure it out but once I did I was happy Ive owned several Galaxy phones and by far this is the best one of the bunch Good job Samsung This is easily the best phone Ive ever owned It has a beautiful design and functions perfectly I have stuck with the Galaxy s phones since 4 and I have been happy really I think the only thing I would have liked to be different is the option of a 64g model your apps are pretty limited to the phones memory The 32 does seem to be doing fine for now being I can put all photos and movies on the sd card Ive been very pleased with the battery life and proformance The camera takes great pictures but I did think it was going to be a little better from the hype it was getting before release But I am coming from the s6 and that camera was already great in its own I also have a iPhone 6s and any time I try to compare the detail is better on s7 edge Battery life is good and the screen is bright even in full sun Sound quality is very good Best phone Ive ever owned battery life is amaxing The speed of the phone is great It feels lighter and thinner This phone is more than just a smartphoneits a GENIUS phone I had an S5 and it was the best phone I had ever had so for Samsung to improve upon that is absolutely genius My S7 Edge does everything I want it to do and more The Samsung Galaxy s7 edges phone has lively color  I absolutely love this phone But I am a huge fan of the Galaxy series It interacts easily with programs and apps Samsung has several interfaces to connect with just about everything Ive never found anything I want to do on my phone that I cant do That wasnt the case on other phones even ones very similar to the S4S7 Ive switched phones several times usually because I wanted the newest Samsung Galaxy S series out But was talked into other phones by my carrier Ive tried several of them now But I had some real issues with several of them The standard I was used to was just too high for them to meet Im back in the S series and lovin it The only con I have is the pricewhich is not really a con I guess I mean its about the same price as everything else out thereI just like it so much much improved battery life faster great photos in dim light fast charging Im glad there is no little door over the charging site to break off so easily  This has all the features you could want from a Samsung phone including the SD card slot and water resistance It is like the S5 and the S6 had a beautiful baby The only thing I have a complaint about is the front glass The bezel on the S7 makes it hard to get a screen protector to cover the whole screen I love the design and the battery life excellent well over my expectations for the phone speed is crazy fast This phone is really easy to use Easy to access all my apps contacts and any other thing Im looking for is right at your fingertips very well design just allaround awesome phone I have had several Samsung phones and without question this is by far the finest phone I have ever had The camera is phenomenal and so is everything else I am convinced that nothing can ever come close to this phone Love my S7 Flawless performance beautiful design What a great phone Love it All the new features r perfect a I thought my GS5 was an awesome phone and I was jealous when my wife got the GS6 When I first found out there was going to be a GS7 I began to look into seeing what the pros had to say about it The waterproof feature is a big plus for me seeing how I never know where I will be The GS7 will far exceed my needs and so far my expectations at the moment It should be the last phone I will ever need but knowing Samsung they will come out with a more attractive one in the near future The call quality clear screen and high end camera are most things I use I play a few games not much for social media but I do text The phone is easy to use and fits my hand just like a glove 

I couldnt wait to purchase the VR Gear and as soon as I did it blew my mind I was amazed at the 360 degree pictures and the video quality of videos I sat in the airport on layovers and watched movies for a couple hours and it took me away from the airport as if I were in a theatre somewhere 

The camera take the most intense pictures of any phone I have ever used or compared it too My daughter has the 6s and we compared pictures we took side by side and the GS7 blew it out of the water The detail in the GS7 pictures were crystal clear as opposed to 6ss inferior quality I felt it was very upsetting for my daughter who loves her phone Needless to say I had to texted her the picture I took so she could use it for her Facebook page 

I cant express in words the full extent of how I feel about this phone you just have to have one yourself and give it a spin I have been a big Samsung fan for years I have the tv and the camera and have bought the s2 s4 s5 and now the s7 While this incarnation is the best yet it is not wo its flaws The body is beautiful and the screen is great but both the front and the back pick up fingerprints very easily and smudge a lot The new slot for the sd card and sim card were initially good but subsequent use have proven them to be more of a headache When you go to take the sd card out the sim pretty much comes with it The slots for these tiny rectangles are not secured so pushing it back in can be difficult as well I am very glad that I didnt go wthe edge model because this is the first phone I have ever had where my hand hits the edge of the screen while entering text and accidentally pushes buttons usually the 0 since its in the upper right I imagine that the edge would have enhanced this problem
Other than that I am very happy with the phone It looks and feels much better than the s5 and is faster and has more storage There are a few features as well that make it superior but I dont know if they are Samsung or Android updates Overall I am very satisfied and anticipate using this device for a long time Coming from g4 this phone charges and holds charge about 500 better Im very happy with this phone is would recommend this phone to anyone and everyone Samsung stepped up their game from the S5 The S7 is a beautifully designed phone that performs very well This one easily stacks up well against the best of any other manufacturer The TouchWiz interface does not get in the way as it did in the S5 The later would sometimes freeze or stutter with no determinable reason other than the possibility it was TouchWiz In contrast the S7 is the smoothest experience yet treating Android well
The beautiful design comes at a cost The glass back makes you want to show it off however its probably best to put a case on it and keep it that way for protection The few times I have used it without the case the curved back was easy to hold and felt good
The screen looks great and although I wish it had more options to refine the color there is no real downside to the limited choices available
This phone is fast No longer am I waiting for something to happen Its happening when I want
The camera is amazing Very fast focus times and the image quality is the best
Cant wait for the Gear VR After a brief stint with 6splus I came back to galaxy with the s7 edge and couldnt be happier MICRO SD is back faster camera and the battery life is great I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 all the way to the S7 WOW The performance is obviously vastly improved but its the design I truly love It feels great in my palm when Im using it all day the sensitivity and curvature of the new touchscreen is amazing The sound is superb  robust I watch most of my programming on my phone now Of course I cannot complain about the water proofing the exquisite camera quality for both front and rear cameras Even the nuances of using the Galaxy design have been improved upon since the S4 such as its much harder to accidentally trigger the back button or power button when holding it in one hand Really excellent work on this design I upgraded from S4 to S7 just now and its been going great for me Really like that they brought back the water resistance and expandable storage features The S7 has a great battery life and is super fast Having Samsung pay is a huge plus as well The only issue I have had with this phone is all of the applications that come standard on it from Verizon that I needed to remove I am extremely happy with it Everything about this phone is amazing I only charge it over night and it lasts all day The cameras rock Great quality Fast clean great features works well and has great lines beautiful to look at and and easy to use This is by far the best cell phone that I have ever had I would recommend this to anybody who wants a nice cell phone Im writing this with speech to word and is it so far been 100 Compared to the s6 which I just upgraded from the battery life and fingerprint sensor are a lot better My Samsung S7 Edge not only looks stateoftheart but performs like a welloiled machine the Slick new design fits in your hand like a glove It has all the bells and whistles that you could ever want it is almost made me throw my laptop away with the added feature of gear S2 I am ready for anything thank Samsung for a wonderful working product I am going to enjoy it for months to come Just love how fast it is the camera is my favorite part of the phone love the live action love the quick focus The only problem is you cannot see your Skype contact status if on or off in your phone contact list as was with the S4 Even though your contacts are linked Just received the phone Have used it for a few hours and its really nice so far The Edge version  not available for Cricket  is a bit nicer and has a bigger screen 
This is still much faster and very responsive I like it for now and see how it holds up with the battery usage 
All in all its a nice phone The s7 is a lot better than the s5 was and I wouldnt trade back for anything Got the new Galaxy S7 Edge the first day it was available Battery lifeExceptional high user
DisplayExceptional 
FeaturesBest in any phone Ive had some far
Still learning all the things its capable of but so far I love it So far I have liked the phone It is real fast and stable I am having a little issue with the microSD chip going away and coming back 1 or 2 times per day I saw that appears to be something a lot of people are seeing

The display and camera are awesome I also like the 60 OS It has a lot of nice features 

One complaint is that the bottom left button used to be a menu button now it is a list of all the apps that are might be running in the background This broke a handful of apps that I have been using for years Love the camera Love the speed Love everything about my Samsung S7 I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to a Galaxy S7 Absolutely love the S7it is very fast outstanding screen very solid and perfect set of features waited for Samsung to bring back the microSD card option I left the iPhone at the iPhone 4 and have never looked back I have had galaxy phones ever since the S3 and this is the best phone so far i really liked the S6 but with the addition of the SD card slot and Waterproofing has made the phone better I use iphones for my job and have tested HTC phones and i will always use the galaxy line for my personal choice I tell everyone i know to go get this phone 
The Samsung S7 is the best phone in the world
High Performance Sexy Display Feature Rich 
everything you can ask for in a smartphone

Great job Samsung Youve got a lifetime customer I really love this phone Its the best phone Ive ever had Samsung has put together a quality product taking into account the need for expandable memory battery life and a functional sized screen to not make me squint when watching the ridiculous amount of media in the world As an owner of the SG4 i was really impressed by the S7 The camera is great the phone is fast  the battery is long lasting and the always on display is awesome Great phone This is my first Samsung phone as well as first time using Android I have been a long time iPhone user but decided it was time to try something new I will say that there are a lot of annoyances with the operating system that you just dont see on iOS If you can get past those then the system allows you do to a lot more than you could do on an iPhone The phone itself is pretty fast and seems to run everything I throw at it Its also an amazing looking device As far as aesthetics go its the best looking phone I have owned to date I have not tested the waterproof featured but there is peace of mind knowing that its there in case of an accident The Galaxy S7 Edge is such a beautiful phone I have been nothing but impressed with it since I got it I love the edges so sleek And the edge panels are great can access apps and more from anywhere Im glad Samsung went back to having memory cards Im not worried about which apps or photos to delete to make more room Touchwiz has even improved this go around Also the Edge doesnt feel like a 55 in screen phone I can use it comfortably with one hand Loving my new phone Nearly perfect in designThe Galaxy S7 Edge is truly a device worthy of praise  consideration Sleek  beautiful in design the S7  S7 Edge brings together nearly all of the specs I have pined for and many of those missing from the S6 Phenomenal performance from the Snapdragon 820  4gb RAM improved finger print reader return of waterproofing  microSDTHANK YOU Gorilla Glass 4 easy to hold than previous models due to improved ergonomics absolutely amazing camera performace from the 12 MP dual pixel with OIS feeding gorgeous images to the steller QHD screenMUCH improved battery life and all in a such a cafefully considered and beautiful design While I can admit to missing the usb 30 removable battery of my S5 I consider the larger battery  quick charge 20 a fair compromise in the S7 Edge Only the loss of IR blaster functionality tarnishes this otherwise glorious example of how a handset should be made Hopefully this will return with the Note 6 I have owned every Galaxy S handsetsave the S6 soo Thank you Samsung for returning microSD  waterproofing 6 months ago I got a note 5 loved it good features on the Note 5 until i got the s7 best upgradeI wood do it again It takes a little time to get used to typing on the Edge primarily those keys on the edge The power button is lower on the side than the S5 I was very impressed with the phone just regarding the features I had already known about But what really impressed me was finding out the things this phone can do that I didnt know about such as video call It is just awesome two of our children have iPhones and they brag about FaceTime But video call works just as well if not better super impressed In addition I had no idea how fast the camera was wow 30 shots in less than 2 seconds is just amazing I first used it seriously at my grandsons soccer game and it was phenomenal The picture quality is awesome and what can I say Im just impressed Call quality is as I expected textso are perfect bright screen great clarity if youre not impressed with this phone then I dont know what to tell you I am as I call mysel a Galaxy groupie ever since my GS3 and this phone exceeds all my expectations I bought the galaxy s7 as an upgrade from the s4 getting it out of the box the main difference between the 2 phones is they took away the removable battery not much else OS marshmallow seems like they went to simplify things now I just have to learn a new button set bup i am very happy to see you can use a memory card again I really like this smartphone though there are a couple of areas I would like improved The device handles any app I have used on it so far with ease Great resolution and clarity of the screen when watching videos or playing games 

The only drawbacks I find is that tends to get very warm almost to an uncomfortable level when doing any serious processing for any length of time After 510 minutes of playing a game with lots of stuff going on the phone gets warm enough that I have to stop and put the phone down to let it cool off 

The other drawback is that the actual phone function of the device isnt all that great I live in a low signal area with usually only 12 bars of signal on previous phones With this phone I am getting much less signal in places I previously had signal 

Even with these drawbacks I would still recommend this device to my friends I went from the galaxy s5 to the s7 and although I was skeptical on the s7 decided to take a chance and I absolutely love the design feel shape and performance of this phone The camera is fantastic and the accessibility of apps is great The memory on this phone is partially what made me make the purchase and Im extremely happy about it Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone to use easy to handle battery life is fantastic Experience great things with this phone photos are better I love this phone I came from a Galaxy S4 so I am really impressed It was very easy to transfer my apps pictures mp3s etc with the supplied adaptor which connects both phones through the micro USB port Also I did not have fast charge before so I think that is awesome and the processor is much faster so my apps execute very fast I am glad they brought back the option to put in an SD card as that was one reason I did not get a S6 I would have paid more for a 64g version if one was available though Received the Galaxy S7 and I will never use anothe brand again The camera is very crisp and clear Picture quality is as good as my dslr I bought this phone galaxy s7 edge couple weeks ago and felt in love with it it has great features great battery life very nice design it feels great in your hands I definitely recommend to anyone Good job SAMSUNG best phone ever If you are at all familiar with the Galaxy S6 series you would certainly be inclined to say that though drastically improved still left a desire for something more The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge filled the gaps that brought home the product for me

Two major features that were thrown to the wayside when the S6 was released expandable memory and water resistance have been reintroduced and in a refined manner The slim and sleek design of the S7 and S7 edge do what none other has accomplished making a beautiful device water resistant The addition of expandable memory is a return to what Samsung has offered us for so long that set it apart from the iPhone I feel that they truly listened to their customer base on this one and delivered on an extraordinary level Finally I can have a premium device and the memory expansion that I need for total control of my experience 

A slightly surprising adjustment to the device is the new camera At just 12 megapixels I presumed the device would underwhelming the previous experience with the 16 megapixel cameras Ive grown accustomed to However the redesigned pixel use and processor has continued to impress me under any lighting situation From low light to bright sun the camera continues to deliver extraordinary photos for those moments when you want to preserve time itself And adding a nice touch Samsung diminished the bevel almost completely to provide the thinnest device possible The front facing camera is a very nice camera adding the capability for video calling which was added directly to the dial pad interface A surprising touch

Battery life on this thing as is the case with most android devices is adequate at best It gets you by for a day but better have a charging cable handy just in case Samsung has the best solution for battery woes however in the name of power saving and ultra power saving modes Turn on the switch and easily extend battery life by hours or even days The only trade off is active sync 

All in all these devices are power houses to say the least They have far surpassed the expectations that I have set forth for them and then some The expanded capability of the edge functions make the edge more than just a fashion piece but a practical tool I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these devices to anyone After using the newest galaxy s7 I am very pleased with the upgrades and improvements on the already well designed galaxy phones The information transfer from my old galaxy to the s7 was fast and simple only 30 minutes for me to complete The speed and clarity make up the ideal candidate for anyone who wants to combine a camera a computer and a phone Very fast camera abilities with awesome clarity Running multiple apps is even better and faster The sound of the speaker has even changed for the better I am very satisfied so far with almost 1 month of usage What a great improvement over the S5 I love the feel of the phone light weight and easy to handle The performance and the features are much better then previous versions It is great My wife cant wait to get her upgrade So glad Samsung brought back expandable storage Its very convenient to store my photos and music without using internal storage The camera is awesome too love the feel of this phone especially like the quality of the glass the camera is particularly great The s7 is a huge improvement to the s6 and I like it much better than the iphones 
My biggest complaint so far is in trying to get a quality screen protector I like HD Ballistic glass protectors but they are not made to cover the whole screen due to the excessive curvature in the phones glass This really bugs me I love this phone I upgraded recently from a Note 4 this is a huge improvement Highly recommended It is fast and clean and the fast charging is a great feature Amazing solid performance and materials I highly recommend it I waited until the galaxy s series came back with the water resistance and micro SD card features before I wanted to upgrade This phone exceeded my already high expectations I have been a Samsung fan for years and this phone is the best thing they have come out with It is very well constructed and runs extremely smoothly The screen looks beautiful and the battery life is absolutely incredible It only dropped to 40 after 18 hours with the brightness all the way up using it every 20 min or so for 510 min playing games and checking social media I have the silver which I highly recommended Very pretty phone Keep it up Samsung I can get a new phone in 12 months Hope the next phone S8 or Note 6 is even better I like the performance  the camera its really great and the phone itself samsung always doin real good and quality equipment keep it up samsung Ive already recommended this phone to other people in my family and even a few strangers who admired the look This is my second galaxy an upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S4 and what an upgrades its been Ive been having a great time discovering and utilizing all the new features that have come with this device and I cant wait to sync it up with my Samsung Gear S2 when it comes Fantastic phone and Ive been using it as my primary example to sway my iPhone family over to greener pastures with Android Slick design sturdy right size and light weight The waterproof feature is a winner Overall you have the feeling that this is a superior device that you are proud to own The return of the external storage is certainly most welcomed and allowing most apps to be installed on the external storage is unprecedented If only it was possible to make the battery removable without compromising waterproof function this would have been the icing on the cake
On the software side there is less bloatware apps than before or at least they are now organized in groups such as ATT Google and Samsung making them less obstructive
One issue is the screen is that it is at times too sensitive causing inadvertent launching of apps Probably Samsung could come up with an enhancement to allow users to adjust the sensitivity So many great features on this phone Its ease of use is amazing Very cool features like waterproof and SD card slot The edge screen is a very cool feature All my friends ask about it This phone is really of the highest quality in every aspect Everything works as it should Highlights
Battery life is excellent With my old S5 I would use about 130 of its battery on a normal day with some light gaming and streaming music With the S7 the same behavior uses about 70 in a day Im sure I could stretch this phone out for several days if I really needed to 
Fingerprint reader works surprisingly well Actually faster than using a pattern Samsung Pay has actually been a great bonus as well 
Even with less megapixels the camera is much better than the S5 I took some short videos of some ducks swimming on a pond in the sun and it really seems like it is what Im actually observing 
The edge functionality is still a bit gimmicky but is a useful hotkey for shortcuts to your mostused apps 
I was worried about the phone being too big and in some respects it is but the edge keeps the width reasonable while still packing in all of that battery
The one CON Im genuinely disappointed about is that they took off the IR function to use it as a remote control That saved my life so many times when I couldnt find the remote This phone exceeds my expectations I came from the note 5 and was worried But all my worries are long gone  this is the first S series phone Ive ever owned always owned the note series and I can honestly say that I love this phone My second smart phone was the Galaxy S4 I have been in love with Samsung products ever since Their design durability features and promotions are fantastic I upgraded from the S5 to the S7 edge this month and wow the phone is awesome It took some getting use to the edge but I love it If you are looking for a do it all device with a great screen and graphics that is fast this is definitely the device to have I am looking forward to future Samsung devices The reason I say this is cause the flow is so smothyou can go from one action to the next so easy Love the new phone Need to focus on some bug fixes for the sound and video My phone doesnt always play my ring tones I have to rely on the vibration to tell me someone is calling when I restart the phone it will works properly Same thing with videos I get the something went wrong error on YouTube but after I restart my phone it works properly The only flaw I have with the design is it is too slippery my friend dropped his S7 Edge and shattered the display I dropped my S5 numerous times without a case and only chipped the plastic edges I am a huge Samsung guy and have everything Samsung and always will but I love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I love everything about it and its performance design and all of its amazing abilities The camera on this phone is almost better than my Canon DSLR Im glad I waited for the S7 coming from an S4 This is the second Galaxy that Ive owned and Im pleased with it so far

Its great that Samsung listened to its customers and brought back the removable storage So far Im very pleased with it

Unfortunately the bootloader is locked which certainly puts a damper on things Between Google Samsung and Verizon the phone has far too many aspects beyond the users control

GearVR is great although it cant be used with nonOculus apps such as those made for Google Cardboard

The GearVR has a screen door effect with the crazy magnification of the lenses The S7 display should have ample pixels to create a better picture even at 15 away

Every time I turn off my cellular data I have to hit a consent dialog Really How many times to I have to accept it Its so stupid Unless you use WiFi you will not be able to use Internet Really I never new that Ive only been using connected phones for half a decade that all comes as a real shock to me 

Every time I turn on my GPS I have to hit a consent dialog 

As much as the carrier wants you to run up your data bill and Google wants you to believe that having all of the radios on all of the time wont really run your battery down Let me turn those things off without having to root my phone

Theres an app that measures your pulse and blood oxygenation using the builtin light by the camera

Theres nothing that Im going to say here thats going to stop a person who wants one from getting one and convinces someone who didnt want one to get one The S7 appears to be a very good phone if not the best Android phone out there Im glad I waited and well see how this phone performs over the next two years The performance of the S7 is outstanding It performs exceptionally fast no lag times in anything It has such a sleek design as well very comfortable to hold I have found that this has an awesome camera takes awesome pictures The battery life is average and the water proof ability is great I have had issues with the c screen lock u no up unable to use closing buttons and volume buttons This phone has better battery life than the 6 an awesome phone is water proof and beautiful Seems as great as my S5 with a few extras and an Hd cameraReally good sound too Have owned the phone for a week now and I can say it meets all expectations Very solid construction with high quality materials The phone is a bit slippery without a case but I would prefer that over a plastic phone Best galaxy yet
Thanks for bringing back the memory cardand waterproofing I have been an Apple Loyalist since the iPhone came out I made a brief switch 2 weeks to the galaxy s5 and hated it went back to iPhone I recently traded in my 6S for the S7 Edge and i fell in love immediately Never would i think I would be a Samsung owner let alone one this happy 

The phone is beautiful the expandable memory and the flow in which the phone performs is awesome and I cant be happier There is obviously a learning curve however that is most of the fun 

The only downside I currently have is with the Battery which seems to be draining very fast but Im sure some tweaks to some network settings will fix that right up 

Great job on Converting me Samsung Love the clock and date on the lock screen that is always on 
I adore Samsung phones in general but especially have enjoyed the S7 
It takes great photos and sharp video 
It is easy to use though to be fair I have had a lot of practice with Samsung Galaxy phones having owned the S4S7
I love my phone This phone has it all Beautiful display great camera and amazing battery life This phone is definitely worth its weight in gold Its small enough that you dont feel like youre holing a book to your ear its snappy and I love the always on feature I love this phone It convinced me to switch from ipnone to samsung My only complaint is no IR blaster but it is nearly a perfect device otherwise Great performance camera and feel the phone works fine and Im happy with its performancebut at times it gets really hotwhen downloading or fastcharging wirelesslyI know this bad for the batterys life span so I dont use fast chargewhenever I restart it Ill get a messageprocess system isnt respondingwhats that Get rid of Touchwiz and give us faster updates to Googles OS and this phone would be perfect The best thing is you can install A SD card
The camera is great the picture quality is superb
The battery life is longer
The split screen is very helpful Ive had my Galaxy S7 for 2 weeks now and I have to say Im loving it The features are great So far the phone is properly speced for the feature set except for the battery Its fast and reliable I love the new camera The touchscreen display is the best Ive ever used The fingerprint reader is efficient and convenient And the new Samsung Pay is incredible Now all being said If you use the best of the features on this phone the battery will not last through the day with reasonable use I prefer to charge my phone nightly but if I have a few decent length phone calls and browse on my phone a fair bit then I will have to charge it at some point during the day Thank you for integrating wireless charging so a wireless charging pad on my desk keeps this from being a huge issue but the battery is a pretty important component to not underspec It does little good to have these awesome features if you cant use them without having a battery charger in your pocket Not a bad phone havent been able to utilize Samsung pay yet my bank doesnt support it but I have them looking into it The Galaxy S7 is everything a phone should be With the quick charge charger it takes a little over a hour to charge The camera including the inward camera is so crisp and clear It also does a moving pic that you can move thru to get that perfect moment The speaker is now on the side of the phone and so much louder than previous galaxy I purchased the phone earlier this month and cant seem to get enough The phone is slim and just beautiful I got the Samsung 7 edge in Gold Platinum Color is great The camera takes great quality pictures Overall this phone is great Its light weight Good camera quality Nice features I loved my S5 It had a removable battery SD card expandable storage and a great daylight camera But it did suffer from the typical complaints of its patrons low light pics and the camera protruded a bit too far When the S6 came out it lacked the sdcard storage and I heard battery life suffered Samsung fixed the flaws in the last two iterations of their Galaxy S line The camera takes great pics in daylight and low light the camera features are excellent it does not protrude too far but does still protrude ever so slightly the cam has a fast shudder the colors are vibrant but also very accurate the battery life is great it supports wireless charging natively it allows you to change the grid size on the screens 4x4 5x4etc to organize your app icons and regains SD card storage up too 200GB I believe The only coming I have is a recurring message popping up saying comsamsungfacetime is not available Im sure that bug will be fixed in a future update as others are seeing this as well Dont let that deter you from buying this phone Its an excellent improvement to the whole line and you wont be disappointed I like more memory
Its water resistant 
Wish it wasnt so expensive Ever since the S6 Edge I wanted an edge phone I got this one the day it came out and I love it a lot Its got a nice design the the curved edges Its just fire emoji I love the edge screen Im right handed works awesome when Im eating and I want to use my phone When carrying my kid I can use my phone edge screen and multi task I just got my galaxy s7 edge today and I love it It has so many wonderful features and I love the color and design Only is it the best mobile phone Ive ever owned its also got the best features and is the fastest phone on the market including phones that havent even come out yet

If youre lucky enough to find one in stock at any of the alterable stores that sell them I highly suggest you pick one up because they wont be in stock for very long

The only thing I have a slight drawback about is the extremely high price point but then again you get what you pay for I am over joyed with my phone Picture quality is amazing Ive had this phone for about 2 weeks already and I love it It was worth my upgrade Has a ton of features I love the new design that I am able to grip it my hands The gold color is amazing Is the best galaxy phone Ive had I love my gold galaxy s7 phone Its not a phone its Galaxy Overall I am very satisfied with the Galaxy S7 Ive had it for about 2 weeks now and so far Im pretty impressed 

There are some kinks however At one point I was experiencing issues with the power button and volume button working properly After looking online  I was able to fix the problem Outside of that minor glitch I have been rather satisfied with its performance Definitely a great investment This phone is the right size with the right amount of features Phones are starting to get to big picked the s7 over edge bc like smaller size 
works great 
design perfect 
quick I have been an iPhone user for last 5 years 
I can honestly say I have been tricked for the last 5 years 
This S7 edge is a BEAST Of a phone 
Am happy and thrilled to witness history with this S7 Edge and cant wait for the upcoming products still to come SAMSUNG YOU GOT IT RIGHT Pro

Cons
Bluetooth issues  
Unable to pair with multiple headsets Bluetooth turns off doesnt sync with Galaxy gear consistently 
WiFi issues
WiFi keeps dropping off and turning itself off WiFi signal poor WiFi speed issues The battery life is so beneficial compared to my last samsung note 3 phone Can go the whole day without charging So far I really like this product In still learning what all it can do I havent found a whole lot of information but Im still looking an learning I love my new phone The galaxy s7 edge is greati love all the features it looks cool in gold and goes great with the gear CR This phone is amazing super fast The camera is incredible and the screen is so clear Most of my friends who have iPhones want one Battery I life is good And its water resistant you can not go wrong with this phone its the best phone I have had and I have had a lot of phones I managed a cell phone store for 10 years Love Samsung WoW  Wireless  and fast  charging expandable storage amazing camera Beautiful display and great battery life Oh and the call quality is the best I have ever had This phone is powerful enough to handle split screen view and everything else I can throw at it
 As an added bonus being water resistant allows me to take it for an early morning run and not worry about an unexpected rain shower I love this phone  As a long time samsung customer i am constantly impressed by their tech The new galaxy s7 is a perfect example of their exceptional work i have a few samsung pieces in my home as well as well as having the old galaxy s4 which for the most part was a great phone as well it lasts 35 years and was definitely ready to retire but it held up through allot Ive had the s7 for about 2 weeks now and have tested out as much as possible all the claims Samsung promoted leading up to the release Its done perfectly Im not a brand follower necessarily but i love a great product when i see one Props to Samsung crew and all who continue to help make life enjoyable I am thus far satisfied with Samsung service and theven quality of the products Going in a better direction this device is at moment the best smartphone in the 2016 is an almost perfect device the only thing that is miss is that doesnt have the function for the tv remote but i say nothing will be close to this device I really love the s7 Great design just the right size the camera launches really fast and takes great pictures The only thing I think needs to be fixed is the amount of bloatware bundled by the carrier and by Samsung Huge improvement over the s5 Also the setup wizard constantly says that my phone is not activated even though I can make a call I have owned iPhones and the Galaxy Note and by far the Samsung S7 Edge is the best mobile phone I have bought The design is beautiful the display is amazing and the camera is awesome The battery life is a vast improvement as well Great funcinalitydesignevery good sound with RV works wonderful This phone is really great its super fast and has good features I like the edge panel you can slide over notification another great thing is being able to change the them I love this phone it is fast amazing camera does everything I need and everything I want By far the best phone I have ever had All the features are great and everything is easy to get to and use Battery life on this is incredible with such a short charge time The size and weight are just right This is the perfect phone for me Short and sweet  I love the new Galaxy S7 Edge with all of the updated features It has restored my faith in what an Androidbased large format phone can be The camera is terrific for the device class and the autofocus is very quick thank you

Never have been crazy about some of the preloaded appsadware but you can easily turn that stuff off

I would still like to see better performance out of the battery or just more battery  like 4000 mAh Turning many features off like LocationGPS and keeping the screen at 50 brightness the device still drops 510 battery per hour I even turn off the background sync for most of my apps where applicable Looking at the Battery page the only things using up more than 10 of the usage each are the Android system and related components On occasion Ill see Facebook and FB Messenger have used around 10 usage but thats about it

That said I have chargers and cables just about everywhere so I keep the phone topped off as much as possible I may invest in a batterycase at some point I upgraded to this phone from the Samsung Galaxy s4 The performance is astounding No lag whatsoever switching between apps or pages Everything is extremely smooth The ability to add a theme is something that I love Have used a different theme from day 1 Overall a great product and curved screen makes it even more beautiful This phone in its most is amazing but sometimes it gets a little slow after using several apps Besides that it is just amazing I started off with the gs2 I had the 346 and now the 7 I love how easy it is to operate these phones and the quality is like no other or there IPhone has nothing on galaxy Have had phone for 3 weeks now and I love it Compared to my Galaxy S5 I find the battery life to be better than I expected I see the difference in performance already and love the different settings with the edge display and finger print scanner I have been with Samsung for about 5 years now My first one was the Galaxy S2 then the Galaxy S4 then the S5 and now the S7 What can I say Im a loyal Galaxy lover This phone definitely meets all the expectations I had for it The screen is gorgeous the camera is excellent its fast its sleek brought back the waterresistant tech and SD card slot Everything I wanted The one and ONLY con I have for this phone is that it does not have the IR blaster I kinda liked that It was definitely useful and fun However definitely NOT a deal breaker at all I would recommend this phone to any android lover and I would push it towards any iPhone users Simply because I think everyone should go Android I love this phone it is fast reliable and takes awesome pictures the curve on the screen gets a little annoying when watching videos because I accidently touch the screen but otherwise awesome phone I love the phone It has lots of great features its fast also as great screen quality The one thing is the speaker I wish it had dual speakers for a little more volume Overall I love this phone So far I love everything about the S7 Edge The form factor is the best with this sized screen The battery life is fantastic Micro SD card slot and water proof are both features that are definitely welcome back Overall a great phone so far I love my new Galaxy S7 edge At first I wasnt going to purchase the Edge version but after using the edge features I have fallen in love When I receive a message from one of my favorites it lights up the side with their assign color At light the clock is displayed on the edge There is a quick links page on the edge that you just swipe sideways at any time and your favorite applications are right there to access I ordered the 32gb version and added 128gb micro sd card so now I have 160gb My entire music collection is on the phone which has over 9000 songs I still have plenty of space available The camera is so fast No delays and perfect picture quality What I really like is that the speaker is at the bottom of the phone and not on the back like my old Android device was located The final feature that I like is the water resistance No more bags of rice this phone is awesome I love the new game feature where you can record what your playing the battery lasts forever which is needed I love the gold color I would recommend this to anyone I moved fro iPhone to Samsung with some hesitation  but this an excellent phone with best design and no match camera I want sure initially if I wanted this phone but I decided to go out on a limb and try it since Ive never had a shiny new phone It had been well worth it This phone does everything right Blazing fast use beautiful screen stunning pictures amazing battery life You will not be disappointed in this phone I got the S7 Edge after having a S4 and I have to say that the difference is great One of the greatest features is the ability to expand your phones memory with an micro SD card I have always been a non Android user until I saw what this phone had to offer Waterproof Dusteproof Wireless Fast Charging And Marshmallow OS I love all the features and software and hardware has been flawless so far I have had this phone about 2 weeks now and would never go back I will be getting the S9 when my contract is up if it is anything like this phone Great job Samsung on the best phone ever Samsung products are the best never had any problems I love samsung product Im a phone geek n switch phones once every 36 months Or whenever a new phone comes out Ive owned plenty of galaxy phones n the s7 edge is the best Cant beat the expandable memory edge screen waterproof n the size is perfect for the hand I owned the nexus 6p before this phone n that phone was too big The s7 edge is perfect n fast Its a keeper for a while Maybe till the new note comes out  Fantastic phone Lightning fast I thought the S6 was fast but this thing is crazy Its beautiful with the edge and AMOLED screen Its water resistant has an always on display great camera  its just all around phenomenal

My only complaint if you would call it that is that the battery life could still be better Its much better than my S6 was and its not terrible but Id still LOVE to see it get me through a day of heavy use with no fears it would die before I was done with it As it stands it will last confidently about 75 of the day and then I find myself looking for a charger So much better but still some room for improvement there Fix this though and I think youd have the perfect phone  the perfect phone for me at least Its also a bit expensive in comparison to other modern flagships but I can somewhat understand this given that it is itself a feat of engineering This is a great phone compared with the Iphone 6 plus that I used to use The camera on this phone is amazing I love the fact this phone is water resistent because Im a mechanic Also the fast charging capability is awesome I can charge this phone in less than 30mins and will last for hours This galaxy s7 phone is fantastic The thin bezels and curved edges made the phone feel just like the iPhone 6s except the screen size is larger and better resolution Samsung pay beats apple pay easily without a fight since its acceptable nearly almost any where Lets face it most companies will not spend the money to upgrade for apple pay compatibility File transfer  manipulation is much easier and friendlier than itunes Total win Ive upgraded from many samsung phones The S3 to the S5 to the Note 4 and finally to the S7 This is my favorite one out of them The Marshmallow OS is different from Kit Kat obviously but it runs faster then the Note 4 and the fact that its smaller makes it easier to handle 

I havent tested the water resistant feature and I hope I never have to but thats a nice feature What brought me back to the Galaxy series was the memory card slot I hate storing stuff on my phone The S7 Edge is in one word magnificent love  the added features My family and I all have Samsung phones currently and have previously We love the Samsung brand and would and have recommend them to others Love my phone The style is so cool I like a bigger phone but not too big and this is the perfect size I love all the features its its a great phone takes a bit to get used to upgrading but I love it Hands down the best phone I have ever owned Beautiful design amazing camera fast processor accurate fingerprint scanner amazing battery life and on top of all of that its water resistant with expand let storage Mind Blowing Thank you for making a phone your consumers will actually fall in love with I love this phone Samsung really goes above and beyond customer expectations when coming out with new devices I will most definitely be a Samsung customer for life I finally have a phone that will last the whole day Best phone ever much better than s5 best camera awesome edge screen and best features I love the phone Have nothing bad to say Would recommend to all my friends I have always loved the galaxy line of from Samsung I had the Galaxy s5 before the Galaxy s7 and it was worth it The Galaxy s7 is truly amazing in every way From the beautiful design the amazing feel of the glass and the nice metal edges The phone in my point of view is one of the best smartphones ever I love so many things about this phone Ive had it just a couple weeks so far I went from S4 to S7 so of course that is a noticeable increase in features and performance I really liked my S4 but the difference in additional performance and battery life is a definite bonus Well done Samsung great build blazing fast and an SD slot Thank you and your team for delivering an outstanding product Ive been a loyal Samsung Galaxy customer from the beginning I recently upgraded form the S4 and love the new S7 Great syling great peformance and the battery is amazing I love the wireless charging as well Im very happy they brought back the SDcard capablility My wife has an S6 and its frustrating not having the additional storage Best overall phone out The new camera is absolutely amazing and has been my favorite part of my Edge 7 Not to mention showing people the water resistance has been fun when they are not expecting it Thank you Samsung for bringing back expandable memory too Samsung everything I love my new s7 Samsung products will be all that I buy the camera is absolutely stunning the device is extremely fast amazing graphics This phone is a must buy I really dont have many words but that Ive had Galaxy phones for a while The biggest thing that I like about this phone is its new easy feel design as well as of course the battery and speed By far the best phone exchange Ive had This phone is really fast and has great battery life also a lot of cool features its an amazing upgrade I had the S5 prior to the S7 and even though you cant remove the battery the battery life is amazing i love my edge screen and the shortcuts that come with it and all the advances features that come with the phone are amazing the only down side with the edge screen is if you use your phone while laying down your thumbs tend to touch the screen if thee is no case on the phone but with the case your thumbs get to rest on the material of the case The phone is absolutely amazing one of the best phones I have ever had  actually it is the best phone I have ever had The one thing that i miss from my Galaxy S6 Active is the Peel Smart Remote Quality product Beautiful display and great for low light pictures Loved being able to add the sd mirco card for more storage Paired easily with bluetooth headphones Love everything about this phone I havent bought a new phone in 5 years so Im a bit biased But this phone is a great upgrade for me Most times a new phone comes out I wait and wait for all the bugs to be worked out and the hype to be over When I saw the specs for the s7 I truly knew I had to jump on it as an upgrade from my s5 I waited over 2 years to upgrade my phone and couldnt be happier with my decision to get the Samsung Galaxy S7 The Galaxy S7 Edge is absolutely fantastic I rely heavily on my smartphones to keep me active in my business and the GS7 Edge has not disappointed in ANY way thus far My battery life is well above anything Ive used previously I go to bed after a full day of use including heavy web use videos etc but no games with over 50 of my battery life remaining The Camera is spectacular I do some photography professional for events and occasional headshots and video work The camera on this beat the shots I took with my midrange DSLR The darker areas of the events were clear and in focus without much work The video capture is incredible as well I dont think Ill be replacing my DSLR with it but itll certainly be on set with me for those extra shots when I need something quick in focus and to the point 

The overall experience has been beautiful elegant fast and consistent Thanks for a great phone Samsung Its battery lasts a long time It performs really well and is perfect for what I need it to do Im able to talk to my friends and it has a better connection than any other phone Ive used Snappy bright great speakerphone waterproof design huge battery the best of the S5 and S6 combined I absolutely love my GS7 By far the best phone Ive owned Picture quality is phenomenal I like that the battery lasts longer than my GS6 Samsung continues to lead the markeyt in innovation and tech savvy The new galaxy 7 continues their dominance in the market the only phone I will own Best phone that Samsung has made yet and I have had most of them BUT with the new software the 601 Im thinking because it is new it is a little bit buggy Such as freezing force closing of apps I did not have this problem on my S6 Edge WHEN you guys come out with an update that fixes this and I know you will this phone will be the best phone EVER made KEEP IT UP SAMSUNG Im coming from iPhone and this phone is faster better looking and I love that you can expand the memory This phone is water resistant as wellall I have to say is this is the best phone Ive ever owned Love android as wellSamsung and Android work well together Great job Samsung I absolutely love this phone Its a very powerful device for a great price The display is awesome very bright and vibrant colors The camera is fantastic very high quality and no major issues I also love that they brought back the waterproofing and the expandable memory both were huge things that I missed with the S6 Overall a great phone with some awesome improvements This cellphone is really good the only problem is the battery If you are a person who need to work with it all the time or u are going somewhere and you are gonna take a lot of pictures make sure to take your portable charger with you The camera is amazing  And it has amazing and useful features
The speakers are amazing and the sounds are really clear 
Over all I recommend this cellphone Great design and very easy to understand and operate most features already exist within older models so you dont need to relearn how to operate the device the battery life is being great with almost 24 hour constant use and the wireless charging feature is so convenient no wires to worry about if picking it up in a hurry The only thing is the speaker not being loud enough when I play music at work other than that a great product and a fine investment I wont regret I waited a long time for the S7 Edge and I am thrilled I came down in size from the Note4 but its a perfect fit its slim enough to fit in my suit or pants its everything I need and more sorry fruit people  Its just amazing fast battery last longer than the Note Edge that I had before is simply and amazing machine I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE Really feeling the edge screen It helps you prevent your home screen from being too cluttered and searching for your most used apps Love the lightweight and size but terrified of dropping it due to the screen being easily breakable Still exploring the wide variety of features it has but loving them so far My favorite thing is the split screen feature and how great the engine works running multiple apps Having trouble connecting to car though Love phone for all the capabiltyexcept no ir and design that less than overwhelming Easy to setup and you can literally do anything with this phone Could be handled in one hand and a sleek look makes it look good I am still learning all the features this phone has to offer I do like Samsung Pay and have used it several times so far Its thin and sleek but I recommend a cover because it can be a little slippery I had the S5  loved it But I strayed from Samsung with a different brand Happy to say Im back I loved my 6 edge Now my 7 edge what can I say here is my review its like 1 inch biger than edge 6 and iPhone 6s better camera screen more apps on edge screen water resistantbigger battery  longer time to chat stream surf the web text and talk now has a direct tv Remote control  thebest and onlyone  This product is very well designed The water resistant features are a must have for every occasion Of course it is not meant for you to be going swimming with it but in every day circumstances it is perfect Also the edge design is great if you just want to check the news or updates and its customizable A draw back to the design is the battery life The battery seems to not last very long wish it lasted longer Otherwise it is durable lightweight and the apps are wonderful I love it Easy to use and get use to Even the inexperienced galaxy person can operate this phone with ease I am very please with my new Galaxy S7 Is packed with great features is fast its clarity is amazing great design and love the camera Job well done Samsung with this new device This phone delivers everything it promised and then some My friends said Wow the display is like watching a TV I was upgrading from a Galaxy S4 and the transfer of data was virtually seamless Samsung did its homework and the phone upgrades all the if onlys you can think of and having that card slot for my memory card was the icing on the cake Bam there were all my pictures videos and music Not having to agonize over how much memory to get in the model I chose was another plus since the S7 only comes in 32 G with the additional card slot Thank you Samsung for delivering a superior product I am honestly surprised with this phone I came from using a windows phone and switched to iPhone Not a fan so I switched to android but I was a little wary of it I am really enjoying this phone Samsung won a customer When I was debating on getting the phone I looked at reviews online and from what I saw was great Then when I actually picked up my phone that day I had realized that I has got myself into something big This phone is way more extravagant that what I saw online The S7 edge has so many features that online bloggers and vloggers left out The camera is down right ridiculous The quality of each picture I take makes me feel like Im a professional photographer The phone in general is just amazing I cant stop talking about it Its way better than any Iphone Samsung if you read this I just want to let you know that you nailed it once again CONGRATS This phone is fast and easy to use I love everything about it I can keep going on and on about it that is how great this phone is Thank you Samsung for not disappointing me I have the phone now for 3 weeks So far I have been very happy with my purchase The only negative that Ive come across so far is that the battery life does not seem to last very long Im not a very heavy use so I feel like I should get a little more life out of a new phone Other than that I think the features are great and the phones performance is excellent Its got a great sleek design and Im thrilled that they brought back the SD card slot Very stylish sleek design I love the water resistance and fast charge features I love this phone Best so far Best picture on a mobile device Great security for a mobile device I love how my Galaxy S7 edge works so well with my Samsung products like my curved HD Samsung TV my Gear S and Gear S2 my Level U Pro Bluetooth ear phones and chargers Its delectable technology 
Oh let me not forget my amazing Occlus VR Its a game changer I have loved the S7 I am glad that Samsung figured out that we wanted the SD card option back Hopefully the removable batter will come back in the next generation 

It is very stylish and fits well in my hand It is very smooth and free flowing both inside and out Its a galaxy I switched from an iPhone to this device and Im not looking back Phone is fast and smooth Improvements in app operations and streamlined operations Good job Samsung Love the Galaxy line Ive had them all but the speed and display of the 7 surpassed them all I was a little disappointed when I found out that the camera was going to be loosing mega pixels but I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome pictures it takes Ive had the phone for a few weeks and so far it just keeps getting better This phone is the perfect size for the guys who like to carry it with them Love the camera quliaty
and the fast charging time I have a a micro card inserted for more memoryGreat addition Water proof from my beers spillsLOL
I would recommend this to all of you phone lovers I come from a note 3  and since its a note it has a couple of feature that the s7 but to be honest i dont really miss them i do everithing i did with the note 3 and s7 display and camera are off the grid grate product  cant wait to see whats coming for the note 6 looking foward to its launch I love that water proof I love how easy to work it all the features are awesome the camera picture come out beautiful Google voice isnt working Ive had to retrain it several times keeps getting incredibly hot when its charging Good design but the volume and power buttons are at the opossite side of tne phone Most of the time when you press one button holding the phone with one hand the other side button is pressed too This is really the best Galaxy so far Love how fast it is and the graphics are awesome I have had nothing but galaxys for some time now and the S7 didnt disappoint I absolutely love this phone and would highly recommend it The new s7 feel soon good in the hands and that they brought back the micro SD card back was an awesome move go samsung Great phone Really glad Samsung went back to allowing the micro SD card for additional storage on the new S7 I like the simple style of it I Am usually a Samsung note person but I am very impressed with the s7 edge from detailing of it to the specs to even the color Thank you samsung for another exceptional product I upgraded to this phone from a S4 This was a major upgrade even though I lost the removable battery and IR blaster I kept microSD card support and gained water resistance One thing that I dont like is the level of difficulty involved in repair of items that could fail on the phone ie battery screen charging port etc I personally repaired the screen on my S4 at least 4 times including the digitizer as well one time This is much more difficult on the S7 The battery life on this phone hasnt impressed me yet either The phone has always made it through the day for me but sometimes it will barely make it to 930 or 10 PM From the battery stats screen android system and android OS are the culprits with the most battery usage which tells me that perhaps a software upgrade could improve battery life The screen colors look great the camera comes up quick and focuses even quicker Samsung pay works well I love being able to take the phone in the shower and listen to music the always on display works well and is handy performance and multitasking works very well and call quality is top notch especially HD voice All in all Im happy with this phone I know that no phone is perfect and I think this is the best phone on the market currently which is why I chose to upgrade from my trusty S4 I cant believe all the great features on this phone I needed a new phone so I could accomplish more work while I was taking care of my newborn baby The size was the first thing that worked great for me it fits perfectly in one hand The great multitasking features From the edge bar that you can personalize to have quick access to all your most used apps and websites to the drag and drop feature
Not to mention that it is water resistant and with little ones around that is always a good idea Being able to silence the phone just by flipping it over is amazing and makes my life as a working mom that much easier I upgraded to this phone from a S4 This was a major upgrade even though I lost the removable battery and IR blaster I kept microSD card support and gained water resistance One thing that I dont like is the level of difficulty involved in repair of items that could fail on the phone ie battery screen charging port etc I personally repaired the screen on my S4 at least 4 times including the digitizer as well one time This is much more difficult on the S7 The battery life on this phone hasnt impressed me yet either The phone has always made it through the day for me but sometimes it will barely make it to 930 or 10 PM From the battery stats screen android system and android OS are the culprits with the most battery usage which tells me that perhaps a software upgrade could improve battery life The screen colors look great the camera comes up quick and focuses even quicker Samsung pay works well I love being able to take the phone in the shower and listen to music the always on display works well and is handy performance and multitasking works very well and call quality is top notch especially HD voice All in all Im happy with this phone I know that no phone is perfect and I think this is the best phone on the market currently which is why I chose to upgrade from my trusty S4 im pretty happy with this phone all the way around im still getting use to the volume buttons being on the left side rather then on the right side of the phone with the power button but that is really not a big deal everything else on the phone makes up for it
even tho the camera isnt as high of mega pixels as others its still a pretty great camera able to take really nice pictures with it I like how easy it is to use 
the battery might not be as big as some of the others phones you see but im still blown away with the battery life on this phone Im pretty impressed  I use my phone heavily through out the day everything from google maps to playing music to facebooking and surfing the web texting and talking on the phone
and I can get about full 7 hours befor I have to charge 

I like the fact that its not a real big bulky phone 

not sure what else to add just all around a great phone
great job Samsung I swear by Samsung because of the great work they do pros

cons
software
bloatware
carrier modifications Ive had the s4 for the last few years and decided to upgrade Quite expensive upgrade with new features that I do not really use I signed up to also receive the VR gear which I have yet to receive which is a bummer I mean the phone is nice and shiny and the camera is faster and much more clear But the edge part is annoying because i tend to touch it without knowledge and it goes on to do other stuff New curved sides makes it easier to handle with smaller hands Battery life cannot compare to any one currently on the market Easy to read with same Android reliability I upgraded this phone from an S6 before that was an Obama Lifeline phone I love everything about this phone The ease of getting into my music apps when its time to to go its small and yet it gives an option to change it over to 1 handed use So many themes imy still finding out the wonderful things this phone does I wouldnt be surprised if it cooked my bacon in the morning This phone is beautiful and it feels amazing in the hands and has the best camera ever Impressive Accessories such as the gear vr are not comparable to anything else a must have I have used several of the Galaxy devices and the Galaxy S7 Edge is top of the class in the devices The curved display is a very elegant and a very useful tool to use in that phone every day Battery life is amazing and gets me through my day If I need a quick charge the fast charging capabilites gets me back into the rest of my day quickly This phone was an amazing update from the S4 I like the durability Look I have had a Samsung galaxy phone since the first iteration I have always been pleased with the build of my phone In recent years I went from the S5 to the Note 4 and then to the Note 5 I was disappointed with the Note 5 due to limitations to memory and the exclusion of water resistance to both the Note 4 and 5

That being said

Welcome back Samsung I recently bough the 7 Edge and what an amazing phone it is It is snappy responsive and absolutely look gorgeous Thus far it has taken everything I have thrown at it and worked wonderfully In past years I lived with the power save mode on to maximize my long days and turning off both Location services and NFC I have not done that and I regularly get a full 12 hours out of my phone with moderate to heavy use

The one area of concern I have is between Samsung and Google themselves So many of the apps are duplicate apps that essentially perform the same function such as Android and Samsung Pay It would be nice to get this worked out to where one app will do all that is needed This phone has everything you expect and more With amazing features incredible camera and OLED display Longest battery life and great VR features Working in harsh environment this device keeps the dust and water out Definitely recommend a bumper case I preordered my Galaxy S7 Edge and Im so happy I did I love my phone and its absolutely the best Android phone ever I love Android my first was the G2 by TMobile My only problem is that Samsung got rid of the home screen being able to carousel Considering its a miniscule problem I still love it and I havent even noticed My favorite is the edge screen Great phone so far Battery life has greatly improved over the S6 
Curved back makes holding the phone easier
Very quick and responsive
The SD card slot is back
Water resistance is nice to have as well

I recommend putting a case on it as it kind of hard to hang on to without one great phone just needs some patching to smooth out some minor bugs but runs great otherwise Great features and design Userfriendly Performs above expectations Shattered the BACK of the phone Only took about an hour Laid it on the desk at work was a paper clip under it WHY DOES IT HAVE A GLASS BACK Last galaxy for me if something does not change The best smartphone in the world right now

Beautiful screen
Great feel
Super camera I like how fast and easy this phone is to use I also find the battery life to be an unexpected bonus The battery is hard to kil in a day on moderate use I switch from a Iphone and absolutely love this phone The performance is outstanding and the picture quality is unmatched You will have a Samsung user for life Granted I did not get the Galaxy 5 or 6 and went from the Galaxy 4 to Galaxy 7 because they brought back the SD card I absolutely love the phone The phone is super responsive and the camera takes some of the best pictures around My first Samsung Galaxy S5 sold me on Samsung quality The S7 is no exception There are so many continuing and new features I could not list them all My favorite first of all is the high definition 12 mp camera on this phone The camera takes wonderful true to life color pictures I have a new granddaughter and the quick camera burst shot feature is wonderful for catching those once in a lifetime photos The low light feature makes it impossible to not get a great shot anytime Samsung raised the front camera to 5mp to make it great for those selfies with my granddaughter and video calling with my family The additional Micro SD storage feature will make sure I never run out of room for my pictures videos movies etc Like I said too many features to mention Oh quick charge is awesome Trusted sites is great too so you dont have to keep entering your password I could go on but I am out of room Buy this phone you will never regret it  Great features With the curved back it fits perfectly in the hand Lots of additional apps to personalize the phone Awesome camera Much faster auto focus and amazing for taking pictures at night Its water resistant I love that Samsung brought back the memory card slot Awesome phone I love it I really love the camera takes great pictures never blury Im not going to repeat what everyone else says and mention all the positives and go into details Water resistant sleek high end device with great performance Awesome screen and huge battery We all know this My problem is the unoptimized battery AOSP google nexus devices with new marshmallow draw about 1 an hour if not less while on doze and not being used Android system draws barely any power This is the app that runs all the background services which include all samsung system services like KNOX Samsung Pay Samsung MirrorLink and everything else Without optimization this runs at about 3040 on 2 S7 Edge phones we own in this household On a Nexus device its maybe at 5 top It took 1300mah on my wifes phone when I looked at 60 with not alot of screen on time This is HORRIBLE I had to do many tweaking to bring mine to less than 20 If this was caught in testing or fixed before launch our phone battery would last almost twice as long Doze also doesnt work properly and will keep the phone awake even when dozing This isnt supposed to happen Its supposed to force non messaging apps in sleep mode during doze with a short turn on to pull notifications and shut it back off

Im very dissapointed in this and really defeats the purpose of having a big battery This isnt just me either on a highly known phone forum there is a 1000 post thread on this issue with many other upset users

Just look at your phone and see in battery under settings what is 1 battery eater I guarantee its android system if you own a S7 If you have a non samsung phone it will be nowhere near the top

I uploaded two pictures showing what android system draws on a samsung phone versus what a AOSP naked google marshmallow draws Its very disappointing Its software related so I hope its fixed in a nearby update I use this S7 for my Electricall business and keep all info and receipts in Evernote so the camera quality is a must It is great 
I download schematics and store on this S7 so the 200 GB SD card is a Gods send
The email program makes it so easy to move delete send forward attach or reply 
I had an IPhone 2 Samsungs ago wouldnt trade a Samsung for 3 IPhones Great phone a little upsetting they got rid of the ir but still really nice phone I have used it for a week its so helpfulfast for every application to open Definitly recommendedGreat Job Samsung Im loyal to you Dont get me wrong I love the phone but not more than I loved my S4 There are only 2 things that made me upgrade and they were the better camera and more space The only thing I would really like on a phone this size is the ability to use a pen stylus with it like you can with the Note or the new iPad 
Batter life is good Im still getting use to the new calling features and messaging on the phone After using a windows phone for the last two years I decided to switch back to an android As it turns out I went with the Galaxy s7 edge and boy am I glad I did For the first time in two years I was able to do a lot of things I couldnt do with the windows phone Simply being able to read my Google mail which is something I couldnt do is enough to make me happy Thank you Samsung for another great product I love the phone and I am glad Samsung built in the option to expand memory but wish they had kept the iR feature the S6 had That is about the only thing I can say negative about it If you get one of these you have to get the VR head set too It is really great First off I am very upset that they didnt had this phone in white So I settle for a black one The only reason why I upgraded to this phone is because my GS5 was messing up big time otherwise I would of waited for another phone perhaps the Gs7

This phones performance is great I love the speed of things it has yet to give me a problem as in freezing and stuff which is great I do however hate that if im touching a little bit of the screen when trying to take a picture it wont take it  its very hard to not touch the screen since the edges are part of the screen 
Another issue I have is that it minimizes the screen when I dont want it too like if Im just scrolling through fbk it will randomly make my screen small but when I want to make it small it takes a few trues to get it done Another thing I have a problem with is that I cant take out the battery which is something I used to love from my s5 because I hate charging my phone   the speaker omg I hate it I really do my finger tends to block it  its annoying I like it better in the back of the phone like once again my GS5 

Im very have that it has the expandable memory I like the way the pictures come out the Camara is amazing  I like that I can change my themes as in my icons  stuff  I really like that I can have my top 5 people on the edge I wish the edge was more like the note edge tho that would of been great I like that this phone is very light  durable I have a kid and let me tell you it comes in handy to have a durable phone  Overall I like it but I would do some changes to it if I could Its a great phone it just takes sometime getting used to it This device is hands down the best device I have ever had the pleasure of owning Their are not many words I can say that would justify how great this phone is So let me just say Bravo Samsung Bravo Its awesomebattery life is great Features are great I love this phone Upgraded from the galaxy S5 and wow is all i can say It just felt right holding the S7 in my hand it was like a glove that fit perfectly with just the right amount of room for my thumb to move graciously across its sleek and slender display The features are amazing and i am amazed by the amount of customization can be done to suit each user type The perfect phone Amazing you never let me down samsung My best friend is an absolute Apple  iPhone fanboy After playing with my new S7 for 20 min he went out and bought one for himself  its that much better than the best competition This phone is super fast and love the color and weight of the phone It has a super sleek design would recommend this phone to anyone I have been very satisfied with my new samsung galaxy s7 edge Great features The phone is a step up from last years While I am not sure why it was only limited to 32gb for all carriers the phone rocks Bringing back the SD card slot was a good choice on their part Adding in waterproofing was icing on the cake Always feared answering the phone right after the shower I ruined many ear pieces doing that Speed and fluidity of marshmallow is great Battery life is good but I wish it was better I am still trying to figure out what is causing my drain The battery setting says its the Android System that is taking up most of the power but I dont know if that is something I can fix Time to check the forums If you are on the fence about whether or not to get this I would say go for it You wont be sorry

PSwireless fast charging is a nice bonus if you can find a case that will allow the wireless charge to go though So far it has been trial and error I own multiple Samsung products phones tablets cameras and love them all great quality and value The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an impeccable sleek and durable phone The curves on the back of the phone fit perfectly in my hand and one handed use is as easy as could be The fingerprint sensor is extremely fast and comfortable also The display is breathtaking and the colors are indescribable not to mention the highly impressive quality of the camera that brings out every detail and color that any of my recent phones couldnt The expandable storage is an excellent feature to bring back and that is 13 of the reason why I bought the Galaxy Overall this phone is an amazing advancement in technology and I will definitely be staying with Samsung in the years ahead I recently switched carriers for business reasons and replaced my Galaxy Note 5 with a S7 Edge For the most part Im happy with the decision The S7 Edge is an extremely attractive well built device as was the Note 5 but I feel like the Note was a bit easier to work with I tend to touch the sides of the Edge display with the side of my hand and need to be more careful when typing But from a pure performance and display standpoint there is no difference I chose the Edge hoping it will get one additional Android update beyond what the Note received I also believe the low light camera performance is slightly better When choosing either the Note 5 or the S7 Edge you cant go wrong These are the two best Android phones on the market today My photos are so vibrant and crisp I no longer carry my camera with me for the must take photos moments and Im not referencing selfies Great zoom and lighting features Ive also gotten attached to the Samsung pay feature Much better than android pay I have many Samsung products and love them all I look forward to each new product for their innovative ideas yet easy to use features Forever a fan The best feature is the slim smooth look I also have the no worry about water now that I have a water proof phone rain no worries mate I love my S7 edge It is great However there is still lag HOW Song my Nexus 6 for the S7 Edge and there are stutters that are just not there on stock android Still love it though Feels great in the hand SO SLIPPERY though It slipped out of my pocket and scratched the edges Also I still dont have my gear vr I am getting my Rift before my gear vr and the gear vr was supposed to help me wait for my Rift Oh well I guess The waterproofing battery life and size were what sold me as well as the increased specs and Quick Charge 

Pros
SD card
waterproofing
fingerprint scanner
newest chipset
camera is excellent
battery life is good but not great would trade thicker for more maH
 
Cons 
no IR blaster Small thing but dearly missed 
slippery I dont know what most people think about the whole metal and glass thing but I would really rather that the phone were more durable rather than more pretty At the end of the day my phone needs to be intact to do its job so I would even opt for an allmetal enclosure if it were more durable
not a huge fan of some of the TouchWiz menus for example I much preferred the Share interface from the LG G3 
speaker is still on the bottom sometimes gets covered by my hands when watching something in landscape would have preferred frontfacing Love itfastersmarteran a lot of features to keep your busy I upgraded from the Samsung S5 and this S7 blows that away Great upgrade option for anyone Absolutely love this phone It was very user friendly and easy to set up and figure out Very light weight compared to some of the smart phones Love the thin design and just being able to swipe the edge to get to where you want to go This is my third round of Galaxy phonesS4 S5 and now the S7 I have loved them all and this one is no different I love the Rose Gold color although it is a finger print magnet I still LOVE it and I love that it is easy to use Everything I need is easily accessible and customer service is readily available when I have had questions I would recommend this phone to everyonein fact my boyfriend just switched from an iphone to an S7  good quality with many options
takes great pictures out of the box i liked how great it felt i liked the features especially the ability to transfer your data from one phone to another via the cable attachment the camera is very crisp and records and takes pics very well my only complaint is the back of the phone in which its really slick and if you dont have good grip it will slide out of your hands other than that i like everything about the phone and not much has changedalthough i upgraded from a galaxy s3 very little has changed except for things like samsung pay and the fingerprint recognition as well as some button positions it wasnt hard getting things to where i had them on my previous phone and very satisfied with my product This is the best phone I have owned yet And that is coming from a previous iPhone 6s Plus owner LOVE my new S7 edge Miles beyond iPhone Will never go back I love my S7 only thing is Ive been a galaxy note fan so getting this is super small So waiting on galaxy note to come out this year but overall this phone besides being too small fast SD card excellent camera n fast Also wiping your phone down not worrying about it getting wet excellent and not worrying in rain amazing features Thank you Samsung for an amazing phone and gift promotions when purchasing so fun I dont regret getting this phone I moved from the Galaxy s4 to the Galaxy s7 and it was worth it The screen shape with slight curve makes all of the apps more functional There are many oneclick shortcuts that are new as well I love that they say its more water resistant but I hope not to test it anytime soon A whole lot faster than my s5 My only issue is the keyboard is not as sensitive as my s5 I have been using Samsung Galaxy devices from yeats now Before S7 I had S5 and S3 
Main reason for choosing S7 was its high performance and water resistant Along with it I also like its design  By design S7 is best of all smartphones I use My Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone I am completely satisfied with the look of it It is so sleek and the new gold color is so bright The battery doesnt run down like my last one It definitely seems to last all day and then some This is the device that brought me back to same Samsung Love my Edge Great screen solid battery life loud enough speaker The improvements to the edge display is awesome as well Great well rounded phone and you can expand the memory to boot If I had to say anything about this phone that I dont like is that you have to take it to a certified person to get the battery replaced if needed Thats the main reason some of our family members stop buying the IPhone I myself have been a Samsung customer for many years now I finally decided to let go of my Note3 and get the new S7 Edge since its basically water proof Incredible phonewith an awesome camera and highlights are remarkablelove every spec of it Well I spent the money  got my Galaxy S7 I love it  would recommend it to anyone I especially love the camera  its features It takes wonderful clear  detailed photosvideos 5 stars from me The price was decent  it has so many functions I started with the Galaxy S2  would never get another type of phone   This phone has one severe issue that trumps all of the good points of this phone and that is a WiFi issue
There are a lot of reports of the WiFi not working when the Bluetooth is on but my experience is even worse
My WiFi data speed is slower then dialup modem speeds And if WiFi is on it slows the 4G LTE speeds to 1G speeds 
This is not just one phone I had a preorder that was returned only to find the second phone had a identical issue I have done all of the uninstall reinstall The factory resets Tried different WiFi networks And WiFi will not work correctly and it brings LTE to its knees Im so in love with my Samsung Galaxy 7 Next will be the tablet samsung is better than apple becouse they have more style Ive owned my Galaxy S7 for about 2 weeks and I love it The processor is great and my pixel quality is amazing I also love the waterproof ability that comes with phone The speakers have improved since the S6 Overall it is a great product to own Sleek designGood featuresUser friendly sofwareSound quality is good Beautiful screen very responsive to touch all in I love this phone as I get to learn more about it with usage I will update this review  hello folks I got my Samsung s 7 a couple weeks ago and for some reason my off button and my volume lower button stopped working so I went to the great tech team called the Samsung pro team who is always at best buys nearest you and within minutes  it was fixed it turns out it was an app problem and just knowing that Samsung cares enough about their costumers to do such a thing comforts me my Samsung products are all I buy for I have a 65 inch smart TV galaxy s 6s 2 of the s7s and a gear s2 watch and have 2 of the vrs on the way I cant wait and have no problems with none of them love the technology provided by Samsung have a great day folks I was Expecting more Too slow and over heating change one cell phone in less than a week and the 2nd one it freeze it to muchspecially on videos not happy at all I have only had this phone for two weeks now and I couldnt be any more pleased The speed of the internet and apps are better than any phone i have ever had The size is great because i have always been looking for a bigger phone that is not overwhelming I had purchased a glass screen protector and even with that on the graphics and clarity are still amazing This is the first time I had purchased a Galaxy phone and I am definitely letting people know about how great it is Great product and very satisfied with Samsung I previously had a Galaxy 5 and couldnt wait for the 7 to come out Love everything the phone has to offer It lives up to all the hype and excitement that was advertised and talked about The S7 Edge is one of the most powerful product that I ever owned The processor is very responsive and lightning fast with no lag what so ever One of the best feature I really like about this phone is its ip68 rating and the camera on low light I have been using this ever since I got it on trips food adventure at work at school basically the phone goes where I go THE design is flawless but there is one flaw that got me a little disappointed which is the ir blaster Im always glued to my TV and without the ir blaster I cant use it as a remote on everything But overall I would still use this regardless of the ir blaster the phone is just on point I even recommended it to friends and now they all have one hahaha Had a Note 4 before buying this S7 Edge This has a great display and is easier to hold Fast response times and has additional features Takes great pictures Great battery life and faster I like that the phone is water proof I upgraded my Galaxy S3 to the S7 I had heard terrible reviews of the S6 so I had decided to hold off on upgrading until the S7 was released I am so glad I did I love the phone Have had no problems with the S7 My data easily transferred from one to the other  Such a great phone does everything you want and more I have bought the new Galaxy S7 because I wanted to upgrade from my old Galaxy S5 The price was ok the feature set was very good In S5 the fingerprint reader wasnt great but S7 has very responsive fingerprint reader I like the fact that it has 32GB because 16GB was too little for S5 My only con for the phone is that it does not allow to merge both SD Card and Storage together I was very disappointed about that once I found out Otherwise the phone itself is very stylish I like the edges and the size It fits in my hand perfectly Battery life so far is pretty good The fast charging power adapter is definitely helping in getting that quick juice when you need it fast This is the best cell phone I found the camera is great a fast processor I love the edge design and they say its waterproof so thats an added feature Loaded with features great camera easy to use
the apps that are preloaded are useful fun gamesgames run well on this phone I love this phone Smooth OS Expandable memory Fast and great camera Love Samsung I love my new phone All my apps music pics and contacts switched over automatically A few different changes but as soon as I hot use to it I love this phone phone works for everything i need plenty of power for games takes amazing pictures and videos Phone is just as advertised Very fast apps good call quality The best on the marketSamsung has set the bar high I really love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 I will definitely be recommending this phone and watch to ALL my friends and family Im a Galaxy phone fanatic This is my 5th one I was going to get the S6 Edge but was waiting for a great buy on other sites As time went by I started to read about a possible new Galaxy phone Rumors abounded I read something about it might be holographic Samsung had or was getting certain patents My mind went wild A new phone in the making Im one of those people who loves the latest devices So as more info became available all thoughts of getting the S6 Edge disappeared I was going to wait until the S7 Edge went on sale Then the announcement came from Barcelona that we could preorder phones on Feb 23rd And I did So 
I love this phone Its absolutely gorgeous Its now my favorite Galaxy After signing into my Google account I was in awe of how much I could do with it So after the usual setups wifi adding my apps changing the keyboard I got into 
Fingerprints  you can have up to 4 Its very easy to do and use unlike the S5 which has a depressed home button making it difficult to use since I have long nails The S7 Edges home button is flatter much easier for me to press And its a soft press 
Samsung Pay  another great option Easy setup The only problem with certain credit cards is their banks dont allow you to add to Samsung Pay Youll know this when you try to add a particular card 
Battery  phone does last a good days usage Much better than the S5 
Camera  takes stunning and very detailed pictures Options galore plus you can download more when youre in the Mode section Ive included a photo of a tortoise so you can see the intricate details of her shell 
Internet  extremely responsive Pages change in a flash Of course this also depends on what modem andor router youre using If theyre older models youll need to update 
Phone  log only shows phone calls Text messages are no longer included in the log
Text Messages  has a nice feature that allows you to put your favorite people in a row just above all text messages 
Sim  Memory Cards  these are kept in a little drawer thats in the top of the phone A device comes with the phone to let you access this Gently push pointed end of device into the extremely tiny hole until drawer pops open Make sure cards are sitting flush before reinserting drawer back into phone Otherwise you might damage a card 
I have only one big issue With a phone like this why only one speaker There should be two stereo speakers And the placement should be on the front not at the bottom where your hand might cover it 
Note Some of these features might be available in the S6 Edge Never having one theyre new to me coming from the S5 So I apologize if these features arent new 
Well theres so much more that I could post My advice is to go through all the Settings Most of them have an explanation of its purpose so you can decide if you want to use it or not This is one of the best features of the phone  giving you the information you need to best use your new Galaxy S7 Edge 
So if you want to go to a Galaxy far far away get the S7 Edge to take with you May the Force be with you This phone does everything And works great with the S2 I had the Galaxy S4 before upgrading to the S7 Edge I am very happy with the size of the screen and the clarity Thats the first thing anyone comments on when they see me using my phone I LOVE how quickly text messages are deleted now as well when deleting in bulk I have no real complaints about anything and it was a seamless switch from one phone to the other Ive had too upgrade from a iphone because it was really old but wow was i missing out These phones are great i can customize anything it really is amazing The Galaxy S7 efhr is the Samsung phone I have been waiting for I really enjoyed my Galaxy S4 but was looking for the next step up that would last me for a while I would highly recommend the Samsung GALAXY S7 to a friend Having the s6 I was on the edge of not buying the s7 I decided that it was time to update my mums phone so decided to give her the s6 and the free item with preorder was nice too I was nicely shocked with the notice of quickness The battery life is the best new feature followed closely by the expandable memory Hurray  I had the s6 but decided to try the edge version of the s7 I absolutely love it The screen is seamless It really just flows when you look at it I am so happy they got rid of the glass back added the expandable memory and the water resistance Some of the things I missed about my s5 So far the battery life is great I love the always on display since Im constantly have to check the time So far this is samsungs best phone yet Good quality build all around quick phone nice feel in the hands with the curved edges on the back This phone in particular edge is really annoying you turn pages accidentally hit something and when I try to type with Swipe 50 of the time its the right word Dont get me wrong I love Samsung but even if I had the original s7 I would still run into the swipe problems and when I try to gain access to the Internet sometimes I cant use my advanced calling or texting over wifi without restarting my phone This phone has great features but for me I wish the advanced calling and texting over wifi would work same with the swipe input The camera is amazing and the speed that I can download or watch movies is great And I wish that it came with the music app already installed But with saying all that maybe I just need to get used to the phone and its features easy to use nice camera and lots of cool features I have been a Samsung owner for years and will continue to be for years to come Love this phone Finally upgraded from my S4 performance is like night and day This thing is fast and very smooth Love all the new camera features especially love Samsung pay I upgraded from my GS5 to the GS7 and absolutely love it I was extremely pleased with my GS5 so switching was a no brainer Im loving the Samsung Pay and how quickly the camera focuses There are so many features that Im still learning aboutmostly the android operating system versus the actual phone 
The display is absolutely amazing compared to my old phone and other phones Ive seen out on the market 
Ive heard stories though of how easily the back glass gets broken or cracked Hopefully my cases will keep it safe The phone is a good size and allows items to be accessed quickly and conveniently The Galaxy S7 Edge is amazing I totally exceeds all my expectations Samsung S7Edge is a very reliable phone and is user friendly The Samsung Galaxy s 7 edge is everything I had expected it to be The phones I have used in the past are the note 3 s2 skyrocket s3 s5 s5 active and my final is the s7 edge which will be my final phone for a long while since I dont plan on parting with this one for a good while My 1 and only concern for this phone is that I dont want to drop it and risk the screen being Cracked so I consider ordering the tempered glass for it and a durable case I couldnt be more satisfied with my Galaxy 7 Edge The performance is spectacular the screen is dynamic the camera is amazing the waterproof feature has been helpful the battery is long lasting and the design is beautiful Again very pleased I love my new phone and all its added features I love to take pictures and this camera is unbelievable And now I never have to worry about an error message that tells me its not enough storage for me to take a picture because you can input a memory card The only reason I did not pick this over a nexus 6p is all of the features including samsung pay the edge menu a front finger print scanner a better camera game launcher and many more This is not the same TouchWiz that people have come to hate over the years I had galaxy 6 and didnt really need to switch but liked this product so well I did and am glad I did It works very well and Im very pleased with it My husband has the s7 edge and it is a little bigger but I like this size for handiness Great phone i love it design is awsome i have been recommending it to all my friend now they all want one Great features very reliable nice screen display I love the sleek look It has great features It was so easy to transfer all my information on my own I ordered the device online and had no issues Love the speed of the phone Camera is awesome too So far this has been one of the best phones i have owned I like curved edges makes the screen seem bigger The phone is very fast and responsive nice screen and app features Hands down the best phone Ive owned From the camera to the payment system This is by far the best Galaxy yet It should be called the Goldilocks This phone is perfect in size wheight and functions Expandable SD card slot 32 Gig bulit in So far this phone works like breeze Great phone designbatteryand camera The total package To start Ive been a long time samsung galaxy fan The S7 edge is amazing The curved design feela great and the slimness of the phone is amazing My biggest gripe about this phone is the lack of internal storage Here in the USA on ATT I can only get the 32gb version The operating system itself takes up 8gb so that leaves you with about 24gb Now I know they added expandable storage back but not all apps can he moved Out of the current 12gb of apps and data on my phone only 1gb was able to be moved to the SD card making it almosy useless I would have much rather had the option of a 64gb version like that available in the international version Aside from that I cant find anything I dislike about the phone Water resistant Which will help since I am at the Oregon dunes a lot and sometimes it rain and Im always around some type of water all the time fast and loving the SD card slot Tissue is by far the best Samsung that has been produced The camera features are amazingly easy to use and produce the best pictures yet I love the themes and the theme store I have owned nearly all of the galaxy series and each one has been better than the last 

Samsung has always had the most brilliant screens of all the smart phones 
on the market With vibrant colors and crystal clear pictures and adding the VR headset is a combination that cant be beat Being able to watch movies and play games in an environment that is bigger than life

Security features have improved year over year making it one of the most secure phones to keep your private information on Making Samsung pay one of the easiest and most popular ways for me to make purchases 

I love how Samsung has combined the water resistant protection from their s5 and and included the ability to add a 200 gb memory card to expand the phones memory to an astonishing 200 go card with an on board memory of 32 gb

There is so much more to explore on this galaxy I would definitely recommend this phone to any looking for the best on the market beating out the iPhone in price and value Fast phone great features I enjoy all the options the phone has Like having two screens up at the same time The sound options you have for your ear buds or Bluetooth are very nice Cant wait to see what comes next I made the switch from a Note 3 to the S7 and I am absolutely loving it The phone runs extremely smooth Love the alwaysondisplay I love all the features that the Samsung Galaxy s6 has Easy to use and to understand I love that it is slim and fits easy in my hand Just the right fit I have recommended this phone to all of my friends This phone had no flaws in my opinion The screen the camera battery life its every thing I could of wished for Great phone and battery life is greatly improved Its android so overall user experience is what you might expect But very fast and no problems at all my first few weeks 
Only thing is its a little slippery with the new metallic back Feels great in the hand though so trade off I guess My s7 edge is by far better than any other product that I have owned in the past I had preordered the edge 7 and I am very happy I did I had the Samsung galaxy S5 and was looking to upgrade but waited until the release of the 7 The features are incredible the style is quite elegant and beautiful I love the screen vibrant colors and smudge free screen Maneuvering through apps and features is very easy I also love the processing speed and functionality of the S7 edge It does not seem to lag at all and the connection to apps Internet and cell calls supersedes my Galaxy 5 hope so since its an upgrade Overall Im very happy and ecstatic with its functionality and reliability Ohh I almost forgot to mention I love the battery life I charge it the night before unplug it so its on my night stand and last me well into the next day I use it quite frequently and find myself not worring about battery life as I was in the previous model I cannot wait to try it with the VR and the 360 degree camera thats coming out Extremely happy with my purchase it is kind of phone that you can use it in every single minute of your day and yes dont worry about the charge it will stay for ever Camera works great even in low light Great speed Vivid screen I really like how the Edge fits my hand Battery life and wireless charging are awesome I can use my phone all day long It only takes an hour to charge with the fast charge Love everything about this phone Perfect feel and great performance I absolutely love this phone The camera is amazing And the phone itself is fast I also like that you can pick different themes for the phone The design and features of this phone are state of the art best phone Ive ever had i cant imagine there ever being a better one made i love it Great camera phone is very fast long lasting battery durable fast charging This version has surpassed my expectations The display is bright and clean the audio is vastly approved Only thing I would thing is it could be bigger and better able to remove the battery The only problem is locked bootloader Other that that the phone is fast Love the phone Previously had the S4 The S7 Edge is a combination of all the best features from S4 S5 and S6 Waterproof expandable memory large battery AMOLED display beautiful edge design wireless charging finger print security along with convenient Samsung PaySamsung got it right Bought the VR and greatly anticipating the arrival of my free Gear S2 Im a fan I have always been a Samsung fan and have owned several galaxy products but the S7 has the best screen lighting and quality picture The changes in the side button locations shows they are listening to consumer input I like being able to charge without flipping open a port cover and yet still is waterproof The feel of the phone in the hand is perfect I am an avid Google advocate and I love all the apps preloaded Easy to use and durable I was worried about the design being easy to break but after 2 weeks Im no longer concerned It holds its charge after all day usage The camera is a great improvement over earlier versions I have been a iPhone user for many many years I needed a change I felt iPhone technology had stahled Also anyone talking through an iphone they are very hard to understand and sound as if they talk through a can Not with this phone Clear as can be to the receiver of my calls Also this is my husbands 1st real cell phone He was able to figure it all out on the first day Its a great phone thus far The S7 has a sleek design that fits perfectly in your hand The functionality of this model compares to no other previous with lightening speed I would highly recommend this phone to all the individuals looking good to upgrade you will not be sorry Definitely Samsung I love the battery capacity and the AMOLED display I love this phonebest phone I have ever usedThank you for bring back SD card Its quick lasts along time and is hot looking

Apple Who

Thank you Samsung Perfect single hand size amazing screen improved battery life improved antenna coverage Highly recommend I first started using the Samsung Galaxy phones with the original Galaxy S It was okay did what I needed but certainly wasnt the best phone I ever had I went to an S3 from there and it was much better I then went to an S5 and it was the best phone Ive ever had When the S7 was released I was a little hesitant about going to the new version when my S5 battery life was still decent and the phone did everything I needed I couldnt be more happy with my decision

The S7 is a sleeker faster phone with a much more vivid screen display and noticeable performance improvements over the S5 I used to have The improved storage space 32GB vs 16GB still isnt as large as Id like but having the ability to expand it a feature the S6 lacked which immediately removed it from consideration in my opinion makes the phone comparable with the other phones on the market

My only real knock on the phone is that the back cover while stylish and beautiful is glass covered Ive seen many videos of people cracking theirs  which made me incredibly paranoid until I bought and installed a protective case So while its gorgeous I wont be seeing it since I had to get a case to protect it

I love the new speaker placement on the bottom I just wish the headphone jack was still located on the top This is this best phone Samsung has put out yet Ive owned the S3 S4 and S5 Ive always been pleased with each I was happy with the 5 and didnt really see a reason to switch to the 6 but the improvements and styling on the 7 sold me This phone is beautiful and so fast Im still learning all it can do The galaxy s7 is one of the best phones I have had yet Its simple interface and fast processor makes it the best android phone out there I love this phone its very fast  takes great pics Consumer Reports gave it a 1 ranking and so do I Love the battery life camera expandable memory waterproof everything It even is a phone The battery life is lasting longer than any phone Ive had and the camera is the best camera Ive ever used The phones design is great and love the expandable memory Best buy I made this year I was coming from a s5 to the s7 Had been wanting to get the six and put it off and then there was the 7 Preordered and was happy when it got here Then as I stared to download contact music and other things  I realized how much things had change on the phone I couldnt find some of the apps I was use to Now I know where these things are and the edge makes it easy I really like my phone The s7 is great Switching from the s6 edge the first thing I noticed was the improved battery life The phone doesnt get near as hot The now OS seems to be doing the job I got rid of the edge because I just never used the features This phones suits me much better I had the S5 and didnt upgrade to the S6 because of all of the changes I feel like Samsung did it right this time I love the phone love the battery life screen everything about it Not having a removable battery was not my favorite but after utilizing the fast charge I feel great

I would recommend this phone to any and everyone Very fast processing of apps The only thing Id have to say I dont like is that it doesnt have the IR for controlling audiovideo devices I used the heck out of the S5 and S6 IR Wish the S had it But still a truly awesome phone Just love my new s7 outstanding quality looks great great pictures love the edge feature I got this a week ago and have been in love with it ever since I took it out of the box It is everything that my Note 4 is not Battery life is extended greatly over that of the Note I am very happy with the much better life The case is sleek but not slick as to be hard to hold on to Its easily handled with one hand fits the pockets much better and the screen is vibrant and lifelike Processor speed is in a word blazing The apps and Email program scream along much faster than ever before Ease of set up and use is as fast if not faster than ever before Data transfer via cable from device to device supplied with the phone is another great innovation and is of much help 

All in all the experience is all together an upgrade This phone is amazing its the best smartphone Ive owned The camera is fast and is the most consistent Ive ever had on a phone Its hard to find much fault in this phone but there are 4 areas that I think could be improvedchanged 1 Remove S Voice and just use Googles voice search or provide the option to choose between the two allow it to be used when the screen is off and unlock the phone using trusted voice 2 Always on screen needs to display notifications from all apps not just built in apps allow settings to blacklist apps 3 IR Blaster please bring it back I know its old technology but its still very prevalent and useful I would use it daily if included 4 Speaker quality and location It would be great to have front facing stereo speakers to compliment the best in class amoled display and create the best media consumption experience on any phone Overall though its a fast and amazing device Wireless charging is a must for me so Im happy that Samsung is sticking with it and improving upon it with faster speeds Great phone Only issue is cases that cover the screen with a belt clip NOBODY MAKES ONE FOR THE EDGE Why I work in the construction industry  very dirty and need my phone on my hip Had I known about this issue I would have purchased a different phone Im used to an otterbox with a holster They dont make one SAD Have had this for about 2 weeks and so far it is preforming better than the Galaxy S5 by a long shot This s7 is everything that I had read about it and more I thought when the we got dual core 1ghz phones that it was nice and responsive The s3 and s5 were good phones This phone is amazing I do IT for a living and to be able to open any app and leave it running and still not notice a slow down AMAZING I have never been so happy with the response time of a phone in my life The camera is beautiful So sharp and crisp Any lag or issues I had with apps previously is just gone The greatest feature of this phone to me is the new camera It is incredibly fast and the colors are amazing The other feature though not new is the return of the expandable memory Thank god they brought that back or I would have never upgraded I love this phone but am terrified of breaking it Doesnt seem to be any protection like the defender series from otterbox Battery is great and the phone is really fast I use my galaxy for personal use and an iPhone for work Much prefer the s7 over all iPhone hands down Ive been a long time iPhone user and decided to make the switch and purchase a Galaxy S7 Edge Im so glad I did This phone is slick The phone looks great and it feels great in the hand and seems smaller than it actually is I love being able to charge this phone with wireless charging The screen is awesome and Ive already made a few people jealous when they see how great it takes pics in dark rooms Samgsung Pay has already come in handy a few times for me when I left my cards at home You will be very happy if you get this phone Never before has the human race had the ability to access infinite knowledge and entertainment and complete countless tasks in such a streamlined and efficient manner The phone is beautiful sleek sexy and allows me to access the ends of the earth The gods hold galaxies Im their hands and I hold a Galaxy in mine My Galaxy S7 has made me one of the gods I upgraded from a Note 4 to the S7 Edge I have always been a Samsung fan But this phone has taken things to a whole new level I love the functions it has and the camera is insanely good I got one of the first batches So I had a few bugs My carrier take care of me and now everything is running perfect I love my new upgrade and my new Samsung It is easy to use The pictures are sharp and clear I really like all the upgrades I have several products they last forever I never worry if a product is going to work It just does I always pass my old Samsung products down to my kids or family when I upgrade Wow Ever since the first iPhone came out Ive kind of lazed my way from one phone to the next through minor updates and new uninteresting features that Ive rarely used This is the first phone in a long time that I have been excited about and I couldnt be happier

It has everything I want in a form and a function that I dont think anyone has come close to in a long time If you told me today that this was the last phone I would ever be allowed to own I wouldnt even be mad I think the cellular phone has reached its final form

5 stars all around Id give it more if I could I have always owned a samsung with that being said i let my better half talk me into switching to an iphone Needless to say that it was the longest year of my life I was not a fan of iphone I couldnt be happier with my S7 edge Love it  nevergoing back The new Samsung galaxy s7 edge is amazing It has so many cool features like the edge panels and the always on display I enjoy having Samsung phones because you can customize in any way such as having widgets themes and changing the screen grid to how you want it I also was very impressed by the battery life because it is 100 times better than any of my past phones This new phone is amazing and I highly recommend it everyone I love the look and feel of the new S7 It has far exceeded my expectations I am coming from an S5 never upgraded to the S6 because of the lack of IP67 waterproof features 

The handset is sleek and modern looking The only downside to this is it is very slippery And the edges of the screen are SLIGHTLY curved so there are currently no aftermarket tempered glass screen protectors that reach the full edge of the screen All of these points are moot if you use a case of some sort and a film screen protector

The speed of the phone is blazing fast Apps run near instantaneously It would be nice to DEFAULT the apps to be installed to the external storage device

Speaking of external storage thank you for bringing it back I have installed the max 200 GB and have had no issues Cant wait to fill it with beautiful pictures from the new camera

Also thank you for moving the side button layout to not be exact opposite of each other From the moment this phone enters your hand you just feel like you finally got a real phone in your hands The product feels great in the hand and it operates even better The S7 is fast  smooth and runs everything with no issue The battery is great hard to believe they are able to do this with a 3000mah battery I easily get a full day13hours out of it and had the screen on for a good 34 hours while still keeping all the features on and still had 30 at the end of the day I cant help but talk up this phone when people ask if I like it Had the phone almost a month and still finding great features  Samsung has a real winner here Oh one more HUGE thing these color options are amazing I got the black and this shimmer it does in the light is so cool tremendous upgrade from the S5 my previous phone especially in terms of build quality and battery life Samsung continues to struggle with ram management however as even the 4 gigs of memory get consumed fairly quickly aside from that there isnt much to complain about I love this phone It has the greatest features and so user friendly
I love the accessibility and functionality

 Beautiful design
 Waterresistant
 Incredible ergonomics
 Fast

Cons
 Battery life is subpar
 Screen brightness is disappointing under direct sunlight
 Samsung should have a stripped down true Android OS
 Include useful notifications on Always On display
 Speaker is quiet and awkwardly placed as a finger usually covers it accidentally include stereo speakers I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and have not had any problems I specifically like how fast and smooth it is when opening apps or Web pages Went to this after using the S6 Edge and have no regrets This fits in my hand perfectly and the power  performance is exactly what is expected of a topnotch phone Love this phone I came from a S6 Edge and wanted something a little bigger and faster The only issue I have wit hthe phone is the removal of the IR sensor  Otherwise its a perfect phone Love this phone better than all the galaxies out there 100 satisfied with phone Solid phone that is loaded with features I was pleasantly surprised with how solid the phone feels The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the most streamline device on the market to date It has marked improvement in RAM management as well as an increase in battery size I love the fact they made it water resistant  Over all a very solid device  Love this phone Not a big iPhone fan Better than an iPhone Enjoying the bright display Screen size is large  easy to use Virtually no complaints This phone is amazing Build quality and design are unparalleled For the size of the battery I feel like the phone could last longer on one charge but I dont have a problem getting the phone to last the entire day This phone is amazing I had nothing but Samsung Galaxy phone since they first came out and to see how far they come and the amazing design this phone is the best I seen and used so far its amazing this phone is where its at The layout is amazing the smoothness of the phone the performance that it has Best yet the battery life it has its by far the best I play games do it all and this phone last for a day easily with out worrying of bringing or taking a charger with you for a day Thanks Samsung Ive been so happy with my Galaxy S5 that I have been resistant to upgrading had over 2 years But lets be honest Ive been living in the past by not upgrading and missing out on so many new features Well the time came that I decided to say yes to an upgrade and Im glad I waited The Galaxy S7 is everything and more I could ever want from Samsung The photos are lightning fast the screen is clear and crisp wireless charging is a breeze And the new processor and operating system are quick I Love this phone And would say to all those people unsure if the cost and time to upgrade is worth itYES IT IS I really enjoy the new features and form factor Great job Samsung has been the technology leader in my opinion for years now Very impressed with the s7 I love this phone I upgraded from the S4so man what a difference The sound quality is so much better Its not only louder but the quality of the phone call is so much more clearer The new features are great Im still learning things about this phone and have had it a little over 2 weeks now 

I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone

Love itand cant wait to continue to experience more new things on it This is my second Samsung phone and I am so happy I stuck with Samsung My previous phone was the S5 and this was a huge improvement The touchWiz has been softened up a bit and is now becoming an acceptable interface I still wish they would stop telling me how to disable a default app when I set an app as default Those nag screens still ruin the experience Fortunately those moments are not a daily occurrence 

The good 
 The screen is bright and crisp Its beautiful
 The always on display is a cool addition
 The fingerprint reader works great now it was horrible on the S5
 The edge allows me to stack my common apps there leaving my home screen clutter free
 I like having the wallpaper motion effect built in now too
 Wireless charging is now built in not requiring an additional casecover purchase
 Battery life gives me about 20 more juice by the time Im leaving work
 The UI is so much faster and smoother now
 Split screen is now a lot easier and supports more apps

The cons
 Not enough edge widgets I would really like to have a good music app that could be controlled on the edge from my own library not Milk
 The edge notification also needs more support again Id love to have it for music to change tracks without unlocking my screen
 I would have preferred Samsung had moved to USBC but its not a huge negative at least I didnt have to buy a bunch of new cables
 I wish the edge control was available on both sides instead of one side or the other
 Still has TouchWiz default app notifications as referenced above
 Needs more options for the always on display

I do feel like the price of the phone is a bit much but then again most people wont notice because its integrated into their phone plans I wouldnt pay this much for the phone if I was buying it unlocked I received my S7 edge on March 7 the first thing I love about this product is the fact you can input additional memory and in order to do so you must use a special key thats provided to you to open the slot I like the fact that the s7 is water resistant so that in case of any liquid accidents you know it wont be damaged The picture quality is wonderful and overall usage is simple I would definitely recommend this product This phone is soooo fast Youd be surprised how fast you can open an app Plus the water cooling keeps the phone cool in any situation This may be the best phone of the century This phone is powerhouse Excellent camera and overall speed make this device easy to use and appeals to every age group The only feature missing is the IR blaster Hopefully Samsung will bring back this useful feature on the s8 When my S3 started giving me issues around the time of the S7 release it seemed a no brainer to upgrade to the next big thingand indeed it was I am more than delighted with the S7 and especially with the Samsung Smart Switch app which transferred all my settings from the old to the new with great ease I didnt even need the new phone activated  just my wireless connection at home Done in less than 45 minutes One feature I do miss is the handsfree drive mode Since I drive a car lacking Bluetooth I used that feature of the S3 a lot Despite that I love love love the new GS 7 I just bought and it has been a week using the device I bought this device replacing my Note3 Got this device as samsung got the extended memory and waterproof features back
Great designLoving it The phone is fast  feel good in your hands Great pictures  battery life is very good can go all day on a single charge This phone is very fast compared to Galaxy S5 I have been impressed with the responsiveness to selections Just recently got the phone today loving eveything about it I am a big Samsung user so i kind know some things but the features on this device is unbelieve I upgraded from my Galaxy S4 mostly because I wasnt happy with the S56 models due to absent SD card Glad they brought it back its easy to put inremove although you need a little tool to open the water resistant slot The battery is true to the specs 25 hours although it comes with many built in battery saving tools that can extend it longer The camera is amazing and the low light functionality is finally up to par Love this phone
Ive always had good luck with Samsung products hopefully this will not disappoint me
Im still playing with all its features and Im very impressed so far Good pictures too
The prices of this phone is very high yet that didnt stop me from buying it from Best Buy but with the 12 month same as cash option
Not to happy about the nonremovable battery I dont like choices taken away from me
I did not buy the S6 because of that plus no expandable sd card
Luckily this S7 does have one Hopefully the non removable battery wont bite me later
Overall I would recommend this phone I have owned a variety of different kinds of phones and the S7 Edge is by far the most wellrounded and feature rich The phone is comfortable in the hand and doesnt feel like a large screen phone The camera is fast and takes clear detailed photos in a variety of different lighting situations The edge screen is useful and I use the night clock all the time There is nothing I dont like about this phone We just upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the new Galaxy S7 We love the new sleek design Were happy about not having a charger port cover Were happy that it has expandable storage We feel so comfortable with the durability that we let the kids go ahead and upgrade too Call it early this year because the s7 is the best smart phone of the year From the form fitting stylish design to the insanely high level of quality under the hood this phone has it all I just stepped up from an S4 and what a treat Fast bright display great appearance and flawless operation The only problem I have had is by somehow turning off mobile data I spent a few days unable to connect to Verizon 4g I was reduced to WiFi only and it took me a while to figure that out I also added a fast wireless charger and no longer have to look for cables and worry about how much battery I have left I love the fact that they brought back the memory card but wish they brought back the replaceable battery The water resistance is great lve already spilled a glass of water on it with no issues So far its been a great experience I have been a devout Samsung Galaxy user since the S3 While I was disappointed with the S6 Edge the S7 Edge has been a pleasure to user The readdition of the waterdust resistance the larger battery and the added Edge functionality have been amazing The AlwaysOn Display has made the phone much more convenient Overall a great phone and one I will be using for a long long time I received my Galaxy S7 Edge on 08MAR16 Ive used every feature except Samsung Pay because its incompatible with my accounts at Digital Credit Union The phone has fantastic performance except for when it overheats It feels nice in my hands but its easy to accidentally touch the edge screens  a big case is very helpful Every device has its flaws and despite this ones I think its still the best phone in its class on the market Plus GearVR is awesome My new Galaxy S7 Edge is the best smart phone I ever had The display screen is bright and readable even in the bright sun The battery life is great and goes through the whole day without a recharge The phone charges up fast when needed The phone was so easy to setup from old Galaxy S4 Navigations of the phone is really simple Its a great phone Reluctant to buy phone originally but after a lot of research and purchasing the phone very surprised and happy about camera and speed Just purchased and the camera is fantastic Also like the expandable memory 128Gb is great for a phone Average life of battery but the charge time is extremely fast 
The only downside is the preinstalled apps you can do without but there is an option on many to uninstall or disable
Overall exactly as expected has great camera which i was looking for in smart phone great display i am attaching moon shot with this review it came out great and water proof is great The phone is really nice and its fast and durable Great phone with fast speed and features and display is great Cant believe it A phone which tops the Iphone This is it Performance feel use is now the best The response of the phone is tops and the ease of use is very helpful when you are on the go I like the size and detail of the screen easy on the eyes Now use this over all my others Ive only had the phone for a few days but I like how its waterproof and shockproof Its quick and sleek The back is a bit slippery I would have liked it if the phone had leather backing like some of the other phones out there A case makes it too bulky though This is a great phone amazing display great battery life and many updated functions I had the Galaxy S5 before this and its a huge upgrade I love my new phone I absolutely love my S7 Edge battery is so much better screen is beautiful love the size of the screen Best Android phone on the market Pros
Great design
quick processing
solid display

Cons
Gets hot when using while on charger
Average battery life
Camera and apps that use the camera crash randomly
fragile dropped from bed to floor and screen cracked Battery will last all day  the phone is fast

SAMSUNG S7 EDGE IS A PHENOMENAL PHONE THAT DELIVERS ON ALL LEVELS  BEYOND 
Could not be happier with my new S7 Edge Cant wait to get the VR Gear for preordering the phone Looks AMAZING Stepping up from a Galaxy S4 to the S7 is so sweet Apps are so much faster so is moving through the internet The photo quality is fantastic particularly the rearfacing camera Those photos are as good as the front lens Love the always on lock screen Had the phone for a little over a week no complaints only praise This phone is awesome one of the best phones I have ever had Definitely love the waterproof feature My son accidently dropped my phone in a sink of water and its still working like new Great job with this feature Samsung  This is really the best smartphone on the market right now Great look and feel this phone is pretty swift I did however have a problem with my first s7 edge Turned out to be a hardware issue This is the best phone I have owned by far The screen size is great The quality of the videos and games is awesome The camera takes the best pictues I especially like that it takes night time pictures that make it seem like it is day light They ate perfectly clear and the color is spot on I have already told my friends that this is an awesome phone I would recommend this to everyone Keep up the good work Samsung You keep making my life easier I upgraded from the S5 finally because Samsung brought back water proofing and expandable memory The S7 is much quicker and the screen is still beautiful The camera on this thing is insanely quick to focus and take a picture and the quick access to the camera is an amazing function The phone is beautiful to look at feels comfortable in my hand and works flawlessly I have had it around 2 weeks now and am still happy with the upgrade 

Only bad thing is the battery is still lacking slightly It is still a significant upgrade from my previous phone but maybe I expect too much Very happy overall When I upgraded to the Samsung 7 from the 5 I was very excited I loved the 5 and knew the 7 would be even better I was absolutely right It was easy to TRANSFER all my information and if I had any questions the great people at VERIZON knew just how to help me Now Im enjoying the 7  Im taking beautiful PICTURES the CAR AUDIO connection on this phone is AMAZING
Thanks SAMSUNG for a great product I bought this phone to replace an older smart phone The screen size and clarity is great The Edge feature is very helpful I love this phone just the WiF and or 4gi not good Wish the keyboard was bigger Everything else is GREAT I was reluctant to switch over to the Galaxy S7 Edge because I was considering getting the next gen iPhone but after I saw this phone I fell in love The camera is hands down the best camera Ive had on my smartphone The auto focus is blazing fast and the pictures are crystal clear I love the fact that this phone is water resistant without having those irritating covers that break off And thank goodness someone listened when we wanted expandable memory brought back The battery life on this phone is amazing I can go two days before having to recharge I also love that Samsung finally moved the speaker to the bottom of the phone versus having it on the back panel Awesome phone The screen definition is a plus Camera who even needs a pro camera while on vacation Samsung everything in my house hold The phone is frickin amazing The only thing that i cant stand is the curved screen makes it so that you cant use tempered glass screen protectors Awesome phone Best camera Ive ever seen Very light weight and the battery doesnt heat up at all And the battery life is amazing itself Im on my phone frequently and Ive never had to worry about bringing my charger with me I like the ease of access with edge features and the custom tabs This phone sounds pretty good also gets loud to where I dont need a Bluetooth speaker Call quality is the best Ive ever had on any type of mobile device I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge because of its looks It has a sleek design with a bigger screen I love the fact that the battery usage does last a lot longer then the older Galaxys Another added bonus is the fast charging this phone provides I also love the fingerprint option given to unlock the phone and the Samsung pay I can use to pay for purchases vs taking my credit card out I love the new galaxy S7 its a very good phone better then all the others me and my husband are galaxy users and itd the best phone I love this phone I am very happy Samsung decided to bring back the SD slot I upgraded to this from and old S4 which dont get me wrong was a beast but and old beast at that This light beautiful phone packs amazing speed and a tremendous amount of RAM while being contained in a light weight package I like Samsung products When they came out with a water resistant phone I jumped at a chance to own one The S7 edge is a great phone It is light The speaker is located on the bottom of the phone instead of the back The edge makes it easier to have frequently used contacts to call or send messages right from the edge of the phone How cool is that I was looking into other phones until I found out they were bringing back water resistance and the micro SD slot in this generation of galaxy phones The camera is a major improvement as well it takes unbelievably good low light pictures for a phone Obviously the camera will not comparable to a DSLR camera but that should be expected

My only complaint is the lack of access to the battery The reason I say this is because my GS5 needed a new battery about 20 months after I purchased it I understand that batteries degrade eventually but that is why I want to have easy access to replace it when needed

Overall I am extremely happy with this phone so far I had a contract for two years with an IPhone and I could not stand it and waited tell I could get a new phone Samsung Galaxys are the superior smart phones and you can customize it to your liking I love my Galaxy Downloads are faster than any other phone Ive had The pictures and video way better than iphone I would recommend to my friends This is by far the best phone Ive ever had It takes beautiful videos and pictures It is very fast and it charges fast not to mention how wonderful it is to not have to constantly charge it This phone has so much great features Samsung never ceases to amaze Every time they upgrade size isnt the only new feature unlike other cell phones Best Samsung Ive owned to date Awesomeness wrapped up The phone is water resistant and expandable memory Great screenfastand Samsung pay has worked flawlessly I love just about everything with it but I dont care too much for how easy it can shatter
first thing is that when I got my phone and unboxed it there was already a tiny scratch 
on the screen right below the Samsung on the top and within the same day my phone
drop from a height of no more then 4 feet and the back of the phone not the screen 
thank goodness was already shatterd

The features are really awesome and bought me a nice case that covers up the 
back and makes it harder for me to see the scratch on the screen also if you have
the S7 and the screen locks up you cant just remove a battery like you use to Upon starting my very own plan at Verizon I purchased a Samsung Galaxy s3 then a few weeks later the s4 came out so I drooled over that for a year until the samsung galaxy s5 came out I snatched it up before it became backordered I loved that phone so much I passed in the s6 but then I decided I needed the Samsung note 5 It was great but something was missing I survived until the rumblings of the Samsung Galaxy s7 were heard round the world Yes it is water resistant yes you can plug a memory card into it yes the batter life is better Let the angels song reign down in me I purchased it and so far zero issues Very well made very durable like the waterproof feature Great phone but battery dont stay charged long enough I have to charge it copied and pasted from my elsewhere posted review
So hands on with the Samsung Galaxy S7 this thing is pretty cool I last used the S5 and liked it for its waterproof capabilities Not that i expect to ever submerge it but in the winter months I often will have my phone in an inner pocket of my jacket while out snow shoveling whathaveyou and i have steam fogged other phones with my own sweat before from having done this so waterproofness is key to me
Also the return of micro SD storage is very welcome 200GB card support the tap not swipe fingerprint reader is much better in operation than the swipe reader on the S5 was but admittedly this was partially due to the case i put on the S5 from day one If im going to drop this kind of money on a device and work in environments that are not friendly to delicate electronics im always gonna wrap it up
The bump up to 4GB of ram for the operating system is a big performance improver or the processor is the key either way working together the phone is ridiculously responsive The S5 was quick most of the time but once youve installed over 100 apps and a half a dozen widgets on your home screens it could get a little laggy Not so with the S7 It is pretty fast
And I love the fast wireless charging which thankfully works through the thick protective case I installed so there is no more fiddling with charge cables and port covers Actually there is no port cover on the S7 except in the case The phone itself does not have a charge port cover or headphone port cover but it is still waterproof to 1 meter for 30 minutes The IR blaster is gone but i very rarely ever used it so no real loss there 
The camera is pretty awesome it has less quoted pixels but a larger aperture for greater light sensitivity and better low light image quality The camera shooting modes are too cool too It shoots in 4K UHD which is awesome but it also does fun stuff like 240fps at 720p which plays back as slow motion I did notice a small stutter in the slow motion playback but not sure what the cause is or if it will be there in videos shot with more light Also available modes include time lapse and 360 degree object self explanatory shoot a full 360 view of an object as well as video clips attached to photo
The battery life is very good considering how hard i use it and the constanton display time and date only is a useful feature that will save a bit of time for me at least
Im running out of things to say about it but in a nutshell I like it
Major item i forgot to mention Marshmallow has a couple major features the most interesting of them being new permissions control You now have the power to turn off or on each permission requested by each app For instance my normal web browser uses several permissions by default but through the application manager in settings you can toggle on or off each individual permission For people who are privacy minded and like to have a high degree of control on their device and their information this is an absolute game changer
One week in Im very happy The Bluetooth audio has possibly somewhat decreased range while wireless charging but its still exceeds the 10 meter specification by a good bit It is somewhat expected that blasting magnetic resonance energy at the phone to charge it which is how wireless charging works might affect the quality and range of the bluetooth audio signal Device heating from charging is also noticeable but so far not an issue Battery life is solid neither much improved over nor worse than the S5 and seems better since the software update baseband update yesterday morning Most relevant to the average person the phone does not lag like ever I have a mess of apps and often switch tasks at a moments notice and I am impatient as heck if the phone glitched at all I would be on it like white on rice but it just doesnt do it web pages load quicker apps open quicker everything just works better than the S5 and the S5 was no slouch itself Ive had no issues with this phone The processor is very fast I am very impressed with the camera I love the features on the phone I got the new phone because it had good internal memory but you could only use the external memory and its up too 200gb so thats a plus for me The only thing I havent liked so far was made me do an update not long after I had the phone and now I think my touch placement is a little off I will touch in one place and it doesnt always work correctly This phone is by far the best phone i have ever owned Im big on technology and every year I have to get the newest latest and greatest Last year I went with note 4 instead of s6 only due to no expandable memory I love this phone This is the first edge phone Ive owned The edge takes some getting used to due to the way I hold it in my hand With a case it actually made a huge difference Samsung pay is amazing The integrated contact option to take a picture of a business card works really well and makes it really easy Everything about this phone is top of the line I gave it four stars just due to the edge being touchy I have already recommended this phone to everyone and will be buying my third for my brother My wife is not a big techy but she as well loves this phone Shes big on taking pictures off the kids and loves the better updated camera The biometric scanner is seamless On the note 4 it would take 4 tries to unlock themail phone The s7 first try to the point that I press the home button to check the time and it unlocks and opens the phone Its amazing

 Its expensive and I know this has nothing to do with Samsung but I hate installment plans The company I lease from makes it so installment plans are the only option They dont let you have certain options unless you switch I used to have unlimited data But they made it slow and wouldnt let me upgrade until my two year contract was up Again nothing to do with Samsung but it does affect the price only reason I brought it up Maybe Im easy to please or maybe this phone got it just right but Im in love with everything about it Whether its the water resistant feature the great edge features the amazing camera Samsung pay or all the sweet tiny changes to the interface from my last galaxy phone I cant get enough So many times a day I pick it up and love the feel of it in my hand and the way I move through texts or emails easily and I say to myself I love this phone The amount I talk it up to my family friends or a random person in line at a store who notices the phone or me paying with my it youd think I was getting paid to talk it up Im not I just enjoy it that much Thank you Samsung for giving me a truly great Android experience that reminds me why I stay with my Galaxys and stay with my Androids Such a fantastic phone Everything about this phone is amazing From the sleek and elegant look to the quick and smooth functionality Might be the best looking phonen of all time eclipsing the Razr flip phone from back in the day While amazing to look at the screen sensitivity is either all weird or its really easy to touch the edges of the screen on accident A case solves this and the fact its pretty slippery Even saying this its a great phone Speed design the themes store and I think the edge panels make this phone my favorite new phone of all time Just upgradedd from the galaxy s5 and love all the new features Camera picture quality is fantastic They brought back almost everything we loved Including a few things we didnt know we could live You really notice the little things and attention to detail with this phone I had the s6 edge and despite my best effort and excitement i hated it This phone is my love Still some minor bugs but that can be fixed with an update 8 core processor would have been nice and higher MP camera like before but thats just my pickyness Worthy to note I have spent over 3 years in sales and management of mobile devices and have used nearly every major smartphone usable on the GSM Network from 2012 to now The Galaxy S7 Edge is the epitome of a perfection for a smartphone Had the IR blaster not been removed I would have given it a prefect score This is a fantastic device on all levels My brother has had an iPhone every iteration since the original and he switched to the S7 Edge and has been thrilled with it as well It is perfectly designed extremely quick the Gear VR is surprisingly refined and a delight to use I cannot say enough good things about this phone This is the closest thing Ive ever seen to a perfect smartphone Im loving this phone Its really simple to operate Love the clear pictures it takes Over all its a great phone The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone its sleek it feels good in your hand the camera is amazing an its super fast As someone who has owned an iPhone Windows phone and a previous Android device This is by far the best phone i have ever had I needed a new phone that would survive an active kidfilled life I dont worry about being splashed at the beach or the pool and other than being a tad expensive and too susceptible to finger prints the S7 is perfect The camera is awesome its fast and its always reliably charged I really like this phone so far but to be fair I did just purchase it I have had 3 Samsung phones in the past and I have stuck with Samsung throughout the years because I think it is a nice product It has everything I want or need in a phone and then some This is why I continue to purchase Samsung phones However there are a few things Im somewhat concerned with for the S7 One is the fact that the battery cannot be removed Another concern is that the camera has less pixels than previous galaxy cameras Although I havent really had a chance to play around with the camera so perhaps it has better features Other than that I love the design I think it is slick and it works so I like that it hasnt changed much over the years Another feature I like is the larger memory 32 gig and the fact that I can increase that with a memory card Also the screen graphics seem smoother and more rich than they were on previous galaxy phones I know its still new to me but Im really excited to play around with it and learn what it can do Very beautiful phone sleek well built top notch hardware as always but the software is the best by a long way very smooth and stable Very very happy Upgraded from an galaxy s5 and very happy I did Phone is very well built but I feel like the battery could have a longer life I did not like how the screen is always faintly on but I have grown to like it as it makes checking for texts very convenient GREAT camera This phone is absolutely amazing Their is so much you can do on it Samsung you have really done it this time Its PERFECT I bought this phone on March 16th  trading up from my Samsung Galaxy S3 Loved the S3 and just had not gotten around to upgrading Finally went for the S7 and of course the graphics are better response time is faster and it has some cool features but About 3 days after purchase I started having problems with pages loading slowly or not at all while connected to WiFi Finally took it back to the Verizon store and they had the same problem and couldnt figure out why They replaced the phone and the same thing happened Everything was fine for about 34 days and tonight I started having the same problem Went online and found lots of answers on AndroidCentral Forum  evidently Im not the only one with this problem For some turning off Bluetooth while on WiFi seems to work Others its turning off location permission settings for certain apps and others even have success by deleting the Dunkin Donuts App or other such apps which utilize Bluetooth I have tried several fixes suggested by members of the AndroidCentral forum For me it does seem that removing the Dunkin Donuts app and turning off Bluetooth when using WiFi seems to help  for now Ill have to see what it does tomorrow I sincerely hope Samsung comes up with a fix for this soon yes it does seem to be a Samsung problem because S7 owners on providers OTHER than Verizon are having the same problem Ive been a loyal Android and Samsung user for many years but if this keeps up I may have to consider Apple I would have to say this is the best phone Ive ever owned This phone is loaded with features and packs the latest up to date technology I love the speed and graphics Ive had most of the galaxy phones The epic s2s3 note3 s5s6 and now s7 this is by far the smoothest one in both style and functionality I love it definitely recommend I have gone from an S4 to an S6 to an S7 Each version gets better and better I honestly wondered if it was possible to get a better phone than my S6 and the S7 answered with a resounding Yes The camera quality is higher taking photos that even make pic from my daughters iPhone 6 look like they were taken with a disposable from years ago I broke it in with a trip to NYC and it did not let me down even once

The S7 is fast the screen is crystal clear the pics are amazing and the battery life stands up to my long hard days with no need for recharges Oh  and when you add in the ability to add TONS of storage on an SD card you have a hands down winner At this point the whole water resistant thing is like icing on the icing Ive had my S7 for about a week now and have been very pleased so far

I was especially impressed by the ease of transitioning from my old S5 which was all but automatic  very impressive

I love many of the new features  such as the ability to have my phone unlocked based on a number of things such as location Bluetooth connection etc

Of course the microSD card slot and wireless charging are great The battery life seems to be better than with the S5 but it does not seem to be great still  my S7 made it to about 3 pm today For some reason reception does not seem to be as good in my home as my S5 and not all of my old micro USB cables seem to work with the new phone

Still this is a much improved phone over the S5 looks great and even feels better in my hand even though the design changes are minimal All I can say is this phone is awesome Samsung out did themselves on the display Love everything about it I will never use any other brand of phone Get yours today I use the new features all of the time My personal favorites are the edge panels the long lasting battery the always on display the edge lighting and all of the new camera features I love my phone to the max I have always have Samsung phone But this one here is amazing from the 4k screen all the way to the battery life I came from a Windows phone This has so many more features and I absolutely love the edge functionality From the great camera to the fast processor this device has everything I would not even think about anything other than a Galaxy from here on out Always been a galaxy owner Love the extra features on this one Only bad thing is the preloaded keyboard is not the Swype app and the Swype keyboard you buy is not as good as the formerly preloaded one 
Enjoy I love my new Samsung 7 phone It is more than I had hoped for it to be I am very happy about my decision to get it  After performing head to head against the best offerings from Apple LG and Motorola the Galaxy S7 stands the tallest I have had it for 2 weeks and it is the nicest phone Ive ever used and it should be Kudos to Samsung Way better than its predecessors Getting to know it still but love it so far I like the S7 a lot better than the S5 The features of changing the backgrounds 32 gigs the smaller charger Overall I am much happier with this phone Been an Android and more specifically a Galaxy fan since the S3 I switched from the other operating system whose name shall not be mentioned here and havent thought of turning back This phone is amazing and by far the best Ive ever owned The battery lasts me all day during moderate usage and even if I am playing on this phone for hours the fast charging has me up and going again in no time Samsung brought back expandable memory on the S7 so I have plenty of room for all of my media content The camera takes great photos and video as well I honestly cannot come up with one single reason not to buy the Galaxy S7 edge Have had the new Galaxy S7 for 2 weeks It is great Only thing I dont lIke so far is being unable to turn off the lights on the back and multi window buttons Other than that love all the emoticons for text messages The water proof cell phone s7 is extraordinary and awesome This is absolutely an untouchable product I truly love this phone Thank you samsung for bringing back the awesome SD storage space up to 200 unbelievable I had the Note 4 previously and though I love the idea of the phone it doesnt compare to the S7 The battery is amazing the speed of the phone is faster than Ive ever seen the camera is perfect There are so many neat little tools in the S7 like screen shot more than what your phone display by scrolling down This phone was definitely an upgrade from my Galaxy S5 I love it I liked how pretty the curve screen looks with the curved edge Once I adjusted the keyboard smaller everything got a little easier
Everything seems to process pretty fast Generally faster than my girlfriends iPhone 6

The slow motion feature on the video camera is awesome and very popular with my kids in sports 

The only negative features that I can think of When selecting the bottom left button shaped like a window pane running application selector and immediately tap the 1st window well sometimes it accidentally closes all windows very easily

Thats all I can think of Great product very happy The Galaxy S7 is an amazing device The speed utility and intelligence of it sets a new bar for smart phones
The only issue Ive noticed are rare glitches with the operating system that have required a restart to recover from Im optimistic though that future upgrades will completely eliminate them LOVE THE PHONE I PREORDERED IT AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS OUT OF IT GLAD THAT THE EXPANDABLE MEMORY WAS BROUGHT BACK  I HAD A NOTE 5 AND KEPT HAVING TO DELETE APPS AND PICS BC IT WAS ALWAYS FULL THE ONLY THING THAT THIS PHONE IS MISSING IN MY OPINION IS LIVE PICS OTHER THAN THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE WONDERFUL PHONE What is better then a new phone I had a 5 and loved itwaited till the 7 and I feel like a kid again Love that I can change my themes its fast and the camera is awsommmmeeee Among a lot of awesome features on this phone the camera has been my favorite Any lighting any speed your image comes out great Phone is high quality and does just about anything you can think of But it has it faults
Like
I dint know it was a time machine because dial up is back
My s5 let me talk and surf at same time but not the s7
I could change tv but now I had to buy a new remote
I love the vr
But the Internet is so much slower idk of its Verizon or the phone my s5 had 30 down 30 up but s7 has 10down 10 up
I do love the bigger memory and the SD slot 
I hope phone never freezes since I cant remove battery 

But over all a good phone just a little rough around the edges Phone works great Initially i had to run the battery all the way down and back to 100 twice now the battery lasts longer than my s6 Love the screen I love the new phone Not only is it fast but the bigger screen size is a plus for me I commute daily for work via train and i am now able to enjoy movies and tv shows on a bigger screen I also have better reception with this phone in certain areas vs my old phone I have used the new camera feature to make darker images brighter and it works amazingly well Samsung has def outdone themselves this time Bringing back the sd car slot was also a good idea on their part I love this phone its fast more features and the camera is amazing I went from the note 4 to this new s7 I have been very impressed with the performance and over all design of the phone The battery life is great and does much better than my note I really like the larger screen and a lot of the new things it can do The fingerprint button is a little touchy but its cool that you can get into apps with the touch of a finger Still getting to know it but so far I live it Water proof is awesome Performance is solid Battery is horrible I can barely make a full work day before it dies I purchased this phone for my daughter and received it on its release date A week later she dropped the phone from a height of no more than 15 inches and it landed on its back causing the whole glass screen to shatter I was under the impression that the glass was some kind of Gorilla glass but this doesnt seem to be the case Needless to say Ive already had to pay a deductible for the phone to be replaced I am really dissatisfied with the quality of this particular Samsung item nice speed and design i have no complaints on it The best thing since sliced bread Its not a phone its a galaxy Had the s5 and waited for the s7 and can say that the wait was well worth every second Phone has amazing features with an amazing battery life especially with its fast charge feature If you are looking for a sleeker and elegant looking device would recommend When I first got this phone I was a bit skeptical since I had just come from an s6 which for me didnt have a good battery in it This thing however cant be killed in an entire day Im super heavy on the usage Always maxing out on browsing Facebook and messenger Browsing forums on reddit And playing some neat little games I found on Google play Every day I average about 7 to 75 hours of Screen on Time and thats just the battery The rest of the phone is amazing as well The performance is spot on and the user experience is fluid and easy Not to mention how the phone physically looks and feels This thing is beautiful I have to put mine in a case cause Im clumsy but this phone is one I have a hard time putting a case on Its so pretty looking and the silver is just flashy I would totally give a solid 9 out of 10 for this Just because giving a straight 10 seems cheesy This is the first phone that my wife has actually looked forward to getting In the past she totally hated new phones but she totally loves our new Galaxy S7s We had S5s before but the new 7 just blows it away The camera is incredible Burst shots slow motion HD video panorama shots and a very fast shutter speed plus a lot more Its very Google oriented and has a lot of Google and Samsung Apps preloaded Very convenient and fast Wireless charging There is no owner access to the battery but depending on how much you use your phone through the day determines how much battery life you get but as I said the wireless charging is very fast about an hour for a full recharge and you can use the phone while charging You can up the memory from factory 32gb all the way to 200gb by adding a larger Micro SD card Waterproof to 5 feet for up to 30 minutes I love it I would recommend this phone to anyone I love the ease of access with the edge screen and I have been amazed by the quality I get from my pictures Everything Ive wanted in a phone so far Love my new galaxy s7 edge So glad I purchased it Im over joyed with the Galaxy S7 I recently upgraded from the 5S and while it was a solid smart phone it had some quirks and issues after using it for a couple years The speed quality of screen quality and ease of use of the provided apps is fantastic While I was initially hesitant to use Samsung pay its literally turned into one of the best features of this phone and wouldnt trade it for anything Its really a great phone It is the best Android phone on the market After preordering the S7 and having it show up the transfer of files from my S4 to the S7 went through without too many issues Some apps did not transfer and I am working with their support to see how to get it onto my new phone The screen resolution and speed accessing files is great
The biggest bonus is the return of the micro SD card I installed a 200GB card and have all the music pictures and videos I need Finding where settings are takes a bit to get used to but all in all I am more than pleased with the new phone I have had the htc one for four years and then I switched to this phone The awesome Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE No comparison of course its faster its new I use my phone for calls computer access texting spotlight when needed working with blueprints I could go on Whats amazing is how it keeps up The extra storage is also nice as I probably take a minimum of 30 pictures a day I have a beautiful wife and three daughters The focus of the camera and the zoom are a plus Especially when Im on a job site getting pictures of old greasy machinery in low light sometimes any light at all If Im working on our cars or looking up parts it all right in the palm of my hand And by the way I am a very impatient personwell done samsung well done I highly recommend the Galaxy 7 Edge Great phone I wanted to wait for the note 6 but I damaged my note 4 I bought this phone thinking I would sell it when the note 6 comes out I am beginning to rethink that this is an awesome phone I really like the edge functions Excellent phone with excellent features Speakers are little quiet compared to my old note 4 but thats to be expected This is by far the Best Device in the Samsung Family Best Phone Ive Ever owned and believe me when I tell you I owened ALOT of Phones and its a perfect pair to my Samsung galaxy gear S watch This phone is what Ive come to expect from the Galaxy S series Its fast and dependable I really like the expandable storage in addition to the generous 32 gb device storage It works great as a hotspot and connects easily to wifi and bluetooth Wow I cant believe it this is the best phone out there I am very satisfied with my Galaxy S7 Just wish my battery lasted longer and it didnt get hot so easily The S7 feels right It is fast in performance at all times This is the best phone in my opinion that Samsung has ever designed It is very light thin fast and clear I love this phone and the watch to match is an amazing pair The ability to add 200 gig of memory is such a great addition to the already 32 gb the phone comes with The phone has met and exceeded all my expectations I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great cell phone I really like this phone Im happy Samsung chose to go smaller instead of making a device that cant fit in your pocket The one drawback is the speakers do not seem as loud as my last phoneThe camera is absolutely wonderful The pictures are amazing quality Overall a great phone  I will always own a samsung The Samsung S7 is the best phone Ive ever owned The ease and speed of downloads is much better than its predecessors Granted I upgraded from an s3 to the s7 but its processing speed is incredibly fast The camera as described is amazing with so many special features to play with Im unlikely to use most of them Ive been able to go all day in the 1217 hour range before my battery needs recharging too I think new phones are too expensive but with all the added bonuses this time Im quite satisfied

Oh and I thought Id hate the gold only option available where I got mine but its a much nicer shade of gold than what I saw of the gold s5  Having been a Samsung Galaxy user for the past few years S3 S4 Note 3 Note 4 I must say the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is an innovative shift As a former Note user I must say I miss three items the SPen the IR Remote and the size of the phone in my hand The S7 Edge is often too small for comfortable one handed use in my opinion The readdition of the Micro SD card is a huge plus along with the now integrated wireless charging Also Ive paired it with the Samsung Gear S2 Classic and they work incredibly together The finger print reader is an awesomely integrated security feature The battery life is perfect for such a wonderful screen Overall the phone is amazing but I keep reading for my S Pen After using the note for the past two years I believe when the next Note arrives if available in Edge I will surrender this phone to my wife I dont need the features of the Edge but the design is flawless and beautiful and actually makes the phone more easily navigatable without the need for apps on multiple pages Oh did I forget to mention Samsung Pay This feature is the best digital pay feature available Back on the S4 we had the ability to pay using the ill names ISS app but this pay feature works everywhere I went to the dentist the doctor Walmart Trader Joes and a few more small stores and used the card without and issue and with my fingerprint Flawless I cannot do without this feature The Galaxy 7 has been fun to use It is very user friendly Highly recommend it I buy a new Galaxy phone every time they come out I found them for the last 8 years they are always the greatest phone on the market and always have the best features I can never see me changing I would have no reason to The phone has been amazing I switched from am IPhone and this phone gives me more freedom and is very snappy Lets me organize things the way I want and givesee me widgets S7 is hands down one of the best feeling phones when in hand Audio comes out clear and water proofing has already saved me twice I have owned a galaxy for the past four years this is the best version of a Galaxy I have ever experienced I am a professional so all my use is professional no games and I am a power user I run six email addresses and three Google accounts off of the S7 The phone is smooth and I have experienced no lag with all that data management I frequently used my device for presentations and again no lag The battery is great I take it off the charger at 6am and return it to the charger at 11pm the battery will be around 18 when I place it on the charger All day I am browsing the Internet checking and responding to email and while talking on the speaker phone most of the time It is a great device I highly recommend it I just upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy S7 I have had the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy S 4 also I have a Galaxy tablet Samsung Gear Circle Gear Fit and the Galaxy S2 on the way I love how all my Galaxy devices work together in a harmonious manner I am so happy that I upgraded from the S5 to the S7 The fingerprint scanner so great on the S5 but works even better on the S7 Instead of sliding your finger across the button all you have to do is gently leave it there and the F7 reads it perfectly Its such a great way for me to password protect my phone with ease The S7 has a longer battery life comma higher screen resolution and I cant even express how Magnificent the pictures are that Im taking The quality of the pictures is worth it alone I received my wireless charger in the mail yesterday My Galaxy S7 charged wirelessly all night and I loved it It was so easy just to set my device down and allow it to charge instead of having to fumble with cords in the dark I personally did not want the Galaxy S6 because I prefer to have expandable memory in my phone Im a person that uses a lot of memory I love that the internal memory of the Galaxy S7 is 32 gigabytes and I can still put up to 128 gigabyte SD card in it The gold is a very Sleek color and suits me well The back does not remove off of this phone which I find a bonus also It keeps it safe from water damage Its got this neat little tray on the top that you can slide your SD card and SIM card into The size of the phone is perfect About the same size as the Galaxy S5 I think the Galaxy Notes and such phones are a little too large because they wont fit in my pocket nicely but this phone is still large enough to view media search the web and whatever else I need to do with it I cant find a negative with this phone It was worth every penny and I say it again I will continue to stay loyal to Galaxy devices I have had a Samsung Galaxy for years now I appreciate everything they do and how easy it is to navigate it I love the camera It is so realistic and takes great pictures While I have owned many cell phones in my journey through this life this one is the best one yet From the look I have the gold one to the performance it tops them all I love this phone battery life is great
SD Card Option is great 
I love that it is waterproof Love this phone all of the issues that I had with my S5 are gone The only design change that I would have liked is a removable battery brought back Samsung battery life has not been their strong point over the years So we will see how this one holds up I love this phone though very responsive the screen is very clear and the picture quality is great Overall best phone Samsung has produced Love the fact that its waterproof again like the S5 was very upset when the S6 wasnt that way so im glad I held off until this one came out Love the fact that I can add a micro sd to this one again too so glad that feature is back Over all an awesome phone will recommend this to anyone that asks I love my new phone This phone is easy to use and has great features I would recommend this to anyone This phone is far superior to all previous Samsung Galaxy Phones I really think there is nothing missing from this phone With the expandable memory for all my pictures and videos who could ask for anything more It needed a case for fingerprint protection and accidental touches picked up the new see through case great looking and still feels as great at the phone itself As a mom of a child with 2 legs and dogs with 4 this camera is perfect for me I also love the fact that the sd space is back I know my mom is jealous she only has the 6 Listening to videos is also for the first time loud enough that i can watch the video with background noise and not have the phone up to my face to hear it Honestly this will be hard to top but i dont doubt that they can next year Ths was everything i expected and more This phone is very well designed I like the slim design and all the features My only complaint is that the wireless charging has to be almost exactly centered for it to work I am sorry but I have a iPhone 5 for my work phone and am an avid Galaxy fan I have owned everything from the S2 to the Note 5 This phone is amazing I love how you have redone the edge screen not like my Note Edge but it is better in every way it feels better in your hands ALOT faster and worth the investment I highly recommend this to anyone Yes it is better than an iPhone I HAVE HAD THE S7 FOR A SHORT TIME YET IT HAS BEEN THE BEST PHONE I HAVE OWNED I am a previous iPhone user I switched because of what I heard about the galaxy s5 from a friend This phone beside the no battery swapping is everything the s5 did but with added steroids lol awesome galaxy and beautiful clarity  This phone is easy to use and very customizable I used to be an only iPhone user but now love Androids especially this phone Currently Im experiencing an issue with sound quality during calls But overall its a great device to date The snapdragon variant has horrible audio If your ok with that then it is the best phone you can buy Btw an external dac is awesome with it Love this phone Went from a Note 4 to S7 Edge but did not lose much in screen size Thinner and lighter than the previous phone The phone is amazingly fast and easy to navigate I have had the phone only 2 weeks so I am still learning all its great features but so far I am really impressed by all the new technologies of this phone The processor is very fast and the curved back gives it a nice feel Had an HTC beforeWOW What a difference I have the s7edge love how I can get to everything fast awesome phone Ive had this phone for about 2 weeks now and Im still learning but I love love it I am so pleased with it as of now and have nothing bad about it Thank you The design and style changes is subtle but makes a big difference The feel the home button all feels and functions smoother New features the battery life and bringing back a few old features really makes this above the s6 The water and dust resistance is back and should have never left The only issues with the phone are removing some features like black and white mode Yes you can set ultra powersave by but to save battery Id keep my phone black and white mode while at work to ensure my phone was always ready no matter what I hope some updates come out to bring this back and to fix a few other features and apps that worked on s6 but not s7 I love the screen clarity The battery life is fantastic I love my new phone Its an awesome phone just needs removable battery and it would be perfect I got this phone because Samsung brought back water resistance and fast expandable storage and partially because its a Galaxy Its so capable of performing so many things that I cant possibly list them The gold is very shiny and well designed but is prone to smudges Everything is very fluid and easy to learn is youve had any experience with Android in the past and the phone is a good thickness Didnt upgrade to the s6 because of water resistance something that I need really like the always on display and the wireless charging is a great feature overall I think the s7 is a great phone The camera is great  love the split screen also when Im working on the phone and a call come in it doesnt interrupt me with call screen Love this phone Best camera features love they brought back expandable storage and water proofing I cant live without this phone from personal use to my business it meets all my needs and more I love all so far about the S7 from the design size weight and all the features Im sure the more I play with it the more Ill love it
Perfect all around Coming from a Galaxy S6 Edge here and I will say that it isnt just a small upgrade Snapdragon 820 Fast wireless charging heat pipe for cooling down components Vulkan API graphics TruSignal for improved calldata reception 1000mAh bigger battery f17 dual pixel camera f17 front camera half inch bigger display and is improved always on display 4GB RAM IP68 waterdust resistent microSD card purchased a 200gb intergrated with UFS20

It matters The battery issue has been fixed I can use my phone all day with out charging it Lasts for hours and hours of actual use I am also loving that the expandable memory is available It allows me to have as many apps as I want and all of my music The S7 has renewed my love for Samsung Exceptional battery life improvements in camera image quality and low light performance thanks to the new 12 megapixel image sensor and the ability to record 4K video with decent optical image stabilization Even though Samsung is now using liquid cooling technology in the Galaxy S7 Edge it still does heat up while installing apps or charging The speakers are at the bottom like the last phone and are loud enough to be heard while walking on the street with the phone in your pocket The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is definitely worth the wait I had the Galaxy s4 and s5 active models prior so you know when I say that this is the best one yet it definitely is Expandable memory waterproof and a camera just as similar to a DSLR as you can get are just some of the many extraordinary features of this smartphone A premium phone and the best Android device on the market today Water proof and in black It was an easy was switch from the S6 This version is slightly more narrow in comparison to the s6 edge so it fits a little better in my hand The low light picture function is amazing I have sugar gliders and being nocturnal they dont like bright lights and flash can hurt so being able to capture moments in these low light situations is great for my lifestyle The devices performance is fast and call quality is remarkable The battery even lasts a little longer in this new version I have one minor issue with application load time It seems that the apps were loading a little faster on my S6 Edge This is hands down the best device I have ever owned It completely stomps on the iPhones that I have had in the past and is a significant upgrade over the s5 that I previously owned Love it The Samsung S7 is the perfect size style and performance I need The picture quality is incredible and beats any other phone Ive owned 

The quick luanch camera feature I use everday and the color quality of the screen looks good in both the afternoon daylight and late evening

Elegant functional and simple to use is only the beginning of this great phone It is the only phone I have used in over 15 years that I can easily say I LOVE THIS PHONE This is the best Galaxy phone on the market The battery life on this is amazing Much better than the s6 The camera is great Ive taken so many good pictures with it This is just a great phone overall Ive had the phone for about 2 was and so far I love it I love how easy the phone is to use and love the edge features Ive had the s7 for almost 2 weeks and couldnt be happier New to Verizon  started with an iPhone 6 plus but so glad I switched to this Beautiful display great camera very easy to use Ive been streaming March Madness games regularly for hours and still have 30 battery at the end of the day Call quality has been very good I have poor cell reception inside my house no matter what carrier so WiFi calling is a must and has worked seamlessly This is by far the sweetest cell phone on the market Very lightweight easy to hold onto processes very fastfeatures are fantastic This product is great the only thing is I wish it had better TV remotes that could control everything on one app Xbox One your cable box and other accessories and you can use one remote for everything I preordered the galaxy s7 edge the first day it was available This is the first Samsung phone I have owned There is really not anything I could ask for in a phone that this one does not offer It is fast has a terrific screen and feels very premium in hand The only thing I have found to be a problem and it is probably just my big hands but I tend to have a few accidental touches on the sides of the phone but the latest software update helped some of that 

I am very pleased with this phone and am very happy that I decided to go with the Samsung I am not a tech expert I know what I like and the s7 is everything I expected I am very happy with it Fast great camera excellent apps Very easy for me to use I am not a young person I want ease of use on my phone The sound is exquisite for all my different musical forms I loved my s5 hated to give it up but the s7 made the decision easy I am still exploring all its features and I have not been disappointed The Samsung Galaxy S7 has a awesome design easy to handle and probably the best performance phone Ive ever had TouchWiz is so easy to use now expecially on top of marshmallow The only downside of this phone is that it has a locked bootloader which looks like all us variances do Love this phone but my next phone will have a unlocked bootloader Thanks for making the almost perfect phone This is only my second Samsung phone but it wont be the last Compared to my Galaxy s5 the s7 is much faster Images look gorgeous I love the new features and shortcuts on the S7 I dont want to spoil and say what they all are try one for yourself The camera takes amazing photos and videos Ive already spilled water on my phone and its fine Im so glad Samsung brought the water resisting back Im very excited that my phone is able to use the fast wireless charger My phone charges from 20 to 100 in a little over an hour awesome 

The battery life is so much better than my s5 From 530am to about 1045 my phone will still have about 45 battery life left With my s5 my phone would be dead by then I feel the phone is very durable with the metal backing The phone feels a bit heavy but worth it Samsung didnt built it cheap 

The only con that I have is that my temptered glass screen protector doesnt cover the whole screen and there is a halo effect where the edges are bubbled 

Overall to me it exceeded my expectations I tried not to read a whole lot about the phone before I tried it out I wanted to see the surprises for myself I recommend it I really do I will be staying with Samsung for a long time Thanks guys Its not often you can purchase something and be 100 happy with it This phone has exceeded my expectations In both function and features This phone is fast and takes all different types of photos I run my company with it and have no problem multi tasking between several different programs Its so nice having widgets where every screen can show me what I need to see Versus going in and out of apps If you are looking for a smart phone that

1 runs the current Android platform
2 is fast
3 looks fabulous
4 differentiates itself with the Edge screen features
5 has fabulous battery life  fast charging
6 has expandable storage
7 takes terrific photos
8 has incredible screen presentation
9 fits perfect in your hand

Its simple you should buy the Samsung S7 Edge Couldnt be happier with this phone there is nothing like it on the market not even close Prior to this I had a s5 active and I loved it and wasnt ready to let it go The s7 edge is way better on every level Smsung S7 Edge  beautiful design
Only 3 stars for Features because missing IR blaster
The Edge on the edges is too touchy and too sensitive when you hold I hope Samsung is listening and will fix this soon

Overall great phone and Im very happy with it The battery was not as good as I was expecting Definitely love the water resistant and the SD card Sleek stylish fast perfection Must have phone Cant live without Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is an awesome phone I love it I have had the S5 and S6 and this is the best of both Ive had several Samsung Galaxy phones  this is by far the best yet I love the way it feels looks  operates With MS Office and all the apps that are available I am very happy with the change

The ergonomics and the feel in my hand is good It only took me a few days to get comfortable with the phone

Really happy with the fingerprint reader the S7 is so far the best phone I have ever used I made the switch to Samsung after a long stint of iPhones I wanted something different and I wanted flexibility with my phone and storage This phone does that I can put in up to 200GB of memory the photos are amazing with the low light feature and the price is better than a new iPhone The phone is a little big for me and I have not purchased a case yet so I am very careful not to try to do too many things with one hand Other then that the phone is great Does everything I want performs great and has the SD slot I was excited to see brought back This is my third Galaxy S series phone and it is by far the best one yet I really love the always on display and that is holds a 200GB card This is one of the best phones I seen Samsung has def Out done themselves Awesome phone upgraded from an S3 Yes it was time Very nice feel in the hand I would consider the S7 Edge just because of the larger screen and larger battery Other than that the specs are the exact same I came from a Galaxy S5 and didnt think the S7 would be this much of an improvement The S7 just seems to do everything so much faster and better in every way The built in speaker is not only louder but has much better quality The fingerprint reader is so quick it makes lock screen widgets useless The note 5 was my favorite phone that Samsung has ever made until this one Great phone fast sleek design I can record videos in uhd samsung pay is another reason I got this phone works perfectly this phone does everything The new s7 is a great phone Love the water proof and new memory slot is back Takes amazing pictures even in low light I do wish battery was remove able Already i have Samsung S5 and i bought this due to edge Working great with fingerprints and samsung pay With the ability to expand my memory I am able to do all the apps I want at wonderful speeds This gold platinum color is so fresh looking especially when combined with the nice sleek case that theyre letting out with these Im not the type to want to test out water resistance but it surely does make me feel so much better with that I  68 rating that it has My fiance and I have these phones now we started with the S5 and its only gotten better High quality phone with all of the perks you could ask for water resistance durable glass expandable storage and an awesome camera Ive had this galaxy s7 for 2 weeks The battery life is amazing I love the clock on the screen even when its not on So far Ive only had one issue that I think is because of the screen protector Its similar to the s6 but the ability to add more storage means I dont have to be so careful with pictures and apps I cant say enough about the battery life It charges almost twice as fast as the s6 and when youre not using it the battery drain is minuscule Samsung did it again They have released another great phone Im so happy they brought back the memory card feature The camera is amazing and the overall quality is GREAT Everything about this phone is spot on I really cant think of any features they could add to make this phone better The design is gorgeous and has a beautiful screen The always on display is also really cool I love how the phone can conserve energy by shutting off pixels not in use Battery life is great and so is performance Samsung pay is amazing and I use it every day This is by far my favorite phone I have ever owned The new S7 is a spectacular phone I have never been a fan of the iPhones personally so this was a great option Just watched consumer reports last night on the S7 and they have it ranked above the iPhone 6 The expandable memory gave it the edge I believe is what the report said Super satisfied Great device and easy to navigate Love the Android newest software Nice features and very easy to uselove it By far the best smartphone on the market Samsung to me puts out the best phones on the market I love this product so much it has all the greatest features the design is incredible it feels good in the hands I wouldnt trade it in for nothing in the world and Im so glad because I hate iPhone Lol I love my Galaxy S7 Edge I mean what can I say lol The size is perfect I love how quickly the camera focuses With an average day of fair amount of internet browsing and video viewing along with light game playing I can end the day with approx 40 of battery remaining I also run bluetooth all day to connect with my Gear S2 Plus I can get a full charge within a 12 hour I have absolutely no complaints about this phone at all it is a must have This is the galaxy we all have been waiting for I have owned every incarnation of the galaxy phone and this thing nails it Upgraded the micro SD to 128 gb for extra everything The Camara is insane the screen resolution is nuts the battery life is way better than the last 2 models Quick charge Dont mind if I do Buy this phone My GearVR ships April 1 just another reason this phone hits every mark possible Trust me get it and forget it you wont regret it Overall the phone is awesome Discovering all the new features has been fun The camera is incredible Fast beautiful pictures that always get compliments This could single handedly be one of the best phones of 2016 It packs features like a 2K super amoled display waterproofing expand let storage and much more I still wish it had a removable battery and a IR blaster Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone because its a purchase you wont regret First of all Im very glad that Samsung put the SD card slot back on I jumped from S5 to S7 edge skipping the 6 because of SD slot I have to say it was worth the wait I got the platinum silver absolutely love it I have so many great things to say about this phone The touch wiz is super clean and easy to read Options on this phone are very well organized so its easier for elderly to use this phone now I love the icons and the screen resolution is stunning One of my favorite is the VR If you have not tried it I highly recommend it Its a whole new world in there iPhone is 5 years behind in technology If you want someone stylish slick and fast try out the S7 Edge Youll fall in love with it Im glad micro SD card came back It very good phone Pic just very good Plus good thing about the phone is it can take water if someone drop it Fast charging time that I like about Ive had Samsung phones ever since I got my first phone and this is by far the best one It takes beautiful pictures its really fast in loading everything there is no lag I have no complaints whatsoever I totally love my new Samsung S7 It is the best galaxy to date So happy that the expanded memory option is back and the new extra features are wonderful It is a great phone It has a lot more features than what I expected and it is super quick I switched from a iPhone 6 plus Nice slim design fast smooth functioning edge feature is great and the ability to have a split screen is great I really like this phone It is very well put together in my opinion it is the best galaxy phone yet the screen is very responsive the camera takes amazing pictures with amazing detail and the resolution of the screen is fabulous Came from the Galaxy S5 and couldnt be more happier with my purchase of this galaxy S7 Edge only complaint is The Edge can be a little sensitive to my big hands that hold the phone other than that I just have to learn how to hold it correctly so that I dont accidentally open up things that you normally wouldnt No other real complaints everything has been great love the new features would recommend it to everyone thinking about getting one over the standard S7 Everything about this phone is awesome So glad that features such as being waterproof and having a memory card slot were brought back to the Galaxy in the S7 I previously owned the S4 which was a great phone in itself but i am so excited for the newer features with this phone Marshmallow is a great OS everything is easy to find and the display is great The camera takes amazing quality photos I have only had this phone for 2 weeks now but I cant wait to really put the camera to the test The wireless charging is another cool feature that has been added to this phone since my S4 I preordered this phone and I am so glad that I did The only thing that I wish they kept in this phone was the RF blaster to use as a universal remote control It was so convenient to be able to turn onoff my tv with my phone But over all I would recommend this phone to everyone This is as of yet the best I have seen of the Samsung Galaxy phones Being waterproof capable of holding and supporting a memory up to 200GB and all of the many other features it has makes it something anyone could want The only downside for me as of yet which could easily be remedied with covers is it can scratch very easily This can be easily avoided however if you just purchase a scratch proof screen cover and a case but had they done more to resolve this then I believe this would have been the absolute best Samsung phone on the market I still prefer it overall By far the best Android phone I have owned Its great to have the SD card back The camera is incredible and focuses super fast The IPX68 rating is great to have although I have not tested it General performance is very fast and the larger battery is a big plus Couldnt be happier with my purchase two thumbs up I have been using Samsung Galaxy phones since they were introduced I usually get a new phone every other year Moving from the Galaxy 5 to the 7 Edge is unbelievable The phone is very easy to use and the features blow away anything that is on the market This is without a doubt the best phone I have used and will continue to use Samsung phones For a guy who is not so tech savvy the Samsung Galaxy S7 makes my job even easier I absolutely love the display the true to life colors are amazing The picture quality from either camera is outstanding Took some pictures last night of a full moon and a cloudy sky lets just say breath taking The Samsung Galaxy S7 is even better than advertised Oh wasnt going to mention this butdropped it in the wash basin completely submerged no problem here I love my Samsung Galaxy S7 Get yours today This is w wonderful device I am having battery issues and it could be Carrier related along with Samsung unnecessary apps that I dont use Also having Google apps I dont use and these apps cant be removed 
 Other than that Im loving the device Learning new stuff about it everyday really like how you can change the theme of the phone S7 has great features is quick and takes amazing photos and video I love the look and feel of this phone Its lightweight yet substantial So many great features speedy has a great camera great sound quality So much more I love this phone more than any other Ive owned Great for your everyday tech needs from texting to streaming this phone can do it all and its super fast clear calls fabulous pictures Couldnt expect less from a Galaxy The Galaxy S7 Edge is a very capable phone its a good iteration from the S6 and is a major step up from the S5 I usually purchase the odd number Samsung S series phones so I was coming from the S5 to the S7 With that said I do have experience using an S6 for a time to compare Coming from the S5 is almost an upgrade in all way except the change of a few features The removal of the IR Blaster is a shame It was handy universal remote that I found myself using a lot when traveling While not something I used frequently the removable battery was a quick way to reset the device The plastic housing of the S5 had a better grip in the hand The S7 is a bit slick and if you dont have positive grip on the phone it could slip from your grasp Now with that said the things I do find great The increased battery and better power management in Android 6 are a significant improvement over the previous generations The overall build quality is great On par with the S6 but much better than the s5 It feels solid in the hand The camera is just amazing Its quick to focus and so far Ive noticed great color reproduction and detail in the photos The pro mode is a nice touch with the ability to save Adobe DNG raw files Although these save to the on board memory so I could see that filling up if you dont copy the raw files off the phone

This is more of a first impression with the phone as Ive only used it for a few weeks since its launch Overall Im happy with the S7 edge Its met and in some ways surpassed my expectations as an upgrade to my older S5 I have been a long time iPhone user and purchased the Galaxy 7 Edge as a work device Its now the only device I use  with so many elements that are better than the iPhone 

Its incredibly easy to use The edge is fantastic when youre in a hurray Samsung Pay is the best thing since chocolate cake The camera is crazy good as well I could go on and on toobut I wont 

Go get one Youll love it Phone is fast camera takes great pictures I love everything about it There is so much you can do with the Galaxy S7 Edge that makes it almost worth the price Huge Step up from a S5 Faster sleeker and the display is gorgeous The phone picture capture is super fast and the pics look amazing the low light is nice but very grainy Have some weird issues with snapchat randomly closing or freezing I love the feel and look of this device it fits in the palm of hand The picture quality is amazing and This is my first Android phone former Samsung Windowsonly phone fan so I expected a bit of a learning curve However Ive been pleasantly surprised at how intuitive the controls and features are for someone whos new to the platform Love my new Galaxy S7 Edge Battery life was great But within a week my full charge only last about 1012 hours This is handsdown the fastest most impressive phone that I have ever owned The first three things that stick out to me are the battery life screen and the camera Ive had my phone on battery for 9 hours today and Im currently on 66 and Ive used it more than I normally do The screen is amazing and wows everyone that I show it to especially iPhone users The camera is one of the best features of the phone having a small child at home and catching those quick moments is important and this camera loads almost instantly Its a perfect phone Really the only issue I have with this phone is the lack of root SamsungVerizon need to stop locking the bootloaders or at least give you an option to unlock it yourself These phones are SOOO much better with root when you can uninstall bloatware and really make it YOURS If nothing else offer a DEVELOPER edition of EVERY phone you sell

Other than that the phone is great Awesome camera very speedy better battery life than my s6 and it even looks physically more refined Definitely an improvement Just fix that root thing and it is a 5 out of 5 as far as Im concerned I am very pleased with my purchase of the new Galaxy S7 the design of the phone itself makes you want to refrain from buying a case although I wouldnt suggest that So far the performance Ive experienced is exceptional Though I have noticed that my signal seems to be a little weak in many of the same places where I didnt have a problem with my S5 active Also the continued lack of a removable battery tells me Samsung isnt listening to its customers most of whom I know are angry about this feature going away with myself included Overall though Im happy with the phone and will undoubtedly remain a Samsung customer for a very long time The S7 Edge is amazing With the addition of the sd card larger battery water proofing and faster processor it is the perfect phone

I love it and highly recommend it Awesome phone with great features and a great battery I think Galaxy phones have always been top of the line and in fact almost everyone of my family members owns one its sleek modern design makes it easy to hold and show off I absolutely love my new phone The battery life is way better than the S5 or S6 and the black onyx is so sexy product has great features compared to past versions Coming from a Galaxy Nexus I was overdue for a new phone I had been pining over the new S7 offerings and when I received mine I was not disappointed Ive had it for a week and cannot get over how fast it is The display is very high quality and Samsung Pay is an added bonus The alwayson display is awesome too I can quickly glance and see time battery life and monthly calendar Batter life for days ok maybe one day but you know what I mean Its also waterproof Awesome and fast I havent even begun to use all the tools and applications Hands down the best phone of early 2016 Many people complain about bloatware but I think Samsung made the correct choice with the software they included I have previously owned the S5  S6 phones and the S7 is by far the best yet You will like the new curved feel in the hand the processor is lightning fast and the camera shots are second to none Samsung truly stepped it up super fast and awesome design love tje cameradisplay and waterproof Overall the performance of this phone is OK sub par compared to my old Samsung Galaxy S6 I feel as though there is some lag in the interface more so than other phones that Ive had The battery life is phenomenal however I can go approx 30 hours per day on one charge with my normal usage Other devices I would average 8 to 10 hours I love this product By far worth the upgrade The new curve on the back is a good feature And I really love the increased edge functionality and expandable memory The new S7 is a great new phone fast and the right size Not too big and not too small

The battery longevity is a little disappointing A bit better than my old Samsung S4 but not as good as I hoped 

I llke the interface updated but not so different from my last phone that I could not get used to it quickly I also like that fact that I can add an SD card and I like the waterproof feature which I hope I never have to rely on Ive owned 4 Samsung phones and tablet and enjoy using them all I like how they can all be linked together I was deciding between the Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 6 I wanted a phone with a good camera gorilla glass a large screen and a phone that was thin With this phone I got all of those features and more I am very happy with my s7 edge What a change going from a Samsung Galaxy 4 to the Galaxy 7 and Galaxy 7 Edge I didnt know what I was missing 
While the first S7 I received had I believe a defective battery and was returnedexchanged for a new one the battery life is truly amazing  and lasts until evening It was disappointing that the expected battery life wasnt there on the first phone I received However now that I have exchanged it the battery life truly is awesome I love the fast charging feature just give it just enough juice if Im in a crunch for time
Great idea having the SIM card and SD card slots all in one
The display is magnificent Pictures colors videos  brilliant
There are many functions that I havent even had time to figure out set or play around with Im sure it will take me an IT person some time before I find all of the features of this new phone
The camera is great Beautiful pictures with a variety of modes The Virtual Shot is very interesting
Love the Always On feature Even though many say to turn this feature off to save battery I feel that your battery will use MUCH more juice lighting up your entire screen with the brilliant colors and light every time you open your phone just to check the time 
I dont care for the Calendar  as I have not been able to set the snooze to a specific time  ie snooze for 5 minutes snooze for 10 minutes snooze for 30 minutes etc like I was able to do on the G4 The function may be there  I just havent found it yet
I dont like that the speaker is in the lower right cornerbottom of phone Typically  I only use one hand with my phone  when Im holding the phone with my right hand my pinky finger bracing the bottom it covers the speaker Reducing and sometimes garbling the sound I would suggest the speaker at the top
Other suggestions  give the messaging app the capabilities of more personalization along with delay sending for those of us that seem to send texts to the wrong people or notice misspelled words after message has been sent That would keep us from wanting to download third party apps
But Im loving my new Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 Edge I absolutely love this phone and I love that Samsung came to their senses and allowed for extra storage the design is beautiful and I love the double screen feature that allows for better viewing between website and apps on my main page would recommend to anybody looking to buy a new phone Title says it all Great features powerful device but better keep a soft touch when handling 

Even in a case no drops back glass is cracked after less than a week of ownership Ive been carrying a smartphone since the G1 and other than my daughter taking a bath with my G2 Ive never had any issue with mishandling my devices Hopefully Samsung will help resolve this So far overall the phone is great A few features were moved or removed many great improvements Your vr gear not so great only one focal adjustment I found other vr gears that have three focal adjustments for a 14 to 12 the price Also we should be able to use vr gear without wifi if we do choose Ive used galaxy phones for all my smart phones and I have been happy every time They are perfect Great features The best part of the phone is the Micro SD card and the water resistant features where brought back The edge has great features also The always on clock is wonderful save always picking up the phone Keep up the great work Samsung Samsung Does Not Disappoint Professional Sleek Reliable Fast with Fantastic Inclusive Accessories My next purchase will be a Samsung Im glad this time around that Samsung listened to the public and went back to the drawing board and added some much needed features to the phone On one note after i was getting use to Samsung Pay kinda disappointed that it wasnt on the phone from the beginning as well as the Samsung Music player But after it launched a quick download from the Play Store and im back in business The Music player was also available so i dont have to use data to play my songs on my phone If the phone had a removable battery and the home screen would turn landscape like the Galaxy 2 did this would be the most complete phone today The water resistance is great I left mine on the cabinet and my cup of water leaked and i panicked but forgot Samsung had me covered Thats why I have had over 10 devices with them and will continue to stay with them My mother and my boys love their Galaxy Tablets and one day Ill have my own The Galaxy VR Gear is Great I gave up my Note 5 for the 7 Edge and im not looking back Love my Micro SD Card Option Now i carry my own cloud with me of my stuff Have had the S7 Edge a week or so now So far I will like it I love the look with the metal and edge functionality is a great bonus Love my new phone takes great photos very fast So far now problems Absolutely LOVE this phone I had an S5 and refused to get the S6 because they got rid of the mircroSD slot I almost went to another brand of phone but when i research and found out Samsung was bringing back the microSD I was all on board again 

The phone feels great in your hand It feels like a high end phone that is well constructed It is highly durable and water resistant It moves seamlessly between apps and programs My biggest problem is the edge features really dont add much to the phone I can navigate my phone just as quick by going through regular means as opposed to using the edge feature Maybe Ill experiment with it some more in the future

The camera is exceedingly improved It snaps faster the pictures are better quality and it has less megapixelsgreat job Samsung You have virtual pics panoramic low light pics The video taking capabilities are off the change

Im very pleased with this phone I had lost faith in Samsung based off the S6 but they came back strong with the S7S7 Edgehonestly I cant wait to see what they do next year I really like samsung galaxy edge I can do just about anything with my phone thank you samsung Phone is awesome Im glad i got talked into getting it the camera is fabulous the features that come with the S7 Edge are great This phone is great It is fast and responsive The screen is absolutely gorgeous Been up all night exploring all its features The only concern I have is that my phone runs hot when its not even plugged up This is my 4th Samsung phone and i love it I cant put it down I can do everything i want  and the gold color is really a classy look for me I am always pleased with my Samsung purchases Thank you Samsung The phone was easy to set upbattery life is great Not a lot of accessories ready yet charges faststill finding great things about phone I upgraded from an s4 Active and gotta say this is a great phone Love the fact that they brought back the SD expansion slot and I do not have to deal with a rubber doggle for the power port was so annoying on the s4 active
Only con would be that with out a case I had a bit of trouble using 1 handed as my hand would hit the edge on either side before I touched the main screen for my selectionaction After I put a case on that is no longer an issue
I am extremely happy with my new s7 edge The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is a improvement from the previous versions The addition of the memory card slot is a super plus for me The phone in design is beautiful except for one thing the back it is a fingerprint magnet I have the phone with a cover but when I take it out to clean it the back gets dirty The phone physically looks great Watching video on it is a pure joy Its very responsive Love the tactile feedback from the screen and photos are amazing Good phone with an awesome camera Extremely powerful and good looking Glad I bought it I absolutely love the design and functionality of my S7 It was a much needed upgrade and Im completely satisfied The Galaxy s7 Edge is everything Samsung said it was I like the phone very much However it has one drawback it does not give me full and complete use and control of the Micro SD Card It does not let me manage the use of it the way I want It lets me only install a couple of my apps on it and it keeps almost everything on its internal memory The internet is abuzz with the fact that Samsung decided not to allow ADOPTABLE SD Card Storage on the new s7 phones I am hoping that an update to fix this is coming soon This is my first Android phone I moved first from iPhone then windows phone I love the galaxy edge It is perfect for my lifestyle I would recommend it to anyone I love my new Galaxy S7 Edge It is very light and easy to use I love all of the features it contains from the camera to how it records videos It is very fast and the best thing about it is that it has the capability to add an SD card I have no issues so far with the speed and the phone itself I would recommend It to anyone seeking a new android phone First off I miss the ability to have a removable battery though having the sd card back is awesome The phone gets quite hot under constant use so much so that it is uncomfortable to hold and gets laggy The software loaded on is not very optimized and uses quite a bit of memory at idle I have had it shut off on me and lock up a few times I would have liked to be able to pull the battery to reset as no button combinations seems to give a hard shut down

The battery life is terrible I have to leave it plugged in to charge as I am using it most of the time I can not wait till someone makes a decent battery case for it currently I can drain the battery in about an hour

The phone is fast part of the time other times it leaves me missing my note 3 with a custom rom on it I really wish samsung would unlock the bootloader for us and that Verizon would not make their apps mandatory

All in all if you are looking for a phone to browse the web and play a few games and nothing else this is the phone for you If you are looking for a day long work horse look elsewhere Samsung nailed it by bringing back the features that the user wants like water resistance expandable memory better camera and so on rather than experimental and unwanted features like 3d touch Processing seems better than 4 or 5 screen is really nice camera is awesome lots of fun features The main complaint I have is that at least once a day my phone thinks I have headphones plugged in and I cant get any sound out of it This is very annoying to deal with especially when using it for gps Nothing seems to work eventually it just starts working again Just picked up my new S7 a couple of weeks ago So far I love it though I am still getting used to the new setup I am coming from the S3 I love the camera and its new features I have yet tested the low light capability however I love it It keeps a charge and the edge design I love Very nice design and look to this phone The battery life is much much better than the S6 Edge Performance seems to be a lot better as well The phone looks amazing and has great features My only issue is the expensive cost of the phone Ive had the S4 and S6 this is far better and much easier to use This phone has a crystal clear screen lots of features and the camera is like none before If you dont already have yours I recommend you check them out and get one today I love this device It is so much more advanced than the 5 active I had It takes amazing pictures and video the sound quality is awesome and the battery life out last any phone Ive ever had I love the edge feature but I think both sides would be useful for something else Instead of one side 

The always on display uses alot of battery I wish I could control the brightness and the always in display doesnt show everything 

Other than that everything is great the phone is fast Ive been a galexy s fan all my life I love this phone I would never switch it Absolute love it Went from a note 4 to s7 edge No regrets Its light weight thin great size works great fast love everything about it The Samsung S7 Edge ready went above and beyond The extra storage alone is a must have Its water resistant so you can do all sorts of things in different environments and the camera is second to none The edge is the best of all I look at a lot of new one out there and nothing come close with all the new features the memory card I like I tell everyone I know how great this phone is in havent stop using my new phone thanks for making a great phone the phone is great everything is so beautiful however some details can be improved 1 the back panel made up of glass i assume is vulnerable to scratches does not effect use but looks annoying 2 the edge screen is vulnerable to accidental touches when the device is being held this problem could be solved with software 3 some times some system software crash but should be easily fixed When the s7 was initially announced i wasnt really sold on it to be honest I had a S5 and when comparing to the S7 the differences didnt seem like it was worth the cost of the phone When I was thinking about the main differences on paper are the 2k screen always on display upgraded specs CPU GPU RAM ect better camera on paper VR option with the GearVR and larger screenedge panel with the edge initially i wasnt sold on a larger device My S5 had a removable battery and great life still water resistance fingerprint scanner even though I never utilized it and I was still loving the screen quality Prior to seeing the device i had told myself and some friends that i wasnt going to upgrade

I went to look at the device in store and they were giving a demo on the GearVR It was very cool and the preorder promotion had me sold I preordered the edge and never looked back

Upon getting the phone the screen is definitely clearer and better than the S5 To me that was crazy because i have always loved how the S5 looked and really couldnt imagine getting better than that Samsung definitely hit a homerun with this screen The camera is really amazing and captures so much detail Anytime i hear specs or camera features I take it with a grain of salt I wasnt expecting a better camera and samsung delivered The edge panel support is still in its infancy but I do use some of the stock features samsung included and one of the 3rd party ones as well The VR capability with the GearVR is a niche product but it is really cool to use Like the edge panel its in its infancy and doesnt have a huge amount of apps or games yet but theres still quite a bit of stuff available now

One of the cons for me initially was the upgrade in screen size a bigger screen means a bigger device and I personally thought the S5 was perfect size wise Upon actually touching and feeling the edge its really not that much bigger The Edge display makes it so the screen is edge to edge and they were able to fit the larger screen on a smaller device Also some of the size comes from length so it isnt hard for me to hold or anything like that If anyone is holding out due to concerns that its too big of a device i really recommend holding a demo model in person and figuring it out for yourself It may be too big for your hands but for me it worked out Overall the phone is really great Its fast I havent come across any lag at all so far It fits nice in my hand not too heavy The screen is way more fragile though I upgraded from the galaxy s5 to the s7 edge Of course I should have never set my phone face down but I did it with my old phone so it was out of habit but when I set it down it cracked the entire screen and the frame I know what youre thinking but I didnt drop it at all I literally just set it down not even a half inch from the ground I didnt see one but it must have sat on a rock or something bc thats what it cracked like It looks like I dropped it from a two story building  the edge screen is really hard to protect even with a case due to the curve If you get this phone get a screen protector and a good one dont skimp on the protection to save money like I did Its not worth the 200  to fix it when you could have just spent 60 on protecting the thing  like I said overall a great phone but if you can deal with the slightly smaller battery go for the plain s7 The edge features were not as useful as I thought I switched from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and was very impressed I was first scared but I hated my iPhone and it was always giving me problems even with other ones in the past Each phone seems the same to me so I made the switch and I am so happy with my choice Its a little too big for my hands but I am tiny but other than that I love the features and the style of it The camera is awesome and also the battery life is amazing The charger that comes with it has my phone with a full battery within an hour Great phone This phone is great After a well overdue update from the Samsung Galaxy S4 I was very excited when I received this phone I love the new features and the battery is great The longest Ive gone so far with moderate to heavy usage was about 1314 hours without charging I appreciate Samsung for listening to customers and making sure that they provided for what people want The camera is amazing my friends are going to be using my phone to take all their pictures now which makes it great that I have expandable storage The Always On feature is great for classes especially when your professor doesnt want you to be on your phone but you need to check the time The display is beautiful and paired with the Gear VR Im totally enjoying the Samsung experience Upgraded from S5 and it was well worth it Display is gorgeous much faster camera is superb and battery life is very good Another great thing about is that the wireless charger works through the Specter case The fact that it is water proof is huge plus for me The only negative is the non removable battery but is a minor annoyance I can live with Would highly recommend getting one Best Samsung phone to date My first Samsung phone was the Samsung Nexus phone Ive had the Note 3 Note 4 Note 4 Edgelove that one also Galaxy S6edge Galaxy S6 Edge plus and not the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The best yet I did not get the note 5 because I love the edge screen Samsung really made this the best phone I ever had I though my Nexus 6P was the bomb This one takes the cake I will not get into specs you can read that other places Just want to laud Samsung for this baby Got my Gear S2 watch to pair it with And the Samsung fast charge wireless stand came todayLove it Keep up the good work Samsung and I will keep recommending and buying Samsung phones tvs tablets etc BTW I finally talked my brother into giving up the iPhone for one of these phones He loves it Im impressed by my Galaxy S7 Edge its a super fast phone that gave me options Im still exploring all the potential available with the phone but Im happy I preordered this piece of beauty Very good phone 
coming from my previous s3 and s4 I have used before
bought a stupid iphone after a year gave it to the third world
And gladly swith back to s7 
made me appreciate expandible sd card memory 
the very good useful camera
the only thing I cant do right now is transfer all my pictures and mp3 music files 
from a stupid macbook that wont communicate with my phone and other sd reader 
I need to burn this files to a cd then use a windows computer so I can do all this
and finally get away from the devil Apple

all of to many bloat ware in all ios and android stuff
only that on this android I can only disable some unlike stupid ios cannot even do that

having only 16g on my iPhone that uses 10g on stupid bloat ware that I have no intention to use like stupid stock market and I watch no intention of buying

Very useful on my everyday lifestyle I appreciate free vr and sd card thank you
the only thing not removable battery is negative This I must say is the best Galaxy phone yet It has a beautiful design Also they brought back the legendary MicroSD slot The camera is amazing especially the double tap home feature brings your camera right up I have the Galaxy S6 and was disappointed with the gear VR performance my phone was constantly get hot Now that I have the S7 I was on an 8hour flight and watched 3 movies and my phone didnt get hot Keep this up Samsung Ill be a fan 4 life I dropped my s5 dozens of times over the course of two years with no problems The S7 edge fell out of my pocket from 18 onto concrete in an otterbox and the screen cracked Over the years of adding features on one device and not including it on the next generation Samsung finally got it right

S7 is the best of every generation in one device

To state the obvious its fast beautiful in every way and the vast amount of features keep you happy and busy

The only reason I give it a 4 is while the battery is great and I mean great it doesnt live up to its full potential for whatever reason Android is sucking up a huge percentage of battery If Samsung is able to release a timely update this phone will truly be a 55 I love everything about this phone The look feel and features are amazing Premium materials best screen available biggest battery useful features and samsung quality Its just top notch The screen on my Samsung S5 was going out so I was just going to upgrade to an S6 but the store had none in Stock so I preordered the S7 and could not be happier Love the updated fratures especially Samsung Pay I am quite impressed with the build quality of the latest iteration of the Galaxy Line of cellular phones The screen size is perfect and fits well in my hand and my jeans pocket The Edge notifications work really quite well and the display is sharp and bright The response time and application performance is impressive as well as the implementation of the Gear VR However that said the phone does get warm at times and limiting the internal memory to 32gb did not make sense from an economical sense given the cost of flash memory a la 2016 It is nice that the microSD slot was brought back however many of the apps use a lot of storage space This phone is awesome Phone camera power battery are all great I love my new phone I had THOUGHT my old phone was the best but the new Samsung 7 Edge outdoes my old phone by far Takes great pics The graphics in games is great Easy to use Plenty of help available if I need it My pictures look very nice and I love all the new features of this phone The water proof is awesome The new galaxy S7 has a larger battery for more life and it is more water proofed which makes it ideal for my everyday usage as I like to hunt and fish And looking forward to using the VR functions a great additional purpose The Galaxy S7 is a fine piece of equipment Water resistant removable storage and an excellent camera I have finally crossed over to the 21st century and bought my very first smartphone I did a lot of investigation by reading reviews watching videos and friends and families opinions and decided that if I finally get a new smartphone is was going to be the best and newest out there so I chose the Samsung S7 Edge I liked the way the phone feels in my hand I have tried other phones before my decision and they all felt like I would maybe drop them one day and that could get expensive When I looked at the display it was bright and easily to view icons and pictures and so forth Speaking of pictures I have never taken pictures with my old phones because the quality was not worth taking or keeping on my phone Now I take pictures all the time the quality is amazing I am also glad there is a memory expansion slot exists on this phone for the SD card so I can keep my pictures and other types of data stored on instead of worrying about running out of room on the actual hard drive of the phone This phone is incredible I really appreciate the long battery life as I have only had to recharge my phone maybe 3 to 4 times a week  I am sure I may have to recharge more once I really start using more options I havent even got into yet I really do not have any negative things to say the Galaxy S7 edge other than the touch screen is a little too sensitive for me I talked with others who have the Samsung Galaxy S6 and was told there is a setting to desensitize the touch screen but I could not find it on the phone I contacted support and they told me that the option for that was left off for this model That is unfortunate as that would have made me consider this to be the BEST phone ever 100 Still I do love my new Samsung S7 edge Pros
Nice design slim fast cpu
Bigger battery 3000 mAh
Better camera bright screen microSD slot 

Cons 
Battery doesnt last long with the bigger capacity
Bluetooth sound quality is worst than my old Galaxy Note 3 when pairing to my 14 Mustang GT Premium sound system Fix BT streaming quality please
High resolution 1440p screen drain battery faster please keep it at 1080p Samsung People cannot tell the difference between 1080p and 4k resolution on such a tiny screen Higher resolution kills battery much faster We value more on battery life than higher resolution screen
No USBC port are you kidding me This should be the new standard on all mobile devices and computers
Need to shrink the empty area where the logo is at on the front and the Home button area so the phone is more compact on next phone S8
Adding a microSD card drain battery a little faster when phone not in use standby time
Always on display is nice but drain battery faster so I turned it off

I will update further if I find more reasons to do so Love the phone and look
Camera is great love the pics and video and fast charging is great Great phone Love the size and weight Speed and connection reliability are awesome Hate the locked boatloader Really why I upgraded from a Samsung S3 to the S7 Big difference in features and quality Photos are awesome Feels good in my hand Many options available I love this phone The features are great The camera on here is amazing I cant believe how fast it is Its literally like having a laptop in your hand I cant wait to get the V R Gear I actually sold the phone to two ATT customer service people telling them a out it I used to have a Galaxy S6 and was quite disappointed at the overall battery life With the S7 Edge I have not needed to charge it besides when I go to bed even with a full days use A real full days use

The edge display is slightly hard to get used to and my palm is causing some features to not work correctly but this seems fixed with the new patch or at least less sensitive

The glass does show fingerprints a lot so be sure to get a sleek case

The camera is extremely quick at focusing and is very good in low light environments like pubs and clubs

Overall worth the money I love this phone I have and numerous Samsung phones and products This one is up at the top of the list I can multitask with ease making responding to texts while in the middle of other actions super convenient Switching between apps is extremely fast and smooth The double tap to open the camera has been clutch for me as I take a million pictures of my dogs at any given moment The fact its water resistant is just extra since I dont have ti even think about it inclimate weather Im in love Love the phone great features feels rugged nice design Hate the locked boatloader This is a great with a whole lot of new features and updates Nice design I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 so it is quite a step up I am very glad the option for the micro SD is back and the water resistant feature was a good selling point I think it is great great picture battery live is good wireless recharging is awesome and looking forward to trying out the VR headset when it arrives I have not got to test out all the features yet but looking forward to it Expensive little toy but so far very worth it I do miss being able to go from the last screen to 1st screen in a continuous left swipe but will manage The video capture with the still photo is pretty cool I also hope that Samsung will allow you to incorporate the micro SD memory into the Android system so your 32 GB phone can be a 64 or 96 or 160 or 232 GB without having to use the file manager when the phone memory eventually fills up read about this someplace and sounds like it would be a nice update since you could not buy a 64 GB phone Overall though very happy I love Samsung products Ive had a galaxy for 8 years and always seem to upgrade for the newer one Features are awesome and they are durable Ive thrown my phone on the floor or against the wall before and didnt break on me Nice Phone the edge looks cool but the screen protector I have on it is already peeling up on all 4 corners The battery life seems good so far and wired charging is fast Wireless charging overnight is pretty neat Disappointed that the phone keeps disconnecting from my WiFi and from my Samsung activity tracker Very stylish I love the new antithief feature that was added along with google Ive always loved the Galaxy series but the S7 is the best one so far I discover something new I like about it everyday WORST PHONE I TRIED WORST WORST WORSTthe battery constantly over heats I can fry an egg on this phone AND I use phone case all the time and once the overheating was so outrageous I removed the case to check on the back I found a crack in that cheap so called gorilla glassmore like cheap plastic and I never even dropped this phone This phone is so bad its unbelievable WILL NEVER BUY PHONE BY SAMSUNG AGAIN EVER I recently upgraded from my Galaxy S6 active and I must say that this phone is much much faster and the battery life is great I have 3 issues with this phone but over all I still really like it The first issue is the edge sensitivity the screen become non responsive when trying to take picture or while using the phone laying down due to where you fingers and hands have to grip during these activities I was able to fix this issue by buying a case but it takes away from the sleek look and feel of the phone maybe they can add a setting like to disable the edge like screen rotate The second issue is not a hardware issue its the lack of smime email security for imap and pop mail servers I use my phone quite a bit for work and I have to rely on 3rd party applications for email encryption security or deploy a Microsoft server which is not an option for my business I was hoping that with the introduction of Knox this issue would have been fixed My third issue is due to the screen mirroring to chrome cast because the connection drops often I chose to try to connect my new S7 to my tv hdmi via my micro usb to hdmi cord that worked with the s3 but they dropped this support I guess I need to find a better screen mirroring device for the phone to connect to but that cable was super handy when traveling without the need to setup a WiFi network to connect all the devices I hope this review is helpful and helps samsung keep making better and better phones It was love at 1st sight when I eyed the new Samsung S7 It was at SXSW and If you check out my twitter Savartie you will see the videos I took at different concerts with my phone The quality was so good that I had people sharing my videos for their friends to see Water Proof or Beer Proof Wireless charging and capabilities that exceed your own preferences and allow you to go Big because this wishes and thoughts are now Reality I had a Galaxy S5 thought it was the best Then the S6 came out I really didnt like it much Then the S7 came out and it out does the S5 I wasnt going to get a different phone until they made them water resistant again Glad Samsung brought back the water resistant and much much more Thanks Samsung I got my first smart phone when I was 25 and went with the only option available at that time Ever since that mistake I have been an android and more importantly an Samsung user I had the Mega for several years and refused to change till Samsung came back out with external storage and low and behold the galaxy s7 edge has arived Since the first phone I had not purchased brand new hot off the presses phone Let me tell you I LOVE this phone I use the phone a lot during the day and the battery is amazing I got the gold one and its a sexy phone I must say The camera is awesome was sitting in the back row at the kids school and was able to zoom in and take clear photos I just cant say enough about this s7 edge device The camera is so clear I love it Where I live it rains a lot and I ran through the parking lot during a downpour and the phone got drenched and still worked Ill never owned a different phone Wonderful phone Easy to use and love the bigger screen Upgraded from my galaxy S5 Amazing fit and finish MUCH faster processor and beautiful display Ive received several inquiries as to the make and model of my phone Very pleased with the new and returned features of this phone This is my first edge phone I was really reluctant on getting one because I work in a physical environment I heard all the horror stories about how the edge phones arent durable Well Ive had mine for 2 weeks now and dropped it twice on Railroad rock and guess what not even a scratch All the features are great and the phone is really fast Samsung has topped my expectations again Great phone with good battery life They brought back water resistance and the external SD card which is a big deal When I first received the phone it ran pretty hot after using the cord to transfer my stuff from my old phone itll run hot every now and then but other than that the phone works perfectly I love everything about this phone The display on the edge is impressie I love the sleek  attractive look of the phone as well This is my third Samsung phone and they just keep getting better I cant wait to use my VR headset with it I am now a total Samsung Galaxy convert I love my new S7 edge I was leery about changing from my long time iphone but now I am so very glad I did All of the features are easier to use and make more sense then anything that the iphone did You can do more in less time and its such a smooth transition from one thing to another Yes there was a little learning curve and I am still finding new and exciting things about my phone I plan to stick with Samsung from here on out All I can say is  I LOVE IT I have veen with the galaxy family since the beginning Each phone gets better and the S7 is no exception Best camera best display best battery life best almost everything Love my phone I had Samsung for 5 yearseach year the features are great Ive only had this phone for about 2 weeks now and so far find great improvement over my old Galaxy lll
Im still trying to figure out which of the duplicate apps to keep Battery life is ok but some apps still will drain it quickly if left on Its a great phone but with a premium price If it last as long as my Galaxy lll which still works fine it will be worth it i suppose So far Im attached to this phone 100 Before I used to split my time online with my laptop and tablet But since the s7 is fast and loads everything in a matter of seconds I dont really have any reason to switch to another device I love the fact that I can use it while is raining or close to a water bottle because is waterproof and nothing will happen The return of the sd card is a plus too Now I can shoot as much video as I want  And download games and apps The gear vr is amazing and Im hoping it evolves overtime To be fair this is my third Galaxy phone However I was not sold on the S6 when it came out I questioned the lack of removable battery and no ability to expand the memory The lack of water resistance also added to my hesitation However when I heard about the imminent release of the S7 I knew it was the device I had been waiting for 

It has everything Id yearned for in the S6 plus the elements I loved in my S5 I preordered and have been beyond pleased since receiving my device Beautifully designed and with features I didnt realize I needed Gorgeous lowlight photos solid feel phenomenal battery life and perfect size as well And the HD call quality cant be beat 

I am extremely pleased with my purchase and even bought an S7 for my brother I highly recommend this phone Love this phone Great size not to big Like the different font sizes easy to read Easy to use and very easy to transfer over from other phone Like the edge features I wanted a phone that had a uhd display and shot 1080p 60 fps video The S7 does that and looks great and feels quality This phone has a great camera is speedy and has many great features It is great that they brought back features such as expandable storage and water proofing I think this is one of the best phones out there and I love that its waterproof when I upgraded form the S6 Edge top the S7 Edge I resigned myself to cosmetic changes and minimal powercamera upgrades but the S7 Edge went into the stratosphere with the upgrade The camera catches motion pics light years ahead of the S6 edge and the normally paltry battery power is at least 3 times more powerful The startup is in seconds and the apps actually work out of the box the ability to easily switch apps changes appearances as well as run dozens of apps at once without lag is amazing I love this phone I was already hooked on the Galaxy S family but you have a member for life now thank you Samsung Phone is great camera is very nice Just really miss the option for the TV remote I was using the Samsung S6 active before I upgraded to the S7 edge The S6 was a great phone I do a lot of field work and even without a case it stood up to some pretty harsh treatment with no issues The day I received the S7 before even making my first call my son who was just as excited as I was took it over to show my wife doing dishes at the sink You just it plunk My wife freaked as she has an iPhone and this would have been disastrous I reached in dried it off with towel and called our home phone NO ISSUES As for the phone itself first off it works great as a phone the camera is awesome and Samsung Pay keeps amazing vendors who tell me never seen that work here The battery life seems a little shorter than the S6 but I am still playing around with it Samsung did improve the wireless charging My S6 had to be in just the right position or it would startstop constantly The S7 just works Overall the S7 feels great in your hand slim and comfortable to use I have been with Samsung since Galaxy and this time they do everything that needs to be the beast As my title states Samsung has definitely outdone themselves this time around The phone design is absolutely beautiful Theyve improved how it feels in the hand and with curved edge coming from the back The screen as always is breathtaking and the focus on this camera is out of this world on point What will they come up with next Battery life has drastically improved thank you Samsung Coupled with the return of the expandable memory and waterdust protection its the complete package I love the phone Its very fast and has tons of features to play with to make the phone quick to use no matter what options your seeking to use Edge screen is also a nifty way to add shortcuts to get to what you need quickly Only downside is its hard to type with one hand without bumping the edges with you palm if you have a case on Plus hard to hold the phone sideways to view videos with bumping the edges Camera makes awesome pictures and videos Love the water proofing and quick wired and wireless charging I really miss the IR blaster though Pretty steep retail price especially with only 32 gb Had to do it not to lose my unlimited data I am happy to have my SD card slot back though All in all after owning the S3 and S5 this is the best one yet I am a long time Samsung owner I simply love the S7 all the features fit well into my life I do work outside so being waterproof is excellent The camera is so much better than the S6 the battery life is excellent and the wireless charging is so convenient The virtual reality Oculus is beyond my expectations  I highly recommend the S7 everyone The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is such a multfeatured device and has so many solutions available that you could not ask for more Im so happy with my new phone specially with the camera since i love taking pictures I love my new phone This phone does everything I ask of it Amazing clarity functionality everything I really love the design and its fast great camera plus extended memory slot cant go wrong
I love that is water resistant good for taking pictures under water I absolutely LOVE this phone It has a very sexy look and great features Takes great pictures The Samsung Galaxy S7 is such a refreshing intuitive device that seamlessly blends form and function
The technology contained within this thin beautiful device makes life easy and uncomplicated
I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to the S7 and Samsung fixed the issues it had and polished the things it did well
The fingerprint recognition is far better in this version than the previous making it a fun and easy way to secure my device
The camera blows away the competition it may not have as high megapixels but the lowlights functionality and the overall aperture makes pictures look inherently beautiful and true to life
The curve is a small but elegant addition to the device and adds small subtle changes to reading the news and watching a video that are aesthetically pleasing

All in all this is a device for the next generation Beautiful person I love it Upgraded from the Galaxy S5 and its the best upgrade Ticks me off because itll act slow some times Camera is unbelievable The water resistant is no joke I texted outside while drops of rain was pouring on my phone I recommend this phone over any iPhone Get this phone now Im less than a month and so far so good 
Phone is great although carrier bloat ware and preinstalled apps do sucks especially after praying full price
Battery life you can see more than 4 hours of screen on time which is awestmed

Only time will tell if the phone gets timely updates to Android N 

Ultimately a solid phone and would recommend Ive had this phone for a couple of weeks and have not have any problems Its a great phone so far Battery life is good Good job Samsung I have been using a cracked GS5 for 6 months because I refused to use my upgrade on anything other than the GS7 and I have got to say I am SO glad I did it was definitely worth the wait

I love how fast it is and some of the enhancements like the ability to split screen are definitely a huge bonus to me I was a little skeptical about the camera being downgraded from 16MP to 12MP but the the only difference Ive seen in quality is that the lower resolution pics come out way better than the pictures Ive taken with my GS5

I have had every phone in the Galaxy Line from the orginal Galaxy all the way up to the S6 Edge and the GS7 is by far my favorite Love it Very impressed with the s7 edge it operates so smooth and easy to get used to It is great everything This phone makes it possible for multitasking a lot easier The design is beautiful The curved display is not only unique but its still very useful Camera sound and pretty much the whole thing overall is awesome Overall this is a great phone It does everything you need a phone to do and then some
Pros
Takes amazing pictures and videos  the low light functionality is fantastic
Nice to have the expandable memory back
I like the peace of mind that it is water resistant
Works great with the S2 watch
Cons
Cant auto sort or alpha sort your favorite phone numbers 
Cant removereplace the battery
Gets hot when using with the Gear VR This phone is great and functions well in the rain Its very fast transitioning from home screen to Internet All apps open well and the Camara is the best Camara by far then any other smart phone I had The storage space is efficient with the ability to add with the micro SD option I do in fact use it but to be honest I dont need it it right now But Im sure I will later Knowing the option is there allows me to take photos randomly with out the worry of space 
The platinum gold looks better in person and I am glad I chose the color Great job Samsung You have officially built the best smart phone in the market right now I am happy to own one Beautiful Phone I love everything about the phone I upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S5 I absolutely love everything about this phone I get real all day battery life and it is super fast I love the new features on the S7 Im coming from using the S4 The camera selfie mode is really nice and it makes it easier to do group pictures too The file system turned out a lot easier than I thought When transferring from the S4 to the S7 the mini adapter made it so much easier and faster to move all of my things from one phone to another The directions on how to use every new feature is well explained so I dont get confused trying to use them which is a big plus for me So far I am LOVING my S7 I cant think of anything I dont like about this phone
Battery last all day with heavy usage and lots of screen time Size is great not too big not too small I can notice a huge difference in speed and the clarity on screen is great The thing I find most impressive is the quality and speed of the camera They changed a few of the settings with is confusing at first i upgraded from a G s5 to a G s7 though i do love the new phone for its beautiful design two things about the change i dislike

1 Removed the IR blaster like why my most used application on my GS5 was the IR blaster PEAL remote i used it to control my TV Surround Sound cable box even my AC unit could be operated via the app 
The lack of a IR blaster ALMOST kept me from upgrading If the OS of the GS5 wasnt so deteriorated i would never have upgraded 

2 Moved the location of the speaker from the back of the phone to the bottom of it
Having the speaker on the bottom of the phone created a natural acoustic when placed on a flat surface making it quite loud when playing music or movies

I do hope by the next generation this will be resolved with a smaller display To start the camera is amazing I can finally take night pictures that look good The phone is durable fast and light I love it so much In the past year Ive tried the IPhone 6 and 6 plus and the Samsung Note 5 The 7 Edge is by far the best I love the compact size for being a 55 inch screen The iPhone 6 plus is a nice phone but it feels huge in comparison to the S 7 Edge The Edge gets some getting used to and I still bump the screen on accident because of the design However the edge also helps make this phone more compact which is a huge benefit 

The battery life is solid It lasts the entire day unless I have the screen on nonstop Wireless charging allows me to effortlessly keep the battery charged in my office all day so when I leave for the day I have a full battery if I go out for the night 

The screen is beautiful Images and words are crisp and clear The camera works great Its fast and clear Ive read comparisons between the S7 and IPhone 6 plus cameras From what Ive read both cameras are great It depends on the mode and lighting So far Im very happy with this camera 

The S7 is fast Ive had no lag when using it for normal use I felt some lag with my IPhone 6 plus and the Note 5 Im delighted by the speed and response of the S7

The waterproof feature is nice It wasnt a deal breaker for me I guess if I drop my phone in the toilet I may feel differently  Ive never dropped a phone in the water but I guess it could happen

The removable storage is great Very happy Samsung brought it back

This is the best phone Ive ever had Im very pleased I love this phone It is sleek light and amazing Ive had my S7 for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with it It has a bright vibrant screen and it is incredibly fast Apps open much more quickly than on my S5 I have been a Samsung user for a few years now I upgraded from my Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy S7 Edge and I love it I love that its water resistant so Im less worried about getting it wet  one reason I did not upgrade to the S6 I am also thrilled that the expandable storage is back I run out of space easily between apps and photos but with the expandable storage I wont have to worry I absolutely adore the color its sleek and looks high end I have had a couple times where the phone seems to lag out on ne but it doesnt last long and kicks right back in But its never gotten hot on me even after playing games for an extended amount of time Its a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone I absolutely love this phone the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone The fast charging the battery last longer Camera is the best This phone is the best I cant get to put it down it gorgeous design is unique The feel style and quality is superb Good investment Beautiful phone super fast Definitely recommend Big improvement from my s5 Title says it all The s7 edge has it all perfect phone Absolutely love it This is a fantastic phone Both the 7 and the 7edge are the best phones I settled on the 7 because of the size I use to like the iphone but after samsung put the 7 out I am HOOKED I have a 64gb chip in mine now and I am happy The fingerprint function is so much better on the samsung then the iphone Everything about this phone is just ULTIMATE LOVE IT THANKS SAMSUNG Having used this phone since the launch it has been the most reliable Galaxy phone I have had The battery life is excellent even more so when compared to the lackluster battery life on the S6 Every program seems to load almost instantly with very little lag The display is extremely bright but again does not appear to be a drag on the battery life The phone size is very thin even with my protective case on it Overall I would recommend this phone Preordered the S7 to replace my Moto Razor MAXX I was hoping that I would still get the battery life of the MAXX and I am not disappointed The screen is bright and clear performance is great and the interface is intuitive Loving my new S7 The s7 edge is the truth It has all of the latest technology that you may need Everything is right at your fingertips Love the camera features and the battery life Can go all day at work without running the battery down The appearance of device is good I was so excited to get it The camera is awesome and also the screen But the os is not intelligent enough The battery is draining quickly Galaxy S7  i am liking it more day by day smooth and fast performance opening apps browsing what not all i do in my new phone its simply superb looking in gold color with wireless charging support and samsung pay It holds charge for me more than a day camera is nice and takes clear piks without lag And new way of taking selfies with hand gesture back camera sensor tap are awesome add onsi ams still exploring  hope i get every day a new way to find the best out of my Galaxy S7  

Cheers  Thanks Samsung  This is definitely the best smart phone Ive owned The performance of the phone is excellent battery life is outstanding and everything about it is great This phone is beautiful powerful and everything Ive been asking forEven though its bigger its a lot more comfortableGreat cameragreat displaylove always on feature Overall great experience This phone has awesome features
Has a great screen and is very light 
The camera on it is phenomenal This is my second Samsung phone and I really like it The display is slightly larger than the 4s I had which lasted very well I was tempted to the upgrade with the combo package of the Oculus VR which is a lot of fun with the phone Samsung Health is another plus It reads heart rate S02 Stress activity and so on The screen is nice and bright Pictures have always been superior and continue to be so with the newly designed camera Email handling is easy and you can easily delete all emails in bulk if you wish Id highly recommend this phone to anyone I have had an issue with it freezing up Its sort of weird because its the action buttons on the bottom that do not respond For instance every morning I press the Home button to get into the phone That doesnt work I can press the power button and get in though So Ill go to an app but once in I cannot get back to the home screen use the back button or the app window button So I have to reset it each time it does this sometimes up to 3 times a day I am sure it is a software glitch as I have replaced the phone once already and both have done this Samsung once again has shown its commitment to excellence with the new S7 Edge Technologically advance smooth design and water resistant make this the phone to own and the additional battery power is awesome Phone runs all day without the need to charge They continue to keep my business Due to not buying a case when i purchased phone three days later i accidentally dropped phone and shattered back cover and i am waiting for repair to be made I like the size of this phone with its gorgeous screen and great camera Adding water resistance is a nice plus but I hope I never have to test that feature Next year perhaps the IR feature will return along with the ability to use a replacement battery I love how smooth and quick everything is in my new S7 edge The best phone I ever bought  The camera is fast and it takes amazing pictures Great for movies with the long lasting battery This phone has been completely amazing I use it for anything I need The VR attachment works extremely well I have already switched a friend over to the Galaxy and they have been happy ever since Thank you for this experience cant wait to see what is to come next The design is excellent battery life is excellent The Price is reasonable highly recommended it Size  feel is great sleek Camera is wonderfu Love the Edge screen have had friends look at the screen  say wow love the full screen Getting familiar with my new Edge S7 has been very easy
Thank you Phone is great still trying 2 get use to it loving it more n more each day GonnA take some getting to no her better This phone is neat perfection for right now Its still just as sexy as when I bought it Its a great phone with great features and I still love it It still feels like a new phone Im still learning about the features and how awesome they are but its great to be continously shocked by what else it could do Im so happy with my phone So far this device has been amazing Speed quality design features are all amazing Very nice devise great battery life sound is crispy clear Great Phone 2nd Phone because 1st would not hold SD card securely in place Replacement works great Exactly what I expected from Samsung but a little better More sturdy feel better camera better touch screen better sound Would have given 5 stars on the design except for the mini SD tray its a little troublesome opening Not in love with SideSync either but Ill get use to it All in all the best yet The first Samsung phone I had was the S5 An excellent phone and it sold me on Samsung products in general I passed on the S6 because of the non removable memory not something I want When information came out about the S7 having a removable memory I was interested After reviewing the specs I preordered the edge version from Verizon My kids joked with me youll be sending it back in a week I am a very picky consumer If I buy a product and it does not meet my expectations it goes back Needless to say I still have my S7 Edge a great phone highly recommend it to anyone Samsung has done a great job with the product I just bought it 14 days back and have charged it for 2 times onlyWithout ultra power savings its giving 10 days battery life

Phone doesnt lag anywhere while using

Also Samsung Pay is one secret weapon
Its works everywhere instead using card you can use phone

Camera is also awesome Upgrade from Samsung Note 2 Screen clarity very good Waited until SD card expansion returned Not too many prepackaged apps from phone vendor to work around Always on clock is nice should be on my Gear 2 watch as well  very handy I love that I can expand the memory the feel is great in your hand quick response to touch It is easy to be broken after I get it by 3 days it back broken that was the poores one I get
I have before Galaxy 3 And note3 and note edge and that was the 4 but it was so bad I have gone from the S3 to the S5 and now to the S7 I really do love the Galaxy line of products and have always been for the most part very satisfied However though this may be just a problem with my phone I have had to recharge my battery a couple times a day This is not while doing constant surfing or reading or anything that is very power hungry I dont use the S7 any more than I used the S5 but the battery seems to run down twice as fast 
 On the other hand this is a very comfortable phone that feels good in my hand and so far has performed very well 
 My only real gripe besides the battery issue is not being able to set my homepages to loop around This is a great phone Samsung pay works well Has a lot of features I havent even begun to use yet The only thing I dont like is the bloat ware from ATT that cannot be removed The phone is fantastic in do many ways The only thing I dont like is the easy the memorySim card slot opens But I cant find any other problems with it I like display I like feel I like rams sound can be better still not bad Materials used are top notch Way more substantial than the S5 that I upgraded from Size is perfect Glad they went back to allowing a microSD card Camera is great Speaker location doesnt seem ideal especially when holding phone in landscape moe for games or videos Upgraded from S5 active to S7 Lightning fast thinner great camera that can also save photos as a raw file More internal memory added my 128 GB micro SD card from my other phone Overall a great phone all around This phone maintains the great appearance of the s6 and improves on everything else Better battery life doesnt get as hot has an SD card slot comes with water resistance and the phone itself is much better to hold Im very happy with this phone If you liked the s6 this phone is definitely going to be for you For everyone else who hasnt had an s6 before this is probably the best phone out right now The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is the best smartphone out there right now Its beautiful display and built nakes the phone so premium The hardware makes it one of the fastest phone these days With its battery I can last a whole day The camera is absolutely the best with the super fast autofocus and its aperture can take great pictures in lowlight In addition the SD card slot is back adding even more storage The IP68 rating just tops it off I recommend this to anyone who wants a beautiful phone that will also suit your everyday needs As someone who has had an iPhone for quite a while I was extremely skeptical about making the switch but I now question why I didnt do it sooner So far this phone performs beautifully and I have no problem getting a full day from the battery The camera is wonderful and has a great representation of colors The s7 is definitely a good option for anyone and has been a joy to use Excellent battery life and camera takes great photosvideos I have been a Samsung owner since the note 2 and have not been able to find anything that compares The water resistant is a great return feature I skipped the note 5 due to lack of external battery removed and SD card Ive stuck by my note 4 until the s7 edge The feel of premium is great Noting better Cant wait to see what the Note 6 will bring The galaxy s7 edge in my opinion and my experience for me didnt quite live up to all the hype Yes the camera works great and takes great pictures Its usually pretty fast responding from time to time it gets slow and sluggish and doesnt want to respond right away Ive had it restart on me by itself automatically The biggest issue for me is the battery life With it on airplane mode and background apps restricted and in power saving mode I get close to maybe 1213 hours of battery life and thats if i dont use it too much If I use it i get less than 13 hours An issue with it being slow is happening as I type Im typing and its taking a few seconds for words to show up and if I need to delete it takes a few seconds for the phone to respond to delete Ive done a hard reset a couple times and done a factory reset twice and no change It didnt seem to help any in doing so the edge makes this phone look really nice good phone Samsung continues to manufacture products that offer excellent value rewarding operability This phone is my fifth Samsung product purchased in the past two years All are dependable and offer longterm usability Thank you Samsung Overall a really good phone Camera is def better that the one I had in my S5 The first week my battery was depleting extremely fast but has since got better This phone replaced my Note Edge which I really enjoyed but battery life wasnt great and the camera was really slow The S7 Edge is very fast and the camera is great Now I know I can get the shot basically as soon as I pull the phone out its really quick Battery life has been great so overall Im extremely pleased and this is the best Galaxy phone Ive ever had I recently upgraded from the S4 to the S7 the reason being that the S4 was still such a great phone even having OS updates that increased the phones speed The models in between were ok but didnt blow me away until the S7 was revealed This really is one of the best models this year and in years to come From the slick design to the comfort in your hand this phone does everything very well I have one gripe that they took out IR sensors that would operate tvs and stereos and also the hover feature that gave information hovering over items such as email I would love if those things returned The improved and new features such as always on themes and edge options are a fresh look at Galaxy devices and I am interested in the direction Samsung will take it I would highly recommend the edge option only because it really does give the impression of a phone different than everything else on the market I recently upgraded from a galaxy s5 and I am very happy with my choice so far The screen is amazing and bright Really gives a pop to anything I am doing on my phone The larger internal memory is very nice to have an assortment of apps games at my finger tips Also I liked that my s5 was water resistant but the little flap was doomed to break off The s7 edge being water resistant without any additional plugs is the best of both worlds One thing I really miss however is the IR blaster that my s5 had Its a minor things and maybe most people dont use it but I liked having a remote to any TV right in my pocket Overall its a great phone and I am very happy with my upgrade Great camera in all conditions
Stunning design
Sharp vibrant display Compared to using a Samsung Galaxy S3S6 this phone is more than expected I really enjoy the expandable memory without making the phone too thick Perfect size to fit in my hand and pocket with really good battery life Even when your battery is getting low theres an ultra power saving setting to make it last longer without sacrificing calls and texts Theres a lot of features but the ones that stood out are that this phone is water resistant and pretty durable The Always On Display is a nice feature that does not drain the battery too much and has a small notification about time and messages when displayed Its basically a locked screen saver I recommend getting this phone if youre a AndroidSamsungGalaxy user I feel like the few things I didnt like in my S5 were fixed in this phone I love it Make sure you get a case because if you havent had an Edge before it can be a little awkward in the hands Best phone Ive ever had This phone has many great aspects Great camera newest technology etc It is still laggy from time to time that I did not get with my note 5 The always on screen is severely flawed as Samsung will only allow their apps to show up on the screen I use google messages and so my notifications will not show up on the always on screen I have since turned it off What is the point The edge screen to me is a novelty that I really need to force myself to use Maybe just coming out with a 55 in s7 would have just been better This phone is very awesome The few enhancements samsung made has made all the difference The battery is so much better and there is not enough I can say about the camera totally amazing Im absolutely in love with my phone I love the way it looks and operates I love the side apps I only have a few issues but theyre miner I would go wider and a little shorter with the screen I have to really stretch to reach the top with my thumb My phone keeps telling me Im connected to a USB device when its not plugged into anything The s7 is awesome it is fast and smooth and the camer is fanominal the only down side is the curved glass on display makes screen protection non existent Great phone Slim form factor Not heavy Traded Up from the Note II this is a much better phone Its fast I havent experienced any application issue with more than 100 apps installed Battery life is incredible I havent tried a stress test on it but it last all day and i can check email on several POP3 and Mapi accounts all day Im hooked I use my phone all day and night on one charge I dont worry about the battery icon any more like I used to I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the S7 The change was unbelievable The phone has met and exceeded my expectations especially on the camera I rely heavily on my camera as a way to keep contact with family members afar Thank you for making such a great phone Overall a great poem but the battery life doesnt seem to last as long as it should Iphone user for years beat switch I ever made The Samsung S7 Edge is amazing My phone will not load anything over wifi if the Bluetooth feature is enabled if I turn off my Bluetooth then things will load
 This needs fixed immediately I have used this phone for approximately two weeks and have been amazed by how well it functions Very stylish and easy to use Battery life has been excellent so far This is an amazing phone I had the Note 4 I wanted a smaller device without sacrificing much as far as screen size and functionality This S7 edge did just that for me Not to mention the water resistance expandable storage and gear vr that came with it This is a great phone and overall I am very pleased with it Transferring everything from my old phone to this one was much easier and painless than expected The screen is very clear and vibrant The camera is top notch Battery life is comparable to my old s4 with an extended battery in it I only have three small complaints so far 1 This version of Android does not have a music player like my old one did I downloaded one from the play store and problem solved 2 The ear buds it comes with do not block out any background noise which makes it hard to use them in noisy areas 3 Probably the biggest issue Although the speaker on the phone is loud and clear the one used for regular calls is not very loud at all I like how the S7 operates compared to my S5 However the edges of the S7 Edge are a bit too sensitive for me Trying to find a way just to hold the phone in your hand when trying to do anything without triggering the phone to do other things that totally interrupt what you were intending to do in the first place is never ending The encryption for security purposes is nice which prevents the phone from being accessed used or reprogrammed if stolen Cameras are awesome Major improvement over my dying s6 from less than a year ago This will be my 5th Samsung device in 7 years Ive gone through the Galaxy S3S7 and Own a Note 101 2014 Edition This is by far my favorite phone of all Thank you Samsung for returning the Expandable Memory and Waterproofing When comparing to the S6 the camera on the S7 is close to blending with the back wall doesnt stick out much Ive been an iPhone guy for years I finally made the switch and I couldnt be more excited about my decision Aside from group texting issues that Im still working on mastering since the majority of my friends are still carrying Iphones I have been blown away by the capabilities of this phone I love the display I love the feel I love the camera I love the size I love the application options the list goes on and on It feels like the sky is the limit with this phone Im so glad to be a Samsung owner now I feel like Im in the cool club I will be letting the friends know about it too Was ready to upgrade my old Galaxy S4 In a family where EVERYONE has an iPhone they all tried talking me into getting an iPhone It didnt work the last time and the Galaxy won out again This time I went with the EdgeI am so loving it I loved my old phone and didnt want to change from the Android format or features of the Galaxy This new phone blows me away with everything once I got used to it The picture formed in the lens of the camera looks better than what it is looking athow does that happen Dump the iPhone and get a Galaxyyou wont be disappointed It is truly out of this world or I should say Galaxy Great upgrade love the expandable memory size is perfect camera is amazing easy to use etc The list goes on The S7 Edge is a great phone easy to use and with great speed and performance The only issue so far is the finger print sensor does not always work properly The last phone I had was the galaxy s5 The features compared to my old phone are great Ive heard negative things about the S6 specifically the fact that it didnt have additional storage I have lots of documents pictures video and music so its great that Samsung brought the addition storage back The camera is great the display is great and the processing of the phone is amazing I have had no problems with this phone since Ive gotten it in the mail Im a very happy with my purchase of the samsung galaxy S7 From the galaxy s6 edge to S7 Faster prettier great phone all around This phone is excellent The features are great I especially love the camera options It takes great pictures And you certainly cant beat the waterproof factor Im happy I made the switch from iPhone to this Have had all of the Galaxy phones except for maybe 2 of them Was a little concerned about the S7 edge not having a removable battery but after about 2 weeks of using it I dont think Ill have an issue The look of the device as well as the screen are great Always loved my galaxies this one seems to be even better Having upgraded from the S5 Im quite happy with the changes Its minor differences that I wish were still available but overall I do not regret the change Every day I learn something new which makes the experience that much greater I cannot wait to pair with my Galaxy S2 thats on order HappyS7User The phones features and performance are unmatched and are fantastic It also works well with my gear VR headset The one major issue this phone has is the design It is a terrible idea to put a glass back on a phone This doubles the area it can crack Just wish there was a protective glass to fit as opposed to the bulky Otterbein but otherwise very pleased Best phone I had in yearsBest phone I had in yearsBest phone I had in yearsBest phone I had in years This phone Is the best in the Galaxy Lineup All the way from the Galaxy S5 To Now the S7 The phone is smooth in the hand Plus the Great Feature of Always On Display The Phone is Wrapped near the bezels to side are nice shape finish giving it that feeling like you have grip on that phone 

The camera indentation has also went down since last years model of the Galaxy S6 Plus the Heartbeat Sensor and Flash have also moved They were on the bottom they are now at the Side of the camera I have not dropped this phone yet So i cant count out Durability yet 

The Con i only have is is that the phone is too slippery Some of the times when i have it in my work pants it can sometimes come out very easily The other con is that i wish they would have brought back the IR Blaster for TVs That would have been great for my TV receiver And TV

Otherwise This is a Recommended Phone to anyone who is interested in the galaxy line up This is a Well Built Phone Replaced my 3 year old S4 and found that some of the features and apps have been scaled back also found that in locations that I had 3G and spotty coverage on my S4 are even worse on my S7 with many dropped calls I never dropped calls in the exact same locations with the S4 It would appear as if they cut back on reception strength hoping the cell service providers would increase coverage and signal strength for them This is a good phone Was a great upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S5 The screen is incredible and the camera is great Nothing negative to say about this phone I absolutely love the galaxy s7 edge Best phone ever made by far Cant get enough of this phone Love all the features and the little tricks are so cool Im blown away Fast processing with excellent battery life The best phone Ive ever owned Works great with Straight Talk service too Great phone speed is great Need to correct issue with dreaming music Best so far Good design and very quick Better looking than iPhone I switched from a Note 4 to the S7 once they announced they were bringing back the sd slot So far I love this phone Cant wait to get my hands on the VR and the Gear 360 I am really impressed with the new phone Battery life is better Still lags a little sometimes Overall it is definitely the best Ive used Love this phone  even it can not outbid my iPhone 6s plus in gaming performance I still think its the best phone out there The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone to take with you on the road for many outdoor adventures 

After purchasing a screen protector and case it was off to the National Parks The built in compass was a big help during my travels and the phones built in SD Card Holder is an added plus to store many great pictures from the road

The Camera is an extremely important quality when selecting a phone and this models camera does not disappoint I was able to capture some great landscape shots with the camera that were keepsakes 

The Hidden Gem in accessories that I recently came across was the wireless charging pod that can be purchased separately No More Plugging in your phone when it can sit on the charging pod for a quick charge It does so much and its so intuitive Ive never felt like a phone was an extension of my personal flow until now It took about a day to get used to the edge and how I hold the phone Its not the fault of the phone though Im so used to having to contort my hand to hold a phone it took me a little while to realize I just need to hold it naturally Love the design and function Batter and screen are best fr me I cannot say enough about the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It combines form and function seamlessly Everything operates fluidly and without stutter The camera is top notch  and bests anything offered up by the competition Add in the water resistance and the beautiful design and this one is an award winner I strayed away from Samsung when they got rid of removable storage but decided to give them another chance when they brought it back And I am so glad that I did The battery life alone is worth purchasing this phone My S5 would last for half a day with normal use and my S7 Edge lasts all day and into the night with the same amount of usage I have not been disappointed yet Battery life is insanely good Build quality is great Waterproof is like adding the icing on top Camera is soooo good that autofocus

Only con that Id have is that its very slippery and of course all of the bloatware Best phone Ive ever owned I have owned galaxy phones since the galaxy s3 Beats my Note 5 and S6 Edge plus Great battery life I have had this phone now for about 11 days and let me tell you it is one of the best Galaxy phones made to this date The new camera features and quality are amazing I love the 200 gig expandable storage The Edge features are amazing with tons of edge panels to choose from Coming from the Galaxy Note 4 this is a major major step up Cant wait to see what the Galaxy Note 6 is like I am extremely happy with this purchase I have been waiting to upgrade my S5 for a while and as hard as it was I bypassed the S6 The performance looks and build quality of this phone is way beyond any phone I have ever purchased before Best camera ever and very fast I love it not to big Coming from an iPhone 5s and being a long time iphone user it took me a bit to make the change I definitely was not sure what to expect but luckily took part in the Samsung Galaxy trial program a few months back The device I trialed was the Galaxy S6 Edge  which I absolutely loved but decided to wait since the S7 was coming so soon I can now say after a few days with the phone I love it many of the small complaints I had around the last phone are gone from a terrific battery life to speedy performance I have no complaints on this phone I had the Note3 and was fully intent on purchasing a Note5 I did not want a smaller phone But after seeing the phone in use my boss purchased one last week I went to the store to get my Note5 but I could not take my eyes off the S7 soon I started playing with it and before I knew I purchased the S7 it has so many features but the biggest was the quality of the screen the additional SDcard slot and the camera I was so impressed with the camera and the many different features that I could not pass on this incredible phone Today my bosses boss is also going to purchase the S7 love this phone I have had this phone for less than a week now and still have not had a chance to find out all of the cool new things it can do But already I LOVE this phone Everyday I learn something new It is fun new and exciting Very customizable and the fast charging is AWESOME I got my new S7 Edge about two weeks ago in early March 2016 I previously had an S5 so waited for the waterproof version with an SD card and better battery life hence my rationale for skipping the S6 So far I really like the S7 Edge  I added a 64MB SD card which has been great I have not tried loading applications to the SD card yet but understand that can be done if the app will support it I really like the waterproof feature without requiring the little flap the S5 had over the microUSB power connection I also like the wireless power charging and rapid charging features  both of which were not present on my S5 In addition Ive had very good luck with the camera on the S7 so far The battery life is much improved over my S5 in that I can get through a day now without requiring charging for the most part I could not do that with my S5 The Marshmellow OS and core apps have performed perfectly so far  I was having issues on my S5 so Im also happy with this change This phone is amazing looks and feels great The screen is bright and colorful Worlds great with one handed operation its a perfect size Great features ot compliments 60 perfectly The phone does get hot when downloading multiple apps or doing heavy multitasking Other then that its a must pick up This phone is a lot faster and smoother Very sleek not to slippery Enjoy the ease of the camera Love my new phone Getting used to the edge but very user friendly The phone is fast easy to set up and does a good job Im happy with it I got one for my 77 year old Mom and its her favorite phone I have been a long time user of Samsung products and finally they brought in the phone that has it all One thing I like most about Samsung phones is they keep me satisfied for years by being cutting edge and not causing me to feel I need to upgrade every 6 months Android Marshmallow is just excellent it feels like butter I love how the operating system works and TouchWiz integrated into it so seamlessly I actually am keeping it as my launch page Samsung Pay is an amazing edition and I cant wait to use it The camera is excellent front and back and is a great improvement The phone is IP68 again like my beloved S5 was and they also brought back the SD card slot  excellent It saves me money because having to pay for more internal storage is a lot more expensive than getting a high capacity top of the line SD card One thing I love about this phone is it is fairly similar to the iPhone in appearance and function but its still android and its still Samsung and it is the best phone Ive ever owned I upgraded from an s4 so this phone is amazing for me The display is amazingly bright and beautiful I enjoyed seeing my battery life on screen and it comes automatically on this device The fingerprint feature is a nice touch to have lol I also like that they added themes for the phone it gives my it more character which I love I wished they would do that for the stock messaging app though All in all the battery lasts forever even with heavy usage The fast charging is a wonderful to have as well as the upgradeable SD card The only cons i would have is not having a removable back Then left side button being the split screen button Just seems like the could have implimented it someother way Pros Battery life is certainly better than previous phones sleek nice size nice design display is great Camera is awesome Its exactly what I expected from Samsung

Cons not manyjust small things You cant customize your text bubbles anymore and the keyboard can be a bit finicky Gentle taps work most of the time but every once in a while you have to use a little more pressure to get the keys near the edge to register

With that said I fully expect updates to roll out that will fix these small things Its a new phone altogether with all of the loved features from previous phones Kudos to Samsung for yet again staying ahead of the phone design game I love the camera It takes amazing photos with realistic colors and clarity The GS7 looks great feels great and functions exceptionally The only glitch is that sometimes it will put you in split screen mode if your fingerhand is hovering or touching the left button screens Other than that best phone on the market The phone has great speed on most everything it does Its great to have the expandable memory back and the dust and water proof rating on the phone But I miss some features that I had on my S5 I miss the air view and child lock app However the gain in charging speed camera abilities sound quality and a few other things the S7 was worth waiting for compared to the S6 So Samsung has been my goto phone since the S2 That being said i have tried other devices being a techie and working in the tech field ITS Ive tried all sorts of devices fixed many devices Samsung seems to have the hardiest hardware on the market IMO 

S7  cool features are the memory card slot coming back not reinventing the wheel here but its nice to have it back  Waterproofing  thats just intelligent design How many people use their phone at coffee shops diner tables near liquidsfood or bathroom  The speed of the phone is amazing it has power Running the phone in the Gear VR you notice basically no latency at all games just flow which is nice Not a gamer not a problem web browsing is fast opening files super fast  Taking pictures you can capture those moments just before you normally would get the camera out and focused because of the speed of which it focuses  By far the greatest smartphone Ive had It has all the features and style that i am looking for in a smartphone I upgraded from a Note 3 to the s7 The selling point was the awesome camera and expandable memory However the lack of removed battery is problematic The phone gets really hot if you use it while charging The battery life does not last but a few hours if I am using the phone 
The phone itself is very slippery and difficult to hang on to without a case Yet if i want to use the vr headset i have to keep removing the case in order for it to work 
The sound cuts out when using headphones 
I miss my Note 3 for the size and tablet feel Able to use the phone with one hand Colors on the screen is vivid Sound is much better than the S5 because of the placement of the speaker The new s7 edge is a very high quality product with many features Exceptional reception and durability Replaced my note 4 with this and Im loving it such snappy nice phone This product is easy to navigate through Picture quality is great Sound is great and techonolgy is ahead of its time Samsung got it right this time with the Galaxy S7 Edge I love the 55 screen They made a large screen without making a huge phone It is so clear and crisp Great for watching videos I love that they brought back the micro SD card slot Now I have plenty of room for my music and videos Waterproof and dust proof what more could you ask for The phone runs very smooth and fast Really like the Marshmallow operating system on it also Great improvement on battery life too Great phone overall I was an iphone user before and now switch to the s7 its far superior on all specs One of the best phones I have ever owned
Love this phone This phone is really an awesome phone its faster than the older version and the battery doesnt drain so fast its really gorgeous I love it The display is awesome the vr is awesome as well my dad mom and my wife didnt wanna take it off the phone all around is great I love it Happy with this upgrade Glad the s7 has brought back the sd card Not really sure about having a glass back Had the phone for less than two weeks It is worth every penny US Cellular is the best carrier by far Check them out than get this phone Find out for yourself Will continue to get the next Galaxy phones as they are released I havent had the phone too long but for the little time Ive had it all I can say is wowzers The design is killer and I truly bought it for the waterproofing Great all around device today I am proud to own Great phone switched from the S5 so much faster  display is best in market I have got to say this phone is the best Samsung has came up with the performance as well as the 4k camera on it is so detailed and clear hands down best pictures and the water proof capability is so epic that I would like to try it out but way to scared to do it but all in all great phone recommend this phone 110 awsome job Samsung keep up the great work This phone has a great camera and wonderful clarity I love the different qualities of the phone and so many cool features on the Samsung S7 I love the sleek design of the phone the camera performance and the beautiful silver titanium color This has been the coolest phone Ive ever had I enjoy all the features Its a lot smoother and faster than the galaxy s6 You can see it from the time you turn it on When you go from one app to another it takes less time to do it I love the new camera even it is only 12 mega pixel It takes real nice picture even at night you see more of the night picture than you did Im very happy for the sd slot is back Good screen quality love the camera wide and easy to grip I absolutely love the S7 The battery life is amazing and the camera is flawless Aside from the Galaxy s7edge being a very stunning device the speed of the phone is stellar  The screen and curve is absolutely brilliant The camera on this phone is by far Amazing  I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and I have managed to make several iPhone users jealous I now have a phone that fits perfectly in my pocket and in my life  This phone is great The battery life performance screen resolution camera everything is awesome Ive been wanting to upgrade my smart watch also and finally took advantage that I had an S7 edge to get a Gear S2 Both are amazing Love that they brought back the SD card Its a beautiful phone A few complaintsno ir blaster no infinite scroll on home screen slow to download apps and Internet cell reception not great 
I had the S5 if this was like that id love the phone I have ownedone answer S3 S4 S6 and now the S7 the S7 is definitely the best android on the market right now Love having my SD card back The screen and battery are amazing Wish could get removable battery and remote control features back And at some point would like to see stereo speakers on the front and normal ear buds instead of those iphone type bad buds But over all impressed with it Love this phone better then I expected Always have had Samsung phones I love this phone and the many options to customize its features eg the Samsung edges I am amazed by the Virtual Reality capabilities It is so much fun Ive had galaxy s3 s6 and now i got the s7 and i must say its the best one ive seenthe design is amazingscreen resolution ultra hdthe phone is very light and its fast like a bullet Very nice phone Wasnt sure about the color at preorder but the gold is really surprisingly awesome In my home we have 5 phones and users  2 iPhones and 3 Samsung all with devoted users whove had several generations of the phone My daughter is using a S6 from an S4 and I am using this S7 from an S3 My S3 was a great phone which lasted 4 years but it was feeling a bit aged The S7 even feels like an upgrade when you hold it The form factor is really nice I have smaller hands and find it fits quite nicely in my hand despite being larger than what I had before My favorite part of the form feature is the bubble like style of the screen Im not sure why I like this so much but it just looks more like a high end phone because of it

Upgrading from an S3 Ive noticed a few other things  the zippy interface and brilliant colors of the screen are such a huge upgrade its amazing I use my phone daily to watch movies and its amazing how the same movie file looks better I also game a lot and I really enjoy the responsiveness there The sound improvement isnt to be sneezed at either The VR is a lot of fun as well but Ive only played with that for a few hours Still need to explore

The biggest upgrade The battery life Samsung finally has a battery life worth talking about Remember how battery life used to be measured in days This phone can do that Ive been testing the power saving modes and I can get almost 2 days of moderate use out of it Im wondering what I can get with ultra power saving Even with normal use in normal mode it handily lasts a day Right now my phone has 69 left It was last charged 20 hours ago and since then has been used moderately for 10 hours including 2 hours as a gps 

My friend at work has the S7 edge and were exploring the phones together I like his edge features but worried about my clumsiness It looks amazing though Really happy about this phone Ive had all of the Galaxy phones except for the S6 and this by far is the best I cant wait to see what the Galaxy line has in store for future models The phone is just simply beautiful and I love using it I have had the note 3 and the note 4 and kinda got tired of the big phone thing So decide to down size and I must say this S7 is one sweet phone

Its quick has a great camera and i like how it fits in my hand as well
So far I am loving the new Marshmallow operating system and the fact it is waterproof is a plus too

I am very pleased so far about the S7 the only thing that i dont like is the fact the battery cannot be taken out other than thatSWEET phone This phone has the most amazing camera Ive ever seen on any smartphone Even in low light conditions the pictures turn out great Id recommend it to anyone I have been with Galaxy since the original Galaxy S and only skipped the S2 for the S3 and then from S4 to S6 but when I seen even the leaks of this phone I knew I wanted itEverything you would want in a phone wrapped up in a GalaxyIdont think you can get any better than this at the momentAnd when the S8 rolls out Ill be waiting I went from the S5 to the S7 The S7 has been even better than the S5 I wish the battery life was a little longer or could be removable Other than that its perfect Great screen and lightning fast Purchased the phone with a bundle including the Gear VR
I have been a Samsung user for a long time Always went with the Note until the S7 Edge In addition a Samsung Gear S smart watch Samsung smart TV the Gear VR and Samsung Note3

So for the S7 it does everything it touts First day got things loaded and ran first test Streamed a movie via Netflix as well as from local media raid On both cases I also was playing a music track and of course ran the Gear VR
I did not notice a flicker of interruption The processor is the best yet in the Samsung phones
The entire phone setup is amazing copying entire contents of Phone and SD card was easy Of course the previous phone was a Samsung 
The monitor on this phone is in my opinion second to none Bright clear great setting features among other options
The side edges are great and even though the functionality is limited I would anticipate that the groundwork is in place where software upgrades would ad greater capacity
 You may say I am bias being a Samsung user for a while and that would be a fair assessment So with that said check the phone out yourself And if you dont agree I will be the one surprised

Great job Samsung Keep it up Great product would buy two or more if I had a chance I absolutely love this phone no complaints at all Defiantly recommend it to anyone  THE GOOD Polished glassbacked design Awesome camera Decent battery life Reintegrated microSD storage slot and IP68 waterresistant rating Easier to hold on to than S6 Speaker is nice and loud when needed

THE BAD Annoyingly reflective Smudge magnet Nonremovable battery which isnt surprising but is still a compromise compared to 2014s S5 Launcher is better but still lacks additional custom settings Bloatware continues but has been reduced

THE BOTTOM LINE The fast powerful beautiful Galaxy S7 phone is 2016s allaround phone to beat If they had a removable battery it would not be beatable I love everything about this phone except that the enyxos version has better battery life audio and no issues with slo mo video Watter proofness is awesome and it is quick Wireless charging is awesome too Best phone ive ever had I do think Samsung hit a Homer with this device so far i have no complaints or issues with it the only thing i would have considered is to give the option to the user regarding adoptable storage I love my new phone it runs very smooth and the vr head set is about the most awesome thing I have ever seen This product has great features
1 Edge
2 SD card
3 Battery Life
4 Photos and Videos Quality and more This is an upgrade from an S3 so of course its going to be better but it has filled all my expectations Its fast looks great feels great Its all there My only wish is that it would have less preinstalled apps or the ones that were installed could be truly uninstalled instead of just disabled

other than that one minor complaint im so happy I upgraded Very few phones nowadays are the full package Samsung did a great thing with the gs7 by checking all the important boxes Battery camera performance screen fingerprint scanner water resistance You cant go wrong with this phone Love my new galaxy s7 edge Loving the expandable memory Such an upgrade from the s6 This is coming from someone whos had galaxy phones since the start Just got the phone and it broke in less than a week 

My camera lense shattered while the phone was in my pocket My best guess is that the pressure from something else in my packet made it shatter 

Now I have to send it in to be fixed and get a replacement phone while it is being fixed This phone is so awesome and sleek Not to mention the size and the speed love this phone Would never purchase any other brand of phone I preordered my Galaxy S7 Edge and I received it on March 7 four days before the worldwide launch date I was eagerly waiting for the phone so it was such a great thing to receive it early Its been two weeks since I received my phone and I must say it is such an amazing phone Its extremely fast the camera is great and it is a very beautiful phone One of my relatives even switched to Samsung after she used my phone and realized what a great phone it is Also thank you Samsung for bring back the SD Card slot That is one of the biggest reason why I love Samsung phones so much This new phone has great features wonderful new camera with some features that are on my Canon 70D SLR camera The screen has super resolution The edge has many new ways to keep in touch with the world around you I would recommend this unit to anyone who is wanting a new smart phone I would have preferred a 64G phone but living with 32G Wish there was a way to put applications on the SD card Cell service and WIFI signal not as strong as S5 A on removable storage The look of the new S7 is very nice It fits very well in your hand I am upgrading from an S4 so there are a lot of new features that I really enjoy I however wish that they had come out with more colors of the phone I just bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and I must say I am quite impressed Much added new features and a camera that has been upgraded Phone takes great pictures works fast fits great on my palm it is very light screen has great screen colors and looks good I wasnt sure at first but I really like this phone Im not electronically inclined so Im still learning how to use the new features Love the screen and water resistant features the most The rest will come in time I rated the price as average only because that is what most phones cost and I feel they are all well over priced Definitely would recommend this phone in fact my daughter went out and bought one the day after she looked at mine It has been a hit with everyone that has seen it so far Being an advid user of samsung products switching over about 4 years ago or so from IOS operating system samsung continues to deliver within their mobile development division My first venture within their mobile division was with the galaxy s4 great operating system camera and loved the ability to customize my device via launchers Just before the launch of the s6 i compared the galaxy s5 to the latest flagship glaxay 6 and seemed very impressed with the difference The external sd expansion as well as the replacement battery option on the s5 and not the s6 made my buying decision I missed the s6 withthe updated camera but with the s5 and its capabilities i was very happy 

Now with the anticipated release of the s7 after doing my homework i knew this would be my next phone After having the s5 for a little over a year it offered some similarities to the new s7 excluding the battery replacement Im very happy with the interfacespeed camera look and feel of this new flagship release I ended up giving my daughter my extra s5 battery now that this s7 has the quick charge option as well as the purchase of the charging pad 

Looking forward to newly released accessories for it new VR launches and more updates

Thank you samsung You hit it with this one Fast functional responsive videos look amazing sound is superb Good deal  amazing products good performance great prices elegant design This phone isn ot only aesthetically pleasing but also just so hi tech I love the sleek design and the tininess of it Also droid always as ever comes in handy over iphone when i need to go online while makeing a phone call love this phoen I love my S7 it has many features that other phones do not have i love that it have micro SD again and the camera is awesome Thank you thank you for bringing back the SD card slot back Its the number one reason why I love Samsung over apple besides the excellent phone of course and its features I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 and I can say that this product has impressed me It is built well water resistant and is super fast when using apps I couldnt be more pleased with my s7 edge Great upgrade from my s5 Best phone I have ever owned I love the VR apps as well Wish some of the apps were cheaper and the phone didnt have to cool down so often but it is a lot of fun this is the best cellphone i had in the last couple of years There are many advanced features in Galaxy S7 Edge compare to previous products The best feature is extendable memory slot which I really love it
I would totally recommend this product Love the video call  love the gold color easy to use love the home button the camera and how fast it charges Would definitely recommend this phone Support is great if you need it Friends and family love it I love everything about it Would definitely buy it again super phone Easily the best phone created yet Samsung continues to make the best products VR with this phone is a must see Wish the back of the phone was not glass slippery otherwise its perfect I really do love my phone but I dislike the glass I cant find a case to protect my phone  
I will never go back to a different phone even with the s7 edge being glass Love this phone I switched to Verizon from another carrier and bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 about a month ago So far I love it

Pros Fast Good size vivid colors excellent sound just enough space SD card waterproof can do so many things And I love the new Android Marshmallow interface And the cameras they take such beautiful pictures The selfie camera is great because you can use hand motions to take a picture which means steady not blurry images that always turn out awesome It feels great to hold and looks awesome And the list goes on and on

Cons The battery life is not great even after turning off the always on display But given how awesome everything else is carrying around my charger to plug it in once or twice a day depending on use is not so bad Plus with the charger that comes with the phone it only takes about an hour to fully charge so really its not so bad after all I am EXTREMELY satisfied with the camera part of the phone The camera is better than the competitors  hands down I have had just about every smartphone down the line from the original iPhone etc I was most recently using the Galaxy Note 5 after using the S6 Edge for a few months both of which were excellent phones I can honestly say this S7 Edge is the prettiest fastest sleekest phone I have ever used The interface is very responsive and this iteration of TouchWiz is definitely lighter while maintaining many handy features The camera while taking a megapixel drop to 12 MP produces by far the best photos I have seen off a smartphone as well pictures are detailed sharp beautifully contrasted with a gorgeous bokeh effect courtesy of the F17 aperture The larger pixels along with the wider aperture also make for not only very usable but often stunning low light shots All in all a big win for Samsung and very highly recommended If youre into customization like me this is the phone for you Performance wise is great its fast and fun to use Ive had no issues with my phone so far This phone does everything I expect it to do and it does it well What makes it a great phone is where it exceeds my expectations 

The Galaxy S7 is another great Samsung product its features are great and its just awsome love the motion sensor and its very durable fast charging I had a Samsung galaxy3 I loved and had it so long it died I have always liked the android Samsung products Then I had to got to a borrowed galaxy note 2 it was a Lil to big for me I got the new Samsung Galaxy 7 and was so freaking excited I couldnt wait This phone has to much for me to learn I feel I am missing out Love the size and clarity Its clear that Samsung has taken customer feedback and criticisms to heart by taking what worked with previous phones and refining them The improvements of this phone definitely justify the upgrade from my Note 5 

The battery life has been amazing so fat easily going about a day and a half before needing to charge I hope Samsung continues with the trend of adding a little bulk to their phones to make room for larger batteries 

Samsung Pay is a great feature to have and I hope Samsung continues to improve and expand the service

This phone is also absolutely beautiful

My only complaints would be that its a fingerprint magnet and the carrier bloatware that comes preinstalled Samsung carries enough weight that they should be able to fight carriers on that So I upgraded from the 6 edge to the 7 edge and hands down love it The fact that it is water resistant is wonderful My 7 edge doesnt heat up like my 6 did when watching movies or playing games The side menus I love that theyve expanded the selections Another thing I like is the 55 screen size makes it feel perfect in my hand Picture taking is awesome Works great with Samsung pay I am very disappointed in this phone The phone has many great features and works well However it cannot be used for development For most people this would not be a problem For me it is a great disappointment and I may very well return this phone and buy an N phone Additionally there is not a glass protector that fits the edge perfectly I have a week with the phone this phones is super nice
1 Design very cool and feel very comfortable in the hands and is very attractive 
2 Battery life the battery is good but if you will play and watch movie make sure you have a bank with you if you are doing outside
3 Edge Personally is unusable for me but that give a special look to the phone
4 Cameras I just can say is pure quality in photography mode video is ok

Things I dont like
Battery life is not too long how I spect After watching a movies 130 hrs I need to recharger the device I have a cheaper phone with same life time

Edge not have function that you really need or add things that could be functional

Rear side please remove the Cristal and give me metal that add extra life to the device Solid decide and love that the memory card slot was added back to the device So far there has been no issue with lag and the camera is phenomenal I was skeptical of the s7 edge after reading reviews about the s6 edge After having it for a day I thought it was amazing Samsung makes great products that last I purchased mine a week ago It is a quality product though it does come with a steep price It is beautiful to look at and easy to use What more do you want Waterproof Check Just ditched my iPhone and Im glad I did I have had every Samsung S phone since they began Just when i think they cant get any better Samsung always proves me wrong The price is on the high side but i love how they try and make up by throwing in freebies like the VR and 64gb sim cards also free wireless chargers if you activate Samsung Pay with credit card What I love the most about my phone is the picture quality and the fact i can use a 200gb sd card They bought back the sd card and the waterproof features which means that they actually listen to their customers We wanted this back and they gave it to us and then some I have nothing but good things to say about my new Galaxy S7 truly the best phone I have ever owned but trying to register this product was a problem There was something wrong with my IMEI  which took over a week to get registered online Other than that I love the phone and I cant wait for my VR gear claim to be accepted and get here so I can play with it I got the phone on March 7 2016 this comes with Snapdragon 820 processor whereas the non US region comes with Exynos processor I am based in US While I like the phone in terms of its built design camera various unique features like always on edge feeds and apps samsung pay there are many areas where Samsung still needs to catch up

Areas of improvement cons
1 Apparently snapdragon phones are experiencing a high battery drain due to Andorid OS I have seen it in many forums about the same complaints users are having However the Exynos processor phones are not having the same high battery drain With the 3600mAH battery you would expect the phone to last around 89 screen on time whereas mine only does about 5 hours
2 Samsung has improved on their laggy TouchWiz but it is still not upto the par and needs fair bit of enhancement
3 Bootloader is locked which limit the options to the users to root install custom ROMs This is not the same case for the Exynos processor phones on S7 Not sure why Samsung has taken differentbiased approach for the masses irrespective of where one is located they should be given the same benefits 

When you are buying investing in such a expensive device you would expect everything to be perfect Hopefully Samsung realize these issues and fix it soon in their updated firmware

Thanks Vineet I have to say this Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a great phone Its super fast and makes a 2 minute function into 30 seconds Also Im liking the function of Do not disturb and Samsung Pay Each are easy to use in come in handy all the time Also a lot of fun to use with the Samsung Gear Much improved from the s6 edge I love the casing its much faster and less glitches as the other Expandable memory is much better too I love the Galaxy s7 edge I had an s6 edge and found the extra features added for the s7 edge were very useful I use the edge screen everyday to access apps I use all the time but dont want to clutter my home screen with and to make calls I wish they made this in a 51 screen still Have been using Samsung Galaxy line for quite sometime and this is the best phone since Galaxy S3 introduction the rest was incremental updates I recently upgraded from the S6 to the S7 and I have to say Im not all that impressed Now dont get me wrong it is a nice phone overall but coming from the S6 there really doesnt seem to be any speed or performance increase The battery as well for being bigger lasts about the same as the S6 and that is in power save mode and the always on screen shut off The 2 added features of being waterproof and having an SD card are of no real value to me If I were looking for a phone Id just get the S6 since it should surely cost less now that the S7 is out This is my 3rd galaxy and I love the S7 edge just as much as my first one The battery is great it runs well I couldnt be happier My only issue is the autocorrect Its better then the last ones but theres still a lot of room for improvement comin from s6 edge beats the phone in every way camera is better in low light shots and every day use waterproof is also a big plus

ability to turn notifications off while i play games is also awesome also the glass screen and back are pretty much scratchproof compared to s6 edge Bringing back the microsd card slot and waterproof was best thing Have been using samsung since Galaxy s3 Best galaxy device yet Best camera on a phone till date is a super phone 

i love the way that pic takes its increible  100 times better than my Note 4 Sleek and powerful Will recommend to everyone  I love everything about this phone Although it would be cool if it was way more waterproof So far i love this phone The battery life is awesome takes great pictures quick downloads Very easy to use This is my third Galaxy S phone and somehow Samsung just keeps outdoing themselves The phone has great features and has been very easy to use and navigate over the three days Ive had it One very nice and new feature is the new dongle that comes in the box The associate at the store where I purchased the phone connected the S7 Edge to my old S5 via this device and it transferred all of my photos contacts and apps right over in the amount of time it took him to do all of the paperwork etc to complete my upgrade It was nice not needing to go home and redownload all of my apps A simple log in and sync with Gmail and my calendar was updated and it was as if I never changed phones Im still finding out new things with each passing day and have a feeling that my experience will only get better I enjoyed using my Samsung Galaxy S5 for about 15 years and the new Galaxy S7 is a great update Advanced features give you more control over the information and app can access Love my phone Very easy to see text apps actions without enlarging in normal viewing size Very fast responses and fast internet weather on wifi or 4G Fits hand very well Beautiful color sophisticated look Waterproof waterproof waterproof Stylish and sleek with bright display I particularly like the new waterproof feature 
 I really like this phone It has all the features I need and more I like its design feel and style It works for me for all my personal and practical needsI used to like the iphone but this is my third samsung And my next one will be also Great phone I especially like the quality of the phones camera This series of Samsung phones is the best so far and will lead next generation I have owned Samsung phones for years I started way back with a Galaxy S2 then went with a S3 on to an S4 then a Note 4 Now I cant say enough about the new Galaxy S7 Edge It does everything you need it to do and MORE I purchased the gold and the black I upgraded from a Note 4 and couldnt decide between the Note 5 and the S7 Edge I debated for some time comparing the specs of each which are pretty comparable and decided that because I barely ever used the SPen on my Note 4 that I would go with the Edge I am glad I did I LOVE IT If you are undecided and debating on whether or not this phone is for you just give it a tryI guarantee you will NOT want to return it back to the storeEVER 

BATTERY LIFE IS AMAZING  Better than ANY Galaxy phone I have owned

SCREEN  bright flawless and a perfect size

WEIGHT  OVERALL SIZE  Not too heavy feels comfortable in your hand Easy to access things with one hand especially with the Edge feature NOTE  you will have to get a case for it I got a clear one so I can still see the nice gold color of the phone because it is slick and it WILL slip out of your hands if you arent careful The case gives it a little more grip

Anyway just go for it  you have some time to decide and return it if you dont like it As I said I highly doubt you will want to return itreally I absolutely love the phone it is amazing I think its a great device Its very fast and the features are way better than the iPhone or Galaxy S6 The only problem I am having with it is the battery drains pretty quick at least on my end and I use my phone moderately I do not play games on my phone but the one game I have runs fine on it The other problem I am having with it is that the internet will constantly disconnect and reconnect  regardless of if I am connected to WIFI or cellular I think its a glitch in the software Samsung may be fixing Other than that its a great phone Battery life is hopeless and all the craziness yu need to do to replace it  for this consumer  forgetaboutit  uroutofhere  This phone is great There are a few things I would have changed The nonremovable battery for one I believe everyone should be able to service their batteries I am sure this is what fivesnit the water resistance but still

The thouch screen is a bit over sensitive And I think they need more edge apps I believe that fonts themes and icons should be allowed to be purchased on the play store not just the Samsung store Perhaps go with a very popular theme engine like cyanogenmodss or Layers

Wish there were more cards allowed to be used in samsng pay

 would recommend this phone to ANYONE looking to purchase new or just upgrade I was shocked the super speedy charging system it comes with from Samsung Unbelievable If you purchase this phone soon 2016 Ive noticed a lot of awesome promotions offered Definitely check with your ISP or Samsung You just cant go wrong with this phone Very satisfied Krissy Absolutely LOVE THIS PHONE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN SAMSUNG This device is gorgeous hands down the prettiest phone Ive ever seen I love it And its working great so far no sudden resets fast response the screen is amazing and the camera is the best one on phones so far I wasnt much of a Samsung person but honestly after getting this phone I have totally changed my mind Im very proud of my purchase If I have to say 1 con would be the builtin speaker position my thumb is always on it This phone is amazing it looks sleek and has so many great features love Samsung pay app Just bought this samsung s7 edge and love everything about it Still learning to use it Demo blew me away in store I couldnt hold back but to buy it It offers so much and is packed with so much Im so amazed I just love the graphics on this phone The phone gets hot if I use it to long and the battery drains to fast other then that I like it a lot Nice features but battery drains very quickly Pricey The S7 has an amazing camera with great resolution Pus other camera features such as slow motion wide selfie virtual shot live broadcast and others Its easy to navigate and personalize Its also water resistant which is good for when you get some food or other crud on it Another thing I really like is the other samsumg apps There pretty easy to use and super helpful for using the gear and samsung pay Overall its a pretty awesome phone and I really like it It has so many features fun to learn quality product Work has a tendency to drain a battery while the phone is trying to location a signal Also most phones do not connect in the building This phone does not use that much battery looking  as it does connect Great connection and great battery Loving my new phone As a 76 yrold senior nerd I found my Galaxy S3 perfectly fine until the S7 announced the return of additional SD memory and with encryption Having information available in a doctors office on a trip or just trying to remember names of relatives   my phones SD chip is my private mobile cloud 
A musthave accessory for me is a case with a stand so I can set it up to read my NYTimes ebook watch video or see a nightclock 
As usual my S7 is getting better and better as I discover new capabilities The edge screen gives me a quick look as my stocks scores and weather And for those who get impatient with we old folks taking so long to use a credit card or take out pennies at a cashier I love my Android Pay which gets me on my way faster And the imagevideo quality  wow I love the HRD feature that balances out the extreme brightdark areasand so much more
Also I still use my S3 around the house to listen to web radio podcasts etc over wifi and earbuds No complaints Samsung has lived up to its name with this upgrade Great features and pretty easy to use I cant wait to try out the free music Having a 55 screen that still fits so well in my pocket is absolutely wonderful It is so bright and crisp The outside of the phone feels elegant sturdy but not too heavy and adding a case that still gives me access to the edge while adding grip really puts this phone over the top The camera takes the best pictures Ive seen on a smartphone Basically everything except the following paragraph is perfect in my experience

 Lack of adoptable storage
 The forced bloatware from carriers Verizon on this phone
 TouchWiz However adding Nova Launcher mitigated many of my complaints about TouchWiz I switched from a I phone and love this phone its fast Upgraded from S5 skipped S6 Love the S7edge Wish it had USB 3 Great and user friendly I like to use it for everything Easy to use Great phone Love the features Sound quality is excellent The salesperson was excellent and transferred all my important files from my S4 My l long awaited upgrade was flawless A beautiful experience from beginning to end not to mention the phone is beyond belief Ive only had it a couple of days now its smarter than me Ill hopefully get it figured out somewhat eventually I hope I love the design of the phone and all the new features that it has This is a nice phone Great fit in your hand Still feels a little uncomfortable getting used to the curved sides but thats really the only thing I can think of I find the phone to be sleek The slight curve to the face is taking me a bit to get used to Big improvement on the camera and some other features Really like the fingerprint security feature I do miss the green camo of the S5 active Still new but so far so good The s7 other than water resistance and expandable memory is a down grade from the S6 Theres no IR blaster a screen that doesnt allow for tempered glass protectors that actually cover the screen you have to download an app to play your personal music collection google mediamusic stinks because you cant just view your music without recommendations and it seems to be in general lacking of preloaded applications that the s6 had Do yourself a favor and get an LG with a more vivid screen or wait to see if samsung shapes up on the next model Dont be suckered in by samsungs free gifts This is the 4th of the galaxy models Ive had I have been a iPhone user for years and I just recently just been breathed taken away with this s7 edge I do miss all the songs and apps I bought on my old iPhone This was a great trade Went from s3mini to this this is great good quality I am the proud owner of a Samsung s7 that I didnt have to purchase because my Samsung 5 is still in perfect working condition I extremely fond of the Samsung products because the brand has proven itself to me time and time again I own 4 Samsung televisions along with my last big purchase of a refrigerator which I purchased November 2015 nit to mention other Samsung productsthat i own previously Keep up the good quality work Eveyone that knows me knows that im a Samsung type of guy Has a great size screen Was skeptical buying a new phone but very glad I did Expandable memory was a huge factor in my decision Loving all the features I love my new phone I had been waiting for 5 years to get another new phone and this is the one I chose because of its durability I am a horse trainer and my phone is outside all day This phone is built to last Its a great phone I love the design of the phone The camera is amazing Its awesome I am looking forward to the new s7 I just traded my s5 in and I am excited to own this new phone Best idea yet with the cord port the change over phones and battery life amazing This phone has the best camera and screen I have ever seen on a electronic device The quality of this product is amazing great phone and sales rep who sold it to me been a CUSTOMER SINCE 1992 The phone is great the only issue i have is that i lose LTE service and goes to 3g a loti came from s5 and i never seen it go to 3gbut overall great phone and looks amazing The S7 is a great phone Ive only owned for a little over a week and was originally going to purchase the iphone 6 So glad i didnt Hopefully i get my Vr soon So far I am very happy with my phone The Galaxy S7 edge is very light  The photos taken with the edge are very vibrant and clear Way to go SAMSUNG
Loaded with great performance I love this phone This phone is very cool Very durable I love the Always On Feature and I love that this phone has video call And the camera is amazing The phone lured me in with the Snapdragon 820 The display model in store looked nice It felt nice in my hand I picked up the S7 Edge which was the same size as my previous phone and decided the original S7 was definitely the one for me

The outside edge of the screen is curved down to the bezel creating an alluring sensation of increased smoothness  because glass clearly has varying levels of smoothness when its fully intact That said the phone itself feels grand in either hand the TouchWiz onehanded mode is also pretty nifty

All in all everything about this phone feels fantastic US Cellular provides minimal bloat with your phone any they include can be disabled I do have a Spigen thincase over the phone as it tends to be a bit slippery with the glass back which also provides that hyper smooth sensation when you caress the rounded areas of the device

And of course I can run like a ton of nonsense at once and it doesnt lag The extra gig of ram over my previous device  the S7 has 4gb ram plus the SD820 really do make this one powerful handset Im really excited for my Gear VR to appear so I can really utilize the chipset

All in all beautiful device physically fantastic hardware powering the device and if you really dont like the TouchWiz UI you can always use NovaLauncher and customize your icons app drawer etc The best part about it I was not a fan of Samsung at all for the past several years but Im completely happy with this device The Samsung S7 has a Ferrell that is comfortable to hold and offers over handed operation The screens glide and I havent experienced any lag at all 

The phone comes packed with great features such as S Health S voice and a great looking display

This phone is worth the wait and the price The features are awesome Great camera also Way more than I expected I love all the new features on the S7 Easy to set up and use This Phone is AWESOME
Works great with me Gear S2
Really amazed with the screen on this thing Beautifully sleek phone design and completely amazing camera New to the platform and after two weeks with the phone I can easily say that this is the best endtoend experience that I have ever had Solid beautiful hardware Stable fast software Great battery life Got my new and it runs great matter of fact it runs faster than my S5 still learning about my phone but I love it Its not just a phone its the GALAXY in your hand great phone does everything that i need it to do plus some love the always on clock and the actually black color of the phone Its my first Samsung phone and I just love it The edgeless design makes the phone an unique product in the market I wish the battery could be even stronger as currently it works just as long as my previous Sony Z2 but that one has been used for more than 2 years already One of the best phones I have ever had Everything on it is great Got my new Galaxy last week and I absolutely love it The camera is so much more advanced and improved than the 5 series Awesome phones best features great hd great space great system update Ive had it for about a week and it has worked wonderfully Very glad I picked it up this is the best phone ever is my first Samsung Phone but always I been waiting for that I just picked the new Galaxy S7 up this week The new features are awesome it is very user friendly
So far i have no complaints about the phone I WENT FROM THE NOTE 4 TO THE GALAXY S7 EDGE THE SIZE IS PERFECT ITS BIG ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO BIG WHICH MEANS ITS COMFORTABLE IN YOUR HAND AND STILL VERY VISIBLE WHILE READING EMAILS OR SURFING THE NET CAMERA IS AMAZING TOO I had my galaxy 5 for almost 2 years and loved it I heard mixed reviews about the 6 so I didnt upgrade Situations beyond my control forced me to buy a new phone and I went with the 7 I love it so far Very similar to my 5 with the features I enjoyed from that phone Im still learning it but so far am very pleased Great battery life and clean crisp display Thin and light I am very happy with this phone I have no complaints at all I would however be extremely happy if there would be an update for kids mode for this phone as there is on the S5 and S6 I really am pleased with the camera on this phone its amazing I have had my phone for 4 days now and love it in all aspects but one  the battery life which was one of the main reasons I selected this phone so I am extremely disappointed At first I thought it needed a full drain and then a charge but Ive done that and still see poor results 6 hours of being unplugged at 100 and used mildly while at work resulted in 46 battery life That is exactly what I was seeing with my two year old Droid ultra that was known for notoriously poor battery life 
Otherwise it is a beautiful responsive impressive phone Have not taken any photos yet but viewed the camera and the image on screen looked nice I read the complaints about bloat ware before I purchased but was pleasantly surprised to find it wasnt anywhere near as bad as I was expecting  only a handful of programs that I didnt have on my old phone and that I needed to uninstall 

If it werent for the battery life this would be a perfect phone As it is was torn between recommending and not I have no words to describe how wonderful this phone is All features are fantastic Its design is perfect there is nothing to ask more I love it I have owned all Galaxys since they came outi still have the original one and the S4 I went from the S4 to the S6 and was disappointed I was so happy to upgrade a week ago to the S7 I and super impressed Not only is it fast it is very user friendly I love the 4 but the 7 is a great phone to upgrade to Dont bother with the 6 Im my short time having itlike 4 months i had battery failure was slow and just all around a bad phone Get the 7 Its so worth it I bought the Samsung S7 for my son just a week ago and he babies his phone According to all the videos on this phone it can withstand knives and such Well that is SO NOT TRUE He already has 4 small scratches on this phones screen and on the back of phone The screen protectors on Verizon and Amazon get horrible reviews I will say the performance is great and the screen is vibrant and beautiful Its easy to navigate around But my son is upset about that scratches and is worried about carrying it around in his pocket until we can get some better protection for it I cant give this a GREAT review because of all the advertising of how indestructible and tough this phones screen is Its a lie However I will recommend this product due to the software and all the things it can do Just hold on to the phone carefully  So far I love this phone I upgraded from the S4 mini and Im so glad I did The camera is absolutely amazing Ive had no problem with the battery life Ive only had to charge at the end of the day so far Gave the design a 4 because I know the battery isnt going to last forever so without a removable battery once the battery dies a new phone will have to be bought I only buy a new phone every two years or may even wait longer This phone has a beautiful design to it The camera is amazing to it aswell Very happy with this phone It is much nicer than my last Samsung the play store app does not work on wifi I traded it in and got a second phone and I am here dealing with the same problem I was looking online for a solution and thought to myself that I should not have to be fixing a new phone that I am paying big bucks for First of all this phone feels great in the hand It is so smooth The performance is out of this world Im totally in love Ive had Samsung phones since the original Galaxy  I have been getting the Samsung phones since cell phones were introduced This SG 7 is by far the best one yet I went from the SG 5 to the SG 7 since the SG6 was missing some features that I had grown to love with my SG5 I am very happy with the new SG7 It is very much like the SG5 but will more features and better pictures Thank you The S7 edge is a work of art The worst part about the device is the lack of tempered glass screen protectors which has nothing to do with Samsung I also dont care for the sd card in the same part as the sim The phone is well sized and packed with features Its a direct competition to the current iPhone and dethrones it in every category The camera is amazing the hi def screen is second to none the bigger battery gives me a solid days worth of use the snap dragon 820 allows for the phone to operate flawlessly and to top it off its water resistant I cant speak on durability but if its anything like my previous samsung this phone will be the whole package As an artist this product is undeniably a masterpiece The beautiful juxtaposition between its organic exterior design and its electricalmechanical precision is flawless The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has gone out of its way to evolve itself and yet preserve the essence of its unique brand design and telephonic features

This phone does not alienate the user but veritable brings him or her sheer pride and reliability knowing that they own a pocketsized masterpieceDJ Wow Best phone ever So fast and easy to use so many options and the camera is amazing Thank you Samsung I am completely impressed in the smooth functioning of the new S7 It seems to respond very quickly and so far has held wonderful battery life I pretty much run my full business through my phone and this has made a great addition to the company I do have to say that I skipped the S6 because of the fact it no expansion slot for my microsd card I am astounded that the S7 has the ability to handle the new high speed cards up to 128 GB Totally worth the purchase I have been an iPhone user for many many years but after my fiance got the Samsung s6 and I saw how amazing and functional it was I decided to jump ship to a more advanced well rounded device And then Samsung announced s7 and all features especially the expandable memory water resistant construction great ui and particularly higher capacity battery there was no reason to think twice before I placed the order as soon as the pre ordering was open and now with the phone in hand I am so glad and I was proud to recommend and show off all cool features that this has to my friends and make them envy this jewel Thank you Samsung for this wonderful phone After being a tried and true Galaxy Note user and studying this S7 edge before its release I decided I must try it Of course if the next Note comes out and is a light year ahead of the S7 edge well I will go back to the note series but to be honest the S7 edge is a true upgrade from the Galaxy Note 5 and I believe is well worth the time effort and money to invest into for a new handset I run multiple businesses and play a lot of high demanding games and apps This phone flawlessly runs them all Not to mention the over 30 accounts synced to the device The note 5 could handle the environment but definitely had a few skips in the beat 

So far very happy and excited with this purchase I also love the feel of the phone and over all design It is becoming so High end feeling that not only are we light years ahead of apple in product spec preformance but also in asthetics I love how durable how fast it is and how I can transfer all my apps from my old phone to this one theres a lot of new neat stuff that I have to learn but this phone makes it very easy to understand Im very happy with it I finally came out of the stoneage and got my first smartphone Im still playing around on it and learning new things but Im loving it The ease of usethe beautiful pictures it takes and the notifications are great Highly recommend this phone to anyone I love my phone Its fast and beautiful color makes it look like a classy phone Its a little small for my large handsI think a case will take care of that I changed from an iPhone to a Samsung S7 Edge and stepped into a new world The things this phone does for you is amazing The pictures are astonishingly beautiful The music is clear and so nice There are so many free apps compared to the iPhone I am a true Samsung junkie now Ill never switch The look is so beautiful Everyone needs to try it once and they will be hooked Good job So far this is my 2nd samsung and I am already impressed with the phone They last me years and the quality just keeps getting better and better I can not wait to see what the future holds Its sooooo good And I really like it I like it a lot Had mine for less than a week and got rid of it Bluetooth is a hit or miss on what it connects to and when it does it doesnt always work properly The wifi is even worse Would not work I would turn it off and connect with the 4g data then turn wifi back on For instance Pandora would not connect while on wifi If I turned wifi off Pandora would connect Once it did I could turn wifi back on and everything was fine Sometimes Bluetooth would keep the Internet from working Tried in multiple hotspots to make sure it wasnt the hotspot but it made no difference Other then that it was a awesome phone Great picture and fast As being a Samsung fan I went from the S4 which I loved to the S7 The S7 has to many bugs that need to be fixed to be a good phone Beautiful design light weight but quality feeldoesnt feel cheap Has every feature you need plus some you didnt even realize you needed but are happy you have them now Good battery life wireless fast charging beautiful pictures from front and rear camera Stepped away from Samsung for a bit but Im so happy I came backdont think Im going anywhere from now on Ive had this phone for a little over a week now and it works flawlessly Great phone with a lot of features very fast processor and a beautiful display My only problem with it is the battery it dies pretty fast I would have given it all fives if it wasnt for that Hook it up to the fast charger and its back to full power in a hurry overall a great phone Everything works except for the Wifi no IP address love the new galaxy7 awesome phone camera and video sharp photos Fast and powerful nice keyboard like the calendar layout better than on my previous phone Battery doesnt have the reserve I was used to on my other phone It is adequate but needs to be recharged at the end of the day Usually down below 40 and I dont do any streaming On the plus side the quick charge is nice recharges to 100 in about an hour or so The s7 edge is an excellent phone The battery is such an improvement over its predecessor I love it When I use this phone is is pure enjoyment The edge is improved the battery lasts plenty long the camera is crisp and fast and as always the screen is beautiful Most of all this phone is the best looking phone I have seen to date This is great I am so excited to finally have a new age phone Youll love this phone I cant say enough about this phoneit looks great super bright screen with the most vivid colors long life batteryholds a charge longer than the s7 looks feels  works amazing best samsung device everIve purchased many We love Samsung and even more so that they brought back the microsd optionthanks for listening to your customers Samsung S series just keep improving with every new model The S7 is a no brainer This phone is great I love that it is heavier than the s5 I love all the stuff I can do with it I feel the this device has been excellent for me The upgrade from the S5 to the S7 is very noticeable If you have the S6 you might not notice itas easily The performance on this phone is amazing I really love that they decided to bring back the expandable SD slot and water resistant features You can really notice the difference in the camera especially in low light environments Overall I love the device and I would definitely recommend this product Ive only had it one day but so far Im very happy with it the buttons are firm and being water resistant is a plus The speaker sounds great with my music and photos look great Very happy with the purchase I like this phone so far The selection of ringtones the s7 comes with is horrible I guess someone is trying to get you to go out and buy better ones More choices for simple ringtones and notifications would be good for a topoftheline device I saw someone complain in a review that the fingerprint unlock is slow not so on this device it is very quick to unlock and way faster than typing in a pin or password I previously had the Galaxy S3 and had been waiting to upgrade to a phone that was fast had a microsd slot a great display long battery life and a slim form factor Samsung hit a home run with this phone by tying all the pieces together If you have the opportunity then I also highly recommend purchasing the Samsung VR because its unbelievable I will have this phone for a long time I love the fact that the slot for the micro SD card is back Love that its water proof and the feel of it is great Just love my new S7 When downloading updates in the background running applications seem to stutter and lock up occasionally The phone also gets hot with prolonged usage 

In addition the edges are overly sensitive Its difficult to hold and not mistakenly touch the sides potentially pressing something unintended 

Its a beautiful phone though and the features are nice Typing is easy and when youre doing one thing at a time it works smoothly I think the edge issue will be resolved with some sort of case that will give my hand and slight buffer from the glass I upgraded from the Samsung S6 Edge specifically because of WiFi enablement wasnt available due to Lollipop 511 and lack of upgrade to Marshmallow 601 Im totally stoked at the speed camera features and removable SD card The camera did drop from 16 to 12 megapixels but 12 is plenty for me with a better Fstop of 17 versus 19 Also the dualpixel focus is amazing as well Like the idea of the flatcamera versus protruding so it lays really flat Although the Smart Switch utility is a big time saver there were timeout issues with using the USB cable Use WiFi May take a bit longer but moved all my data What improvement in this app I would like to see is to retain all your desktop icons and groups I have to recreate them all This review isnt about the app though Ive been a loyal Samsung owner for years because they build a solid product that outperforms the competition Great phonenever mind appleall my products are samsung Just do it  top of the line Nothing like the edge No words check it out in store This is my first Samsung smart phone and I was a bit hesitant at first However each day my appreciation for this phone has grown Outstanding design and Ive been impressed with how many things sets this phone apart from others I left android phones several years ago but this is the phone that brought me back I like everything about it especially the screen The design of this device is by the far the best of anything in the market Im so glad I decided to get it oh and the expandable memory makes it by far the market frontrunner Ive had the S7 Edge for about a week and so far its been great I love the new edge software features the fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate camera is gorgeous and it looks amazing If you want a stylish quick and functional phone this is the one for you Additionally the size is perfect For a 55 screen its very comfortable to hold 

However be wary You are going to spend a lot of money on this phone and if you have even a MINOR drop the screen is done Just done My phone slipped out of my pocket fell one foot onto a wood floor and now I have to get a replacement through insurance As insult to injury I ordered a case from Samsung but it was put on a currently indefinite backorder Its great when you cant even order a case for the most delicate phone Samsung has ever produced

In summary if you want a great looking quick and cutting edge phone get it if youre careful or have deep pockets If you are even remotely accident prone avoid this at all costs or leave it at home until you get an Otterbox minimum Its just not worth the risk otherwise and Im hoping my backorder case comes in by the time my insurance replacement is issued I mainly decided to get this phone because of the edge And it has not disappointed I find myself falling more in love with the shortcuts every day

This is just a gorgeously designed phoned that feels great in the hand The display is incomparable as well as the camera

GREAT BUY I absolutely love my new phone I upgraded from the s4 and what a difference This phone is so fast and sleek Only 4 stars on value because I think all phones are overpriced But love love love my phone Love the phone Super fast and the camera and screen look absolutely amazing Water resistant and wireless charging are awesome features Only downside so far is that ATT adds so much bloatware on the phone I went from a note 4 to the S7 edge so my review can be one sided The note is a monster but the S7 does keep up I have to get used to the design of it because of the edges On the note the square shape was easy but maybe my hand just feels weird because of my note 4 I am waiting for the VR so I can really get into it Touch sensitive x10 yes the screen will sometimes go where you dont want it to go Just hovering over the screen will click into that spot Fast charge is a plus works the same as my note 4 did overall nice phone wish it had option to change battery I love the speed and reaction time but didnt realize the back of case was glass so now 1 day into it its cracked Also after 5 days the power button and volume down button stopped working Sure its a software bug that will get workout but did concern me nice product very lightweiht and nice color the phone is very recomendable I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 to the S7 Very happy so far Nice design battery has lasted 38hrs so far from using the wireless quick charge cradle and still  24 Still getting to know all the new features Excellent features new aspect and excellent for gaming And the best water and dust proof I love how easy it is to navigate around the phone I had and iPhone 6 and Ill say this Ill never buy another iPhone again the camera on this phone front and back is just amazing cant get any better  Overall Im impressed with the phone My only gripes come from marshmallow The status bar is my biggest complaint Its to small Especially on a sunny day I have to actively search for information on it It should be customizable or at least bigger I love the always on screen but would like to add more things to it like the weather and alarm settings I need to play with it more so I can comment further but overall Im impressed feature rich fast and modern love the phone thanks for bringing back ext storage the display is incredibly bright even in sunlight Pre ordered this phone  Got the phone shipped in todayAnazing piece of hardware right out of the box Sleek and takes amazing pictures even in low light

Worth every penny  Best phone ever Started with galaxy s4 now this love it Absolutly love the improvements this year The rounded edges in back are a super improvment and wow oh wow battery is A I recently switched to the Galaxy S7 from a S5 as Samsung has also been a reliable fantastic phone with very minimal issues From the start setup was not easySmart Switch which Ive raved about did not work Then it was mobile networkor lack of Then an hour long visit to the store to get a factory reset of what little had been restored from memory SighI will not be keeping this phone I will say that the design is beautifulyet very heavy I love it so far I do not have anything bad to say really I do have one thing I wish it had a music player to download songs to like my other samsung had But I think its fast and on point with what you want to do So far Im happy Plus I love the new gold color it it truly nice Was using an s5 before and its been a week i bought this phone and i love it until now Works great even Underwater Just got it and the phone is great The setup takes a while but other than that its good I am very excited to see what this phone can do After restarting my device several times doing a soft reset and reconfiguring my WiFi the phone would not connect to my home WiFi router Not to mention it wouldnt allow me to use any of my preinstalled apps This phone has a lot of bugs and it needs to be fixed I recommend not buying his phone and wait until they iron out all the Kinks first First time back on a galaxy phone since the first one and what a great product Samsung made Amazing screen sleek water proof powerhouse with microSD and a solid battery Ive always been a fan of Samsung and this phone doesnt disappoint Its only been a week and I love this phone Great features new and old with excellent reception The calculator app that comes with the phone is faulty well at least mine is
Try this equation 1356  25  1695 but on my phone is totals to 1381 which is incorrect
Does anyone else have this problem The good

Full device encryption not a Samsung exclusive i know but just a great feature for them to leave enabled not set up by default

The bad
The backplate is glass meaning much like the fourth iteration of the fruit branded phones  the back panel is subject to potential breakage if dropped or mishandled PUT A CASE ON YOUR PHONE lol

Carried branding I know its outside of your control Samsung I just would like to see a phone on Big Red without all the Big Red bloat I am not knocking off points for this cause the bloatware can be disabled they just use space in the system partition thus taking space from the overall storage of the phone

My only other comment Im coming from one of those phones with the fancy name licensed by a film company that was purchased by a mouse with big round ears getting around using the actual brand names requires some creativity Well the previous handset I had had a 3500MAH battery and a finely tuned system for that battery so the shock of going from 2 days between charges to a phone that lasts a day at most encryption uses a lot of juice Im figuring can be a little disconcerting considering the S7 sports a 3000MAH battery When I think Samsung cant get no betterthey always seem to amaze me with their outstanding new features Thanks for bringing back the expandable memory Samsung are the BEST cellphone industry As I hold the phone in my hand to write this review The stunning response to the touch to the vivid display is just down right amazing Loving it User friendly Zero lag when playing app games Videos and pictures are crystal clear Unlike any mobile phone I have owned Needs remove able batter to get 5 stars Love the expandable storage space Also the free VR is just a bonus Our new SG S7 edge is just gorgeous The design is sleek and eyecatching The layout of the aps is convenient and moving them around just as easy The aps have easy instructions and if unsure how to proceed there are easy prompts as well We already had the Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphones and a tablet as well which makes the S7 edge even easier to use We will have alot of fun checking out the new updated parts and experience the newest technology seemingly very eaily I had gotten an S7 for my guy but was so enthusiastic I just had to have one of my own My first smart tab I ever purchased was an IPAD2 which I thoroughly enjoyed but the IPHONES all seem about the same in layout and setup plus didnt seem to be compatible with alot of apsprograms that I had wanted to get I am hardly an expert in this department but this is my opinion We will stay with SamSung thanku very muchGO SAMSUNG Cant wait to setup other Samsung home products to use in conjunction with my cellstab Also there is a SamSung ap that can guide you as well if necessary easily downloads and provides 247 assistance MS just got my S7 and I love it its slim design fast charging and long lasting battery are great and picture quality are excellent The phone is great The new Android OS is fast very responsive with the Samsung hardware The screen is bright and crisp and very responsive I love the fact that it came with an adapter to transfer the programs and data from my old phone very convenient The controls are conveniently located and the home buttonfingerprint scanner works a lot better than my old S5 The sound is clear and crisp for both calls and audio from music and video playback The video playback is smooth and hidef Streaming is smooth and doesnt overburden the hardware of course your results are dependent on your wifi or data provider The exterior is nice though I put mine in am Otterbox case right away so it doesnt really matter much to me The camera is spectacular The change in the aperture is very noticeable in low light the pictures are almost as good as my DSLR Havent taken any video yet but expect it to be good too The way the programs are listed is still taking me a little to get used to but that is the OS as are some of the other changes The only thing I wish that was different was that Samsung had taken advantage of the ability to expand the system memory to the SD card You can still move programs to the SD card but it is still a different space as far as the OS is concerned That and a removable battery and this phone would be perfect I still highly recommend it This product looks great and exceeds my expectations for a phone I decided to switch from iPhone to this Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and I will not be going back Extremely satisfied Hands down the sleekest phone out there Samsung has done it again They just keep raising the bar Although this wasnt a huge difference from the s6 imo Cant imagine what all the hardworkers will come up with next CANT WAIT Till then I wait in line like a kid going on his first rolllercoaster ride 

Kudos
 RRendon I had been using an S6 Edge for the last year That is a great looking phone but I had to get a 64gb version to handle all my media My biggest gripe with that phone was that I had to carry an external battery with me everywhere I would go to zero in about 6 hours The S7 Edge is game changer I can get to the end of my my work day with 6570 battery life left The SD card expandability screen size and water resistance are just icing on the cake I now have a great looking phone that I can use pretty much until I go to sleep This phone has great featuresA longer battery life than my old galaxy S4 Faster charging Im still learning all the great new features But so farIts been great Recently switched from iPhone and dont regret my decision one bit Great phone and doesnt take long to get used to I find cool new features every day I wish they had a better music app for playing downloaded songs Im not one for streaming I am very happy about the ease of setup and transferring data from my old phone This phone is fast right sized and convenient The best feature for me is the expandable memory Everything seems great and I love my phone EXCEPT when the phone arrived it seams to have a hairline crack in the lens of the main camera  great phone and the features are awesome good job samsung Ive had the 3 the 5 and now the S7 Edge What can I say it does everything perfectly AND its dust and water resistant Well done Samsung I love my galaxy S7 It is quick and has an excellent display I am amazed by the quality of pictures it can take I love the size not too big but not too small Overall I am very happy with my purchase Nice phone but the SD card is buggy The rest of the phone is awesome I mostly like the new S7  except for a few minor things but I am not sure if its because its a Verizon feature or a Samsung feature because I havent found it on either website yet when researching the phone 
I dont like that I am not able to change the Ugly icons and size of them I cant find the keyboard speech to text and it makes me record and immediately sends wout letting me check it firstplus I dont like my voice on it Im not crazy about the canned tones and what a pain it is to set up news ones in the folder and when you do it resets EVERTHING you already had set including the Alarm tones I dont particularly care for the fact that although it is Technically a 32gb phone before I even get it they use right at 10gb to just load phone stuff  most of that irritates me as their default and it takes an act of congress to change or get around kind of wish they would let me common sense test it before they sold them there are a few more things that bug me but I will eventually either get over it or just never use that function  and if you have to download an app to fix stuff they usually ask for too many permissions that really irritates me OH and the mini tray with the sim card and the memory card slot heaven forbid you open it and it flies off somewhere cause the tiny cards dont sit in the tray well and like to move around and fly off places That really wasnt thought through well you almost need tweezers to handle it 
As for the Pro side  I like the vibrancy of the screen the thumbprint lockunlock ability the sound and so far the camera Honestly for the sum totalI really miss a lot of features that my S3 had but am hopeful I can work the kinks out of the S7 and grow to love it The phone is great but I have noticed one problem so far The WiFi will either not connect or has severely reduced performance I have found through reading some forums that if the bluetooth is turned off the WiFi will then work properly I have in fact verified this to be the case Hopefully Samsung comes out with an update for this soon It is a great phone although it takes some getting used to
My lock screen button stopped working and the touch is ultra sensitive Recently switched to Galaxy S7 Edge from Note 4 still about the same size just a little narrower love that 
Love the edge light when faced down and the night clock 
Dont miss the stylus at all didnt really use it that much 
Do like the expandable memory was the main reason I didnt get the Note5 
Overall great design Wonderful phone Great features Love it Going to get another for wife when she can upgrade Makes hands off driving much simpler Easy features Its one of the greatest phones I have used 
Every thing about it is great but I am having a little trouble using fingerprint I love my new samsung smartphone S7 edge Which you satisfy what I want on my phone and has very claer photo which no one other brands has it The last Samsung device I used was a Galaxy II I have used various other brands over the years and I am not for one second disappointed I made the switch back to Samsung Amazing features Sleek design Love the expandable memory option This product is nothing it awesome I would recommend it to my family and friends I had an iPhone since they came out and just switched to the Galaxy best decision ever Overall amazing phone 

Incredible features
Camera
Battery Life
Functionality
Syncing of Email messaging and contacts
List goes on and on

Only thing I miss is not being able to FaceTime my wife and kids while I travel Using Skype for the time being but would love to see that feature added between the two companies if they can This product has great features overall and speed I have been waiting for this S7 to be released I preordered and so desperately wanted to love this phone Upgraded fron the S4 My S7 lasted 2 days overheating numerous times and then malfunctioning After 40 minutes of phone time with the very patient Verizon rep I went back to exchange the phone by recommendation of rep 2nd S7 lasted 4 days Overheating although not as much as first one I trouble shooted this to try and correct Then I couldnt access Internet on wifi As soon add I turned wifi off I was able to use phone at full function Was having issues with some of my apps unable to open my email On the 4th day my phone battery was down to 30 by 230pm taken off charger at 530am and normal use that day Overall I got very frustrated with the phone so I returned it and reactivated my S4 I am considering an iphone vs the note 5 Ill have to research more I have moved from the S3 to the S5 and now the S7 The S7 is by far the greatest Galaxy phone to date All the features you love about the Galaxy series AND they brought back the SD card Moving my contacts took less than 5mins and they even bought back my 2 year old S5
Battery life is much better than the S5 which would have to be charged it before leaving work The S7 is usually about 50 off and on use throughout the day by the time my day is done This phone is fast crisp and clear picture and has turned into my favorite phone
Try it out youll be glad you did Overall easy to use fits well in hand Picture quality is excellent even in low light First samsung phone but very impressed Great phone Had S4 prior to this so far love I would recommend this No complaints with this phone at all Camera is great Functionality wise I love this phone I couldnt be happier with the camera and all of the new features I upgraded from the S4 so quite a bit has changed The phone looks sleek and top of the line However I was extremely disappointed that within 8 hours of taking the phone out of the box the glass on the back of my phone already broke and spidered I took it back to my provider to see what they recommended and they told me to get ahold of Samsung because they have never seen something like this happen so quickly I didnt drop my phone or anything In fact I would say I was being extremely cautious Just like anyone is when they have a new phone You guard it with your life to make sure it stays in mint condition as long as possible Anywayafter talking to customer service at Samsung they told me I had to take it back to my provider so it could be sent in for repair I havent had the chance to do that yet but I will be interested to see if other people report the same problem Nice phone Enjoy the crystal clear screen Nice size in hand Very fast and responsive Enjoy all the nice features packed into the phone Absolutely love my new s7 I previously mentioned that the battery life could be better but I just had to make some adjustments I bought a wireless charger for the phone and that also works greatI love samsung products and the s7 dont disappoint I instantly fell in love with this product I initially got it for its water resistant features but after using it for the last few days Ive come to rely on a lot more Ill get the hang of it soon enough but the battery life is a major drain needs a better max app Iffeciancy battery life on the plus side the speed charge is a major plus as long as youre near an outletI hope this one doesnt explode Im so excited about my new Galaxy S7 phone I decided to upgrade from the S5 I still am getting aclamated ans astounded by the new features I will continue to enjoy and expand my experience with this new upgraded smart phone Right out of the box it amazes with the crystal clear visuals The speed of apps opening and then the simplicity of the way everything behaves A simple touch here the camera comes on a quick swipe here your favorite apps appear I went to a concert the day I bought it and recorded great quality videos and the sound quality was amazing I hope to run this baby to the ground so many great ideas of what Im going to do with this Thanks SAMSUNG Love the storage capacity it being waterproof the built in speaker ando pretty much everything about it Im still finding features and improvements The quick connect allows me to view the content from my Samsung TV on my with with audio The quick charger is fast and efficient The display is crisp and bright With heavy use the phone will last all day with bluetooth connected to my Gear Live and connected to my companys WiFi The fingerprint reader is more accurate I would recommend this phone for new and experienced users 1st love the phone Vast improvement over my Galaxy s4 The screen is amazing colors so vibrant Everything works great as expected Apps load very quickly Would definitely recommend My gripes Coming from the s4 and s3 and Blackberry I am used to the plastic feel The s7 being made with more metals and glass on the back I am very over cautious and afraid of breaking it I opted for an Otter Commuter case instead of a minimalist case because I am just so afraid of damaging it Samsung WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE IR BLASTER Was using the s4 as my home theater remoteno more Disappointed Ultrafast scrolling in Apps like Facebook are still not as fastfluid as iphone It isnt bad its actually pretty good but I would love to see Samsung match the evil empires fluidity because then there wouldnt be anything the Galaxy couldnt match on the iphone Thankfully the expandable memory is there had it on my s4 would have hated to not have it Camera is awesome love the new features make sure you download the new modes like rear camera selfie I am very excited to own this phone and I would highly recommend it to my friends I love the curved edge of the phone and it is so easy to hold onto Love iteasy to usegreat hand feelextremely intuitivehad a Samsung 3very happy with the transitiontransferring data from the 3 to the 7 was so easy and seamless The phone works great out of the box and after spending some time digging through the settings I find it easy to find what I need and what all the features do The ability to capture screenshots from webpages and continue capturing for that uninterrupted effect is a great plus Camera quality is fantastic and a definite step up from my S4 Minieven though Ill be honest the mini as a whole was pretty great too Chose this over the S7 Edge because I prefer to not have those curved screen edges Gonna take some getting used to in terms of size and still slightly miffed that the background wallpaper isnt scrollable anymoreyes still Has included face chat feature for those who also have an S7 So if you know a bunch of friends who didnt jump onboard the iPhone bandwagon or are looking to switch but held off due to the facetime this has got ya covered Expandable memory up to 200GB but youll have to wait to get home to upgrade since it requires a special toolcomes with it to access the memory slot Non removable battery is another feature but not sure if Im happy about that just yet Time will tell Yes its also pretty smudgy but thats what cases are for It seems to be a great phone I wish ATT didnt pre load a ton of apps I dont need Ive only had it 1 day Still trying to figure out why my bottom volume button on the left side doesnt do anything Also disappointed that I havent got a text to talk button like my s6 had Im sure things will present themselves but comon man Integrates seamlessly with Galaxy Tab S2 Takes high quality pictures I am still in discovery mode Very easy to use love the galaxy phones my last 3phones have been Galaxy I had the S6 and enjoyed it I thought that was nice but the S7 is so worth it The feel of the phone is alittle lighter and feels oh so smoother I love that the camera and home button are flat and not sticking out anymore Same awesome sound quality as the s6 I thought the battery was long lasting on the s6 this phone definitely out dose it It is faster and more responsive all together then the s6 and so far no occasional annoying pop ups like the s6 had The extra storage and waterproof features are a plus The camera photos are more crisp and bright It controls the lighting better I like the new mini control feature that can pop up when youre playing a game or app It allows you to silence calls while youre playing and lock your home buttons if you want so you cant accidentally exit There is so much more to explore I cant even think of upgrading in the future this phone has everything I wanted This phone isnt bad just got it clear screen need to get use to the new style but still a good phone This is the best handset I have ever owned Its the perfect size It fits nicely in my new Tahoes console lid that charges it wirelessly The quickness of the operating system is seamless The screen is second to none All I can say isBOOM Love the feel the look the camera Spilt screen is so COOL Check it out I Love mine  I honestly feel this is the best and top smartphone yet I love its design Even with the nice classy design it is still completely waterproof So many great features with this new amazing phone Way better than iPhone I can tell yang that for sure Unfortunately the phone I received will not activate It only allows me to make emergency calls or turn the device off Ordered to try out the watch but didnt have much luck filing claim as I was unable to locate WiFi Mac  since I couldnt get in the phone and now they are sold out Bad experience all around the board Guess Im stuck with the Note 3 a little while longer To put it bluntly it is like comparing a Chevy to a Porsche The phone is beautiful It is incredibly faster The huge boost in memory is a great addition as well Dont get me wrong the s4 was great for its time but the upgrade was well worth it Cant wait for my vr headset I love this phone It does it all and it looks great Great battery life and awesome camera Forget iPhones get a S7 As an older person I was nervous about setting up my new phone The instructions provided online at Samsung were wonderfully easy for me to understand and carry out 
I love the simplicity and ease of use for the Galaxy S7
Displays are easy to see and apps easy to use
Can you tell I love it and will tell everyone how much Thanks GalaxySamsung for this product I have to say this is my first Samsung anything My last phone was just a Droid and I only got it cause it was free so I was stuck with it for two years until now Now I got my galaxy s7 and its amazing its perfect The camera is clear and takes perfect pictures The phone screen is the perfect size in my opinion Its note huge like the note and not to small like the Droid mini Everything is clear and crisp on the screen as well So watching HD movies and and games is immaculate The phone is light weight slim with great battery life Phone came with a fast charger which is awesome Also came with great ear phones I love all the features and functions and apps on this phone I recommend that anyone looking for a new phone to choose a Samsung Galaxy  I plan on sticking with this brand and buy more of their products So far I am loving the S7 Edge Very comfortable feel very nice ez transition from the S5 active I had Didnt loose any apps or info I had stored on the prior phone Missed calls dropped calls issues with watching videos 9gb out of 32gb already used leaving around 20 gb space on the phone left Although the phone has ability for added memory my s6 was already full so i need to buy more memory just to maintain the phone to be used Pretty much the s6 with waterproofing and external memory Seeing as ive never dropped my previous phones in a toilet not too much has changed The external memory is the best feature Battery life is great compare to my S4 and S6
I love the camera they are so clear the color of the image is so clear I had the Samsung Galaxy S5 for a year and half and really enjoyed it as a phone It was highly customizable expandable memory reliable had a good battery life and the option to throw in a new battery should I run through one and overall performed very well

It did have its issues which in my opinion were iffy camera quality in low lighting and some lag with processing power After a year and half I was noticing overall slower performance and heating issues

Where the S6 abandoned all the good things about the S5 the S7 brought them back I threw in a 200 GB memory card for all my music and photos and the 32 GB capacity overall is much better for apps you want directly on your phone The processor is FAST Opening apps and browsing the web are a snap The camera is beautiful  quick crisp clear 

The transition over from my S5 to the S7 was also incredibly painless I was able to hook the 2 phones to each other with a piece included in the S7s packaging and within an hour my new phone had all the apps photos messages contacts and videos my old phone had

The dust and water rating on the S7 are a huge plus I did like that my S5 was water resistant but the bulky charger flap was kind of awkward this phone has removed all awkward bulkiness including the protruding camera bump the back is now more smooth and even rounded to hold

I also got a wireless charging pad for my phone and I think its really cool I dont use the fast charge for day to day stuff but its nice just to put your phone on the charging pad and wake up to a fully charged phone sans wire

I also got an external battery in case I needed it throughout the day but even with consistent usage the batter lasts me 10 hours at least usually going 12 or more

The phone looks slick virtually no camera bump on the back yay and you still have the heart rate monitor and other cool built in features I loved about my S5 No floating toolbox but that is downloadable

I recommend getting some kind of case because the exterior shows all smudges and smears because it is such a slick shiny phone Also it is an expensive and impressive piece of tech def worth protecting I got a clear spigen to protect the phone but also show it off

I am so excited to have switched over I reallllllly love my S7 D I love it I have almost everything that the note 5 have I am in love with it I upgraded from a S4 Worth the upgrade I love the new curved design It is easier to hold and grips better in my hand With double the ram from the S4 I can do many things at once and it doesnt slow down New UHD screen with a beautiful picture and the camera is much improved I think it takes much crisper pictures than my wifes not android phone You wont regret buying this phone I love the quickness of the camera and launching apps The battery life is great but that is expected for a new phone I guess Much louder speaker and clearer than my S4 I am glad I waited for this one I saw the S6 but wasnt ready to ditch my S4 My old phone messed up copying data over to new phone but hooked up cable as S7 did the rest Smooth interface and load times are great I havent tried getting it wet but it looks and feels like it can handle it Just not going to go swimming with it lol Lots of compliments on gold colorway Phone is very good Speedy and intuitive Camera good not great Overall the best phone I have ever owned This is the ultimate phone The best of the 5 and 6 but better than both Samsung just dropped the mic Its sexy fast great pictures awesome video The load times are faster I mean Whooooo I have been an iOSiPhone user for years I decided to switch because I am a technology enthusiast and I wanted something new This phone competes very well with my previous iPhone 6s Excellent design battery software speed camera etc I would say that over all the phones are VERY similar it is mostly just a preference of software and a few smaller advantagesdisadvantages 

Advantages compared to iPhone 6s
Battery life
Design feels better in hand
Display quality
Waterproof
More customizable software


Disadvantages compared to iPhone 6s
Android software not as secure and reliable
Louder speakers
Better camera in most conditions
Faster TouchID This phone is very fast and the battery last a long time the device is very beautiful I JUST LOVE IT
keep up the good work Samsung LOVE the galaxy S 7 egde I upgraded from a GS5 and absolutely love the GS7 Edge It has all the features that I wanted to keep from my previous phone expandable storage  water resistance but upgraded everything else The camera is superb the battery lasts me two days between charges and the fast charging is great My next accessory purchase will be a fast car charger or a fast wireless charger I just switched from iPhone and I absolutely love this phone Its more like a computer There are so many features on this thing Im loving it The themes are super cute and fit my personality By far the best phone on the market Features are amazing I avoided the S7 edge because I dont like how it makes it difficult for screen protectors to fit well And yet for some reason the S7 screen is still slightly curved making my screen protector edges stick up Im also not crazy about their decision to make the back glass as well Just makes it more breakable The S5 was much more rugged Hardware looks impressive but a couple apps have crashed already and the touchscreen is occasionally unresponsive The S5 was much more impressive when it came out Overall I do recommend the S7 The screen is great minus the lag time with manufacturers of screen protectors getting their act together to cover the curved edges of the screen but thats not the phones fault hardware is great and it operates very smoothly Camera is also very good from the few tests Ive done in the past week and I love the microSD card slot My only gripe is the battery Maybe I had my expectations set too high before I got the phone but it doesnt seem to be holding a charge like a brandnew battery with this capacity should 

My older phone was a little over 2 years old and had a 2300mAh battery HTC One M7 On a daily basis I use my phone at work minimally  check email a few times browse the internet at lunch etc and maybe a few texts but thats it No gaming no extensive browsing or app usage I even hibernate apps Im not using to save battery My old phone would hit about 50 battery at lunch time and around 200pm Id have to charge it so it wouldnt die before the end of the day I expected that from an old phone with a smaller by todays standards battery 

The new S7 has a 3000mAh battery should hold a charge like a new battery and is using a newer version of Android which is supposed to be more efficient With the same usage Im finding that the battery is around 60 after using it at lunch time Somehow I was expecting to go home after work with 60 battery leftmaybe that expectation isnt realistic It just seems like it wouldnt hold up at all to a full day of photos web usage navigation etc if I was out on vacation or something 

Again overall this is a great phone and its not like the battery is worse than what I had previously I just expected a bit more from a new phone with higher capacity than my old phone Awesome phone Easy to navigate Being water resistant will ease my mind when I go to the lake I was a Windows Phone user that was willing to try an Android phone and am I ever glad I did The Galaxy S7 Edge is a wonderful intuitive phone that feels light years ahead of my old Lumia 920 As all the reviews out there will tell you there are few if any flaws with the new S7 I just traded in my Edge  which I loved but got tired of the larger size not fitting into any regular sized pocket Additionally I love that Samsung added back the SD card capability along with the water resistance and dust proof Performance is outstanding I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S4 to the S7 EdgeIve had my eye on this phone for a while and Im glad I bought it While it is expensive it is a great phone and it comes with 32 Gb which is much nicer than my previous 16Gb Theres something about having a screen with the edge that is very appealing to the eyes I definitely love it so far It is pricey but new phones always are So far it has been worth it Ive had every Samsung Galaxy since the S3 and the S7 is by far the best Galaxy ever made Brilliant camera smooth curved back And just overall a wonderful phone This phone never lags I can run so many programs in the background with everything running smoothly 
This phone has a very crisp display Runs 60 marshmallow android which in my opinion is the best android yet 
12MP rear camera 5MP front camera  4GB of RAM 3000MAH battery The best phone out there Great everything including storage and in depth photography Everything about it is incredible There isnt one thing I dont like Im loving my new galaxy s7 battery life is great Really loving the water resistant feature Figuring out all the new stuff they really did a bunch of new things with this and the camera is amazing Screen is very vibrant and responsive Download speed is very fast the style is very elegant and sophisticated So far this is a very good phone The last samsung that I had was the S3 and it was a great phone They seemed to lose direction with the S4 and S5 then getting back on track with the S6 They have redeemed themselves with the S7 edge and seemed to have listened to the customers complaints of previous models Love the fact that the memory slot is back and also the time display without having to power up the phone is very nice The camera also takes amazing pictures front and rear camera So far I would give this phone a 10 This phone is incredible I used a friends for a couple of weeks and there was just no way I could pass it up To be honest I opted out from the S6 because I felt it was a step backwards as far as innovation but this Galaxy S7 is definitely a refined version of my existing S5 With the camera improvements loss of the charger flap and retention of the water resistance and huge performance gain I am as happy as can be Thank you Samsung This is my first samsung phone and it is awesome device I consider this easy to use but I used to have a Galaxy III so am also pretty familiar with Galaxy features I actually paid off an LG4 I only had for a few months to get the Galaxy 7 Now with the 7 I can talk on the phone without dropping calls when people text or message me or dial in It is smaller which I prefer than the LG4 or the Edge  it can fit in a pocket much easier I have horses so the water and dust resistance is terrific The only thing I wish could be different is where the power button is located It is too easy to hit and get the black screen Well worth that minor irritant though LOVE it LOVE it Also it would be nice if the battery lasted longer That was the ONLY thing the LG4 had as an advantage Galaxy is the way to go Good design battery lasts up to 3 days with normal use
Easy to use Fast charging
Multiple features for camera I havent had this phone very long but I fell on love with it when I first got it Samsung does it again I had the original galaxyS with slide out keyboard Then I switched to iphone4I quickly realized my mistake and have had the s5 and now the s7 So far it has blown me away great feel great camera expandable storage I love it I love the way its made off metallic platform and wellheld handling Especially my favorite point is professional builtin camera Now I can rock anywhere with it Phone is fast brilliant color big screen great value Better than any other Samsung phone it has everything I need and tons of new things The edge style is so cool and also I waned a great looking phone and something other than a iphone Great job on this phone This phone is more then just a phone With the expandable storage the music video and movies will always be endless It will hold up to 200 gb It is ok that the apps can only be installed to the onboard system storage The water proof of this phone is the greatest thing ever Getting the VR until free with the purchase of the phone is the best bonus ever Samsung has hit the mark with this phone I HAVE HAD MY PH FOR 4 DAYS NOW AND I AM STILL SEEKING PLACES TO GO IM HOPING FOR A SUCCESSFUL WEEK OF FINDING MY PLACES AND MANEAUVERS BUT IM GLAD I TRADED I had the s6 edge for a short while With a Samsung charging pad it would charge up and then stop with an error on the charger and discharge overnight Same pad works flawlessly with the S7 I have had the phone for a week now no problems encountered

Camera takes great low light pictures looks great on the screen and on other computers No perceptible delays snapping shots

I just added a 64g memory card no surprises and it automatically reconfigured to store pictures on it No air view features and the battery gets hot while on WiFi network Also why did Samsung take away talk to text feature where there is a messaging app I see talk to text app yet there are no microphones buttons on keyboards in text messaging app Love this phone the s7 edge is awesome Its so easy to use The photos it takes are great I love samsung products So the first good thing about this phone is its design It is slim and sleek Its shape is a brothersister to the iPhone 66s Very similar However it does have a slightly longer screen but not too much wider All the little features are nice and what you come to expect of Samsung droid phones I have noticed the backside heating up a bit more than I like after a short time of doing setup activities with the phone Then again the iPhone 6s I have is just as bad with a heated up back Such is life when the battery is so close to the backside All in all a worthy phone for droid users and potential Apple users as well since the look and feel is about the same I love my new S7Edge speed performance and specifications Have had many different brands of smart phones This one is for my use the best one ever Would recommend it to anyone I like the designweightcamera and the vr very realistic This phone is great I am pleased after upgrade from S6 edge Looks good feels good features great Appreciate the waterresistant aspect too  I am very happy with the phone the features are exactly what I wanted I have hearing aids and this phone got a Hearing Aid Compatibility rating of M4T3 That means it exceeds the Microphone Standard and meets the Telecoil Standard
I do notice excellent call quality when using Bluetooth to my hearing aids and so does parties with whom I am have a conversation
I look forward to using a Video Call
I am very pleased with my Galaxy S7 I finally upgraded from my 3 year old Galaxy S3 and WOW what a difference I was disappointed with the S6 and I am glad I held out for the S7 This thing is FAST Easy to use and the camera takes incredible pix It was great to be able to transfer all my aps with the smart transfer feature or whatever its called Even worked without issue with my old S3 Battery life seems to be excellent also As I type this my phone has been off the charger for 11 hours now and Ive been using it most of the day and I still have 70 of the battery left

If youve been holding out like I was you dont have to any longer I have always wanted the customization of android but in the past found it hard to do things easy but this phone is awesome I love it It feels so good and smooth and the personalization is great Very happy with the cell I love the quality of the photos the screen and the sound is spectacular This is the greatest phone ever I love Samsung Phones and I was happy the company released the most beautiful and greatest phone
It is really super fast and easy to use
I will definitely recommend Already did this phone or S7 to my friends and colleagues Love the phone just a great phone out performed most other phones It slide out of the box when I opened it all of 6 onto the counter and the lens cracked Hoping the wifi issues get resolved soon my phone wont stay connected Verizon said it is because not all apps are updated to work with the new marshmallow system I am eating up my data because my phone locks up on anything I try to do when I try to connect to wifiit wont stay connected Otherwise the phone would be great Love my new phone So far so good Just bought it so I havent had the time to check it all out The feature that I really miss is the music square option when listening to my stored music I used it all the time Please please bring it back Fingers crossed Great device but very expensive If you really want the best you should get the S7 The battery life is much better than the previous S6 And the camera is still awesome as ever I highly recommend this device to anyone that wants the latest and great I just got the galaxy S7 and so far so good great features and good size This phone is so sleek and has great features The price along with the perks make this phone a fantastic value GET ONE NOW The Samsung s has met all my expectations Great camera fast Go get one I have to say I love almost everything about this phone I had an S5 and I waited for this because I wanted another waterproof phone It was easy to set up and transfer my info except that a few contacts didnt transfer for some reason My only real issue is that the Bluetooth cuts out and is distorted I stream Amazon Prime Music from my S5 to a wireless speaker in my office everyday With the S7 the connection shuts off after 1 or 2 songs Sometimes it speeds up slows down or buffers as well Fortunately I kept my S5 so I can just use that to stream music over wifi and use my S7 for everything else Honestly the fastest most feature laden and attractive mobile Ive ever had It is amazing that Samsung can keep improving a perfect phone I LOVE everything about this product except for one BIG problem Id give it all 5 stars if it wasnt for this issue The wifi and bluetooth have some kind of interference Ive tried this now on 2 different networks One of which was a fiber line If I turn the bluetooth on the downup wifi speed drops to almost zero Very frustrating There are a lot of things I can do on this phone that I couldnt do on my old one One is watching videos Even though I am still learning about this phone I am spending too much time on it already I just purchased the S7 Edge I love this phone It is very light love that I no longer had to get the Active versions to have the waterproof feature I am a clutz so the Actives were great now I can have a more stylish phone with some of the qualities from the Active versions Ive only had my S7 Edge for a day or so but I do really dig it so far Its a lot nicer than Id expected before jumping ship from the vendor I used to get my devices from Well done Samsung I havent been in the Smart Phone world for very long I had another manufacturers phone and it kept giving me trouble The battery didnt last long it would randomly reboot itself etc When that phone died I used another brand of phone and it was complicated and finicky

The s7 Edge on the other hand has been a delight It is easy to use uptodate and it has features I never would have thought Id need

The edge readout is perfect for use as a clock at night Thumb print access is fantastic The battery lasts twice as long as my old one even though this device is bigger and better And the different ways you can set up the phone feel almost limitless

A Ive had a phone from every major brand and this is by far my favorite one Every phone maker out is scratching their heads right now This is an amazing design with performance that matches its beauty I cant imagine whats next Really like my new phone the forward camera flash is great for meI wish they kept the whistle notification sound My only issue is I cant get the sound to work on my text messages once I get that sorted out I will be satisfied with this product I am so in love with this phone the features are so great Can wait to upgrade the other lines to this product Ive had the Samsung Galaxy S7 for a week now and so far I have not been dissapointed This is the first non Nexus device Ive used in over 2 years and honestly I dont mind Samsung has taken Stock Android and improved the experience in many ways The UI allows you to make many customizations like themeing the entire UI to make it more unique and have a dark menu  Also Samsung Pay works like a champ I pretty much use it anywhere that I use to swipe my card If only they would start taking it at restaurants then I probably wouldnt need my wallet any more One improvement Samsung could make to Samsung pay is to allow you to enter reward cards like Android Pay does Then I wouldnt even need android pay

But this is absolutely the fastest phone that Ive ever used Theres never any stutters or lag I havent had to restart my phone yet The battery life is usually around 40 when I go to bed which is way higher than previous phones The camera is amazing I literally have no complaints at this point

Good Job Samsung Love How Easily This Phone Is To Set Up and Love The Details On the phone Also Calls are crisp and Clear Easy To Learn With All Of the Learning Features If you make a line better dont you add more features to it and not take them away from it I replaced my Razr Maxx with this phone Its taking some getting used to for me but at least I can call tech support when I have questions The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the battery life I dont know if mine is defective but I have to charge it every day When I went to bed last night I had 90 power When I woke up I had 80 without using it at all last night I dont know if I got a defective battery or not I guess I will be giving tech support another call today This Samsung galaxy 7 edge is super especial I never see something like this have great features and design is unique this technology is awesome the waterproof is so cool and the screen edge is fantastic I love Samsung i have everything from Samsung this is not only a great phone IS A GALAXY Everything is so easy to find and manage on the S7 I recently bought a samsung s7 edge black Great design Built quality is much better than previous samsung phones It has one of the best camera available in the market Packaging is also neat The edge screen and split screens are really great to use 
Now if we go to cons the product is quite expensive comparing to other phones in the market Also samsung removed the important functions such as music player cellular data onoff shortcut etc Customer required to download these from internet Another problem I faced was the keyboard You cant type it with one hand When you try to do that you palm will be always touching the screen and it makes very difficult And the phone isnt scratch proof 
Overall this is good product But little too expensive for a waterproof phone I love it overall it has everything that I need and more My girlfriend loves her cell She has a galaxy 4 which she loved but her galaxy 7 edge was the one she was waiting for The galaxy 7 edge is everything it has been written about Easy to use lightweight great display Good deal also Just had the phone over a day now Great display and the expandable memory is a huge plus I just wished it included an ir blaster like the s4 had I ended up using that phone many times as a tv remote The headphone jack should be at the top of the phone otherwise its awesome Just switched over from iphone The display and the camera is awesome I held off upgrading to the S6 last year because it was missing some of the things I had come to love in the S5 This time around they took what was great from the S6 and improved upon it
Visually the S6 looks very similar to the S7 which is a good thing in my opinion It is almost a shame to put a case on the phone and although I get tempted I plan on protecting it for long term usage

Pros Youve probably heard it all before 
Ill note that playing games on it is a lot of fun and the Gear VR is a great addition but if youre serious about gaming make sure you consider a game pad before investing in the headset
The fingerprint scanner is a nice upgrade too no longer is there a need to swipe Simply place your thumb or finger on the home button at any angle 
Subtle improvements to aesthetics and convenience are great but what I think really stands out is the new low lighting camera feature The very quick access double click focus and shutter speed combination also make catching that perfect unexpected shot that much more attainable even when lighting conditions are not favorable

Cons
I will admit I did need to talk to tech service once already due to an odd circumstance that led to my phone turning completely off when I plugged it into my computer simply turn it back on I thought but it wouldnt Tech support was however very helpful and I reset my phone with no loss of data I also havent had the problem since and honestly Im not too worried about it at this point
Ill also note that bluetooth range appears to be slightly shorter at least compared to the S5
Another note is VR streaming can be choppy at times even with fast internet although if you choose to download your content then I can attest that the experience was smooth and I had no VR sickness whatsoever The phone itself warmed up after extensive use during gaming but was definitely not uncomfortably hot as with other phones

Id personally say its an astounding upgrade from the S5 as for the S6 it will depend on how important the details are for you to make the jump This is by far the best Samsung product I have ever purchased It was designed with the user in mind It offers you anything and everything that you could ever want out of a smart phone So far really good and definitely best I have right now Excellent camera fantastic screen resoluion Great speaker location Battery life could last longer I just received my S7 on Friday March 11th to replace my S4 Out of the box I was impressed with the structure and the familiarity of the new S7 The transfer of my files pictures contacts videos accounts settings and apps was smooth and flawless I simply backed everything up which took the longest amount of time and then turned on the wireless transfer app Android Beam and touched them together and bam All my stuff was transferred to my new S7 in a matter of minutes  flawlessly I was impressed with how fast the phone charges  minutes I mean literally minutes folks The fingerprint log in is outstanding and easy to setup and use Pictures are beautiful even though the rear is only 12mps and the front camera is just as good even at only 5mps The low light setting for the camera is just  wow On my S4 a dark room would have been completely blacked out however on the S7 it is visible albeit with a yellow hint which is to be expected from such low lighting I dont plan on taking too many pictures in a dark room so think I can deal with that Love how the apps for Verizon Google and Amazon are grouped into one icon  fabulous  takes up less space in the apps pages On my S4 I had 4 or 5 pages of apps now I have 3 pages total I took it to work with me on Saturday and the battery lasted all day long  it has yet to go below 65 without needing a charge I topped it off this morning before going to work and right now it is still at 87  this is fantastic My old S4 would have to be charged everyday  not the S7 Of course the real test will come on Thursday when I am off and can really sit and play with it Then well see how long the battery lasts before needing a charge So so far I cant say enough about this phone I have used the alarm to wake me up for work and it is great at waking me on time Texting is simple and pretty much the same as with the S4 I had with the exception of the new emoticons added  I really like them The screen is beautiful And the fact that I have small hands with it being narrower I can actually use the phone one handed where I couldnt with my S4 My S4 has now been passed on to my husband and he is really loving it I may have just created another Galaxy fan Thanks Samsung and Verizon for another wonderful Galaxy product I will update this review later when I have a little more time with my new S7  but so far  I absolutely love it If you are scared to buy a new phone before all the glitches have been worked out  dont be with the S7  it is great straight out of the box Camera truly does have quick focus Would have liked to see 240fps slow motion on this device Sound is okay  could use a betterlouder speaker for watching videos or listening to music Display of phone is flawless Great phone love it Best phone out there  Easy to get music Im just upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the old flip phone I dont know why I waited so long All the technology  features I didnt realize how much time  effort I could save grate phone a little difficult to use at first but now I love it Finally replaced my Galaxy S3 with the S7 The difference is day and night The S7 is very fast and the display is like the difference between SD and HD TV Battery life also a great improvement Phone has been on 12 hours today and I have been messing with a lot and it still has 50 battery left Will recharge from 30 in about 15 hours Dont think any of these phones are worth the price we are being charged but what can we do if we want a great smart phonetheyve got us Regardlessthis IS a great phone I am happy with my purchase would buy it again and would definitely recommend it I love the way that it looks I like the gear vr that this phone goes into SD card is back which is awesomeThis phone is so easy to use that it feels like I have had it for years The short cuts are awesome on the edge Everything I need is just a finger point click away camera takes great pictures colors and so bright and clear Great features easy to handle not difficult Great speakers And Water Proof Upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S5 this is a huge improvement Its elegant its fast takes great pictures The SD card slot is the only reason I didnt get the S6 so that was nice to see come back The best thing you included in the box was the piece of hardware that let me plug my S5 into my S7 to transfer everything That was a breeze 
 I really like the new style headphones as well Cant forget to mention the massive battery thats lasted me 2 days almost 
 You really outdone yourselves this time in my opinion Well done I love my new phone It has so many features and works better than my iPhone did Im very happy I had the S4 and loved it S7 was a good replacement consistent with the similar operating system camera is definitely the best on the market even compared to iphone the Samsung galaxy has a great design and it show that the samsung company has listen to their samsung fans i love my new S7edge This is by far the best phone Ive ever owned Beautiful display and design water resistant and amazing camera want alse can you ask for not to mention the huge battery This phone can do everything but launch a rocket Absolutely amazing features wonderful feel in your hand and ease of use Easily the best smartphone Ive ever owned and would recommend to anyone Only had it for a couple of day but so far no problems No problem with transfers and downloads or calls Like the storage and being able to expand all the bells and whistles and the clarity of the pictures front and back are superb Thus great so far just bought the S7 yesterday I have had this phone for roughly a week now and I love it I am coming from a note 5 I am noticing better battery life and performance across the board The galaxy S7 sets the bar when it comes to customer comfort for enjoying the top newest technology out on the market Its fun to look at the curved edges super fast downloading speeds and tons of system operating options Love the phone love the wireless charging and loveven showing it off to my IPhone loving girlfriend Thank you Samsung this is the phone Ive been waiting for Received my new Galaxy S7 Edge last Tuesday and almost immediately fell in love It is beautiful it is sleek it is elegant it turns heads Headed out Wednesday to a conference and woman oh woman what a beast this battery is Lasted through my 5 hr drive even using Google Maps for the last hour over mountain roads and still had enough juice to finish out the afternoon of conference sessions with battery to spare AND the fast charger is exactly thatblazing fast Cant wait to try it out on the new Samsung stand fast charger ordered The screen is extremely beautiful and i LOVE the Edge panels Not much of a gamer but it is handling whatever I throw at it quickly Camera autofocus is certainly amazing Now cant wait to order my Sview cover Thanks Samsung for another amazing smartphone BTW mine is carrier Black and GORGEOUS When I bought this phone i had the S5 Galaxy this is hands down a much better product from day one Just pulling it out of the box and holding it you are impressed with the look and feel of the phone in your hand Then when you turn it on the use is fast abecoming very easy to use At this point I would recommend this over any other product on the market right now Upgraded from the s4 and this phone does not disappoint The S7 is very snappy and the camera takes awesome pictures Best phone have lovedone galaxy since s4 keep up good work I have only had this s7 edge for one day but i love that all the features that where missing from the s6 are on this one best phone i have had in years This new model has lots of great features with a sleek design The best mobile phone available Great features comfortable to use Longstanding fan of Samsung products and love everything about this phone  Im loving all the features this phone has What great pictures it takes Easy to learn for a Grandma I am still learning this phone but I love it I am especially satisfied with the ability to put my SD card in it The bigger battery is great Everything is new and takes getting used to Overall better by far than any other phone I have ever had Great camera features beautiful design  durable This is a terrific phone They really took the best features from the S5 and S6 and combined them to make a terrific phone Im thrilled the SD card is supported again That was what really sold me on this phone The only cons I have is that the bootloader is locked and rooting will be near impossible

Otherwise this is a terrific product and I would recommend it to everyone After a week of using this device I believe this is currently the best phone available I am amazed by the responsiveness to my input and the customization is phenomenal Has good design Highly recommend it to a friends This is a great phone The fit and finish is high quality The display is the brightest one I have used This is the first phone that I did not set the brightness level at max 
The always on background is a nice touch Finger print authorization works good The audio is acceptability 
The cellular bluetooth and wifi are all very good which is kind of important for a cell phone 
Battery life is good Wireless charging works good and is the way to go 
Big plus for bringing back the external memory capability I would not have got this otherwise
My minute annoyances are
1 The audio cannot play through my samsung docking station like it does with my S4
2 You cant connect this directly to a tv with the MHL micro usb to HDMI cable like my S4
3 No infrared remote again like my S4
1 and 2 above tend to bother me more as I bought equipment specifically to do that and planned to continue that Love the new removal memory Great new camera To top it off it is waterproof and that is a necessity for this Florida sportsman I received the new phone a couple of days ago and could not be more happy I finally decided it was time to move into the modern world and upgraded from a basic flip phone 
The Galaxy S7 is stylish fast and can do everything my iPad Air can do 
The set up was simple I had sent my contacts through Backup Assistant to the cloud and by the time I finished going through the set up steps my contacts and pic were on my new phone 
I connected to my WiFi at home and updated the operating system installed a few apps and I was all set 
Use of the phone is extremely intuitive I like it better than the smartphone my wife has from a different manufacturer that shall remain nameless 
My voice sounds like it is in a chamber when I listen on my wifes phone but her voice is crystal clear on mine She has had issues with voice quality from other phones before 
I highly recommend the S7 its a superfast phone the battery life is GREAT love the additional memory slot Without a doubt the build quality and looks are excellent Overall like the phone But experiencing issues with home WiFi Found a fix that does help but does not fully correct issue Love the water resistant feature Expandable memory is really handy as well as the USB adapter that came with the phone Phone reception is very clear and has no distortion whatsoever Camera takes clear and crisp pictures Phone performs all tasks very quickly with no visible lag Color replication on pictures is accurate and vivid Display is a very generous size and looks crisp and bright No dead pixels either This phone is a great investment I only wish it had a removable battery though that would have been the icing on the cake aha this product is slick The quality of pictures and videos it takes is beautiful It is fast and its not overwhelming on your hands like some other products I am glad I made the right choice to buy this product So far have really enjoyed this phone Great screen fast processing good stuff The Good Polished design Awesome camera Long battery life microSD storage slot and waterresistant The Bad No removable battery high cost accessories I was very impressed with my new S7 

I had one unpleasant problem though I was not able to connect my new phone to computer Now I know that youve changed USB protocol and that I have to use MTP and how to do it As it happened new USB Cable was defective took me time though to realize it It works for charging and thats it Anyway when I replaced it with the old cable all started to work

Realistically its not a big deal However attention to details is what makes a great Company rather than just a good one I love the fact they brought back the SD card but you still cant install your application on it I hope they fix that Beautiful design incredible hardware this phone is truly remarkable I have never been more impressed by a smartphone and I have owned an iPhone and a Windows Phone This phone in my opinion stands above the rest and I would recommend it to anyone looking for the highest end phone in the market right now This phone is great I love it if love the way the screen curves I love the fact its water proof too This product is very easy and convenient to useTo many options to choose from the various applications of a cellphone Thank You Samsung 
For listening to your customers and making an amazing product
Im so glad the micro sd card support is back and the waterproofing without needing to have a flap to seal out the water
Plus 4 gb of ram yes 4
its not a phone anymore its a computer power house 
Its so fast can practicaly see in the dark with its low light capabilities
The only thing thats still missing is the IR blaster i really enjoyed having it on my phone
but other than that great device One of my favorite things has to be Samsung Pay I never thought how many times I would use it and how much time it would save me at checkout The camera is another big thing for me Even with the drop in the amount of megapixels it is definitely a better camera than its predecessor The phone itself feels amazing in the hand and just is one of the most beautiful phones I have ever looked at Amazing phone Glad I bought it Makes everything so easy Ive had this phone for about a week now and have yet to run the battery down The quick charging is very fast and the screen is incredible Best Web surfing experience ever  Get It  The Galaxy S7 edge is packed with awesome features super fast bright HD screen resolution I especially like the new SD card slot feature capable of up to 200gb SD card to save files and folders Great sound quality and the battery lasts for 2 days with normal use I am just getting my phone I love Samsung products I got this phone on Wednesday and I have been loving it The camera is awesome screen is awesome most everything is pretty awesome Three days in and the lock button stopped working and the volume down button stopped working so disappointed I also had some apps on my home screen and they all disappeared Very frustrated I dont know what happened to my groups and the songs that were assigned to each group Beautiful phone with a great camera That is the only good thing I can say about it Dont listen to anyone say the battery life is great Mine loses over half the battery life within12 hours of only moderate use They say turn off your Bluetooth location sync force stop apps turn down brightness to conserve battery life What good is the phone if you have to do all that Good luck trying to find a tempered glass screen protector Even the s7 haswipe a slight curve on its edges Either the protector is too small and doesnt cover enough of the screen or its too big and didnt sit down on the edges Then you get dust and dirt build up Done with it not worth your time Very nice size screenwhile maintaining portabilityA good balance Excellent screen intensity con trast and brightness Fully functional and more Ahhhh It has everything water resistant good camera and more Quite the amazing device Never thought Samsung could impress me so much but they did it once again I am so disappointed I must have gotten a lemon The battery is really poor Ill lose 15 in an hour or moderate use 50 loss in 45 hours I know how to make sure there isnt inordinate battery drain going on so I know it is the battery

Also it just isnt that fast It isnt any faster than my Nexus 5X Am going to return The Samsung S7 is an excellent system and its actual performance is better than my original expectations The clarity of pictures is outstanding and the voice quality is noteworthy S7s quick charge is better than other cell phones on the market All around excellent performance Years ago I tried android and didnt like it I have been on Iphone for a long time But I have grown so tired of Iphone that last summer I switched to windows phone Still not what I was looking for I started looking for a good android phone so I could give them another try In my search I saw that Samsung was releasing a new Galaxy soon So as I read rumors and expected features I grew anxious Then when the announcement came and all the rumors were correct I said this is the phone for me I pre ordered my Galaxy S7 and received it before the official sale date I am super excited Ok enough on how I got to android Now about the phone 
This is the best phone I have ever held in my hands Super fast Expandable storage Large Battery Wireless Charging Water Proof Amazing Camera And able to be customized to what ever your liking is Samsung listens to what the customers want Something Apple does not do 
I have been on Android for 5 days now and I am loving it compared to IOS and windows phone If Samsung keeps putting out products like this they have a life long customer But because I love this phone so much I doubt I will be trading it in when the next galaxy comes out Ill hang on to this one for at least 2 years Besides its going to be very very hard to top the very best phone ever made 
By the way Wireless Charging is very fast I also bought the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger Well worth it I also purchased a CaseMate barely there Clear case and a tempered glass screen protector 
If any of you are IOS users or Windows phone users that are thinking of switching over to Android give the Samsung Galaxy S7 a try I am sure you will be just as pleased with it as I am 
I highly recommend this phone BUY IT The S7 is awesome I love it I even bought 2 today I really like this phone but HATE the fact that the tempered glass cover doesnt cover all of the screen Whats the point of a screen protector if it doesnt cover the whole screen No real complain wish that you could preorder an unlocked version of the phone and not have to wait until later to possibly get one also a bit expensive Ive owned a lot of different phones and I can honestly say this blows everything Ive ever come across completely out of the water Beautiful display lightweight and thin yet the phone is deceptively durable I heard rumors that the battery was outstanding and I had my doubts at first Yesterday though I took a day off from work and unplugged the S7 from my charger at 8 am I had the phone in my hands doing something the entire day whether it was online playing games or using the VR At around midnight my battery reached 8 percent and I couldnt believe that with all I had done in the day This is THE phone to have and its not over priced Trust me just go get one I already owned the Galaxy S6 but I decided to upgrade due to the water restance and expandable storeage of the Galaxy S7 So far I love the phone my only issue is that it keeps acting like the split screen button is held I am not sure if I have a bad device or if there will be a software update to address the over sensitivity Waited a long time for the upgrade to be worth the price Wish USB type C was available and not impressed by the increased battery size but hopefully Ill see improvement in the coming months Volume is excellent on this phone Also offers a magnifier Plus more great features Got it for 2 days playing around with all the setting seem easy but yet complicated since the setting can go deeper than the old phone Less useless preinstalled apps or software but it scared me a little it was missing the Music Player app and the Voice Recorder    so I go without music for couple hours next day find it in the Galaxy Essential Store the first day it cannot connect but the second day connected and found couple interesting app too 

Yes actually less preinstalled app a good thing Just for that Samsung do a good job a pad on the back 

Overall look feel and quality are great but the Sim Card slot is kind of I dont know what to say easy to take out hard to put it back in without the Sim Card moving while inserting the tray You can tell I am a old man with a shaky hand

The App Drawer I been dreaming for that for organize the mess of all the apps Grouping app is easy and make it easy for me to look for app in the App Drawer you can create grouping like a subdrawer for Google app Samsung app and Microsoft app Been trying to do it on S4 which I can only the group in same page

Speed and Camera are good as they claim I am not an expert but sure noticed it is far better than the S4 Battery for my S7 is 3000amh sure last more than 15 hours before I go to bed and I am satisfy with that 

The power saving feature look good to kind of tried it and sure it will help when I get in trouble Check out the emergency setting send SOS and I did not try it so I do not know it really work or not You can try it but dont blame me for going to jail I have always been a droid lover When I started looking into a new phone I found the S7 Edge was coming out soon I love the battery life edge panel and all around UI I love the ability to keep changing things I love the themes and I love the finger print sensor I found it useful in the S Health the pulse spo2 and stress levels Although I would love if S Health integrated with Garmin I love my Garmin I found though I am not able to connect my Garmin through Bluetooth like I have before Its requesting me to use location One other issue I have is speaker placement I find my hand covering the speaker muting it unintentionally When I have someone on speaker phone I have to hold the phone a certain way or Ill cover it up Other than those small issue I dont have anything else to complain about I think Ive become a galaxy addict This phone is absolutely beautiful its cutting edge and its sleek curved back makes it easy to hold without losing grip Plus its IP68 certified which is perfect for a rainy day or an accidental drop at the beach or lake I would recommend this phone to anyone Iphone users and older model galaxy users alike Overall I rate it 1010 definitely check out this phone Its a must buy I didnt want to upgrade until Samsung added the expandable storage option back Moved from my Note4 to the S7 Edge I love the Edge features but I dont use them as much as I hoped I would I also can NOT COMPLAIN ENOUGH about the bloatware Its becoming more and more prevelant I upgraded from the S4 well worth it this new S7 Edge is great Ive had for 3 days now and it has lived up to all the reviews and then some that I watched on You Tube I love the size fits my hand perfectly and I am still discovering all the new features I used the Samsung pay a few times no problems everything worked the way it was supposed to Love this phoneonly wish is it being offered in white I am in love with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Its packed full of amazing features The battery life is insane Im a heavy user so battery life is a huge deal Its got a gorgeous display Call and other sound quality is great Its easy to navigate Performance is very responsive and quick I could go on Its a phone I highly recommend I like it that its waterproof but the issue of getting hot in the pocket after a missed call is the same as S6 and other galaxy issues Fluid fast beautiful pictures 1080p 60fps 40k videos The list goes Best phone on the market Look at the specs Also comes with great apps made by and for Samsung just check out c nets review This is the best android phone ever Smooth slim and powerful Much faster smoother we will never veer from Samsung but the 7 is outstanding Much better quality Great design for everyone Sleek colors are great for everybody Wonderful vibrant colors Only 32GB internal memory not enough Not all apps are movable to SDcard Unfortunately Samsung is choosing not to offer this phone is the USA with 64GB or more internal memory like its competitors Why Also one of the single absolute best features for the new Marshmallow OS is Adoptable Storage Marshmallow OS offers the option to treat the memory card storage as internal storage memory WOW What an ingenious awesome feature Not Samsung and LG have both decided to disable this feature in Marshmallow OS If not disabled it would be possible to have up to 32GB plus 200GB SDcard for a net of 232GB of internal memory via the Adoptable Storage feature within Marshmallows OS unfortunately not for this phone I am now encouraged to find the Marshmallow OS phone whos mfg has not disabled this feature Sorry S7 not for me I love it is the best phone on the world ill never use iphone again Compared to the iPhone it has way more features and really easy to setup everything up By far the easiest processtransfer to a new phone I ever made Having for only a few hours and Im in love  Samsung is my electronics go to this phone should be the phone of the year hands down just got this phone couple days agoand I love this phone its awesomeThank you samsung Great phone easy to use Features are great battery life is not bad this is the best phone I have ever owned it is perfect If you skipped the s6 or the note5 last year the s7 takes the best of those versions and improves upon them To me this is almost a perfect phone thought mine does tend to run a bit hot I love the SideSync So much easier than the phone I did have As a matter of fact I have never owned a Samsung product I have no regrets purchasing this Samsung phone Have only had it one day but already am enjoying new features and speed Sleek design and excellent camera Excited to learn more about this new phone from Samsung I love it very nice up to date phone I would buy it again for a friendnothing like it This device brought me back to Samsung Great job The camera is awesome so clear and crisp It takes an SD card Amazing I preordered the S7 and received a Gear VR headset along with it My previous phone was a Galaxy S4 and I am extremely pleased with the improvements made since the S4 ms initial release I highly recommend the S7 I just upgraded from a Galaxy Note 3 which I also loved to an S7 Edge There is just so much new function in this phone Ive had it for 2 days and am still exploring You can of course read all about it on the web because its really too much to get into the full details here I will however hit just a few of the main features I like

The main new feature is the Edge function You can just swipe from the top right to left and reveal frequently used apps then task shortcuts create contact take selfie etc people and news All of this is programmable to add or delete just about anything youd like from each Edge menu Its extremely handy

The display Super AMOLED protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 2560 x 1440 pixels with a 640dpi resolution It really pops super clear Its also extremely responsive to the touch even with a Zagg screen protector applied

Its water resistant to 3 meters but not waterproof Nonetheless I guess I dont have to worry about dropping my phone into the toilet anymore 

Battery life is excellent I personally get about 1015 hours depending on what Im doing It also charges very quickly from nearly dead to a full charge in a little over an hour It can also be charged wirelessly but I havent bought that charger yet so I really cant comment on the performance there

This might sound trivial but one new feature I really like in particular is the ability to unlock the phone using my fingerprint You can even register multiple fingers I use my forefinger and thumb Seems really secure as well Ive had several people try their fingerprints and the phone rejected all of them Fast access and awesome

Samsung has really hit it out of the park this time by far the best phone Ive ever owned I love this phone Sleek design feels nice and the camera is fantastic Good phone worth the purchase This is my third Galaxy I probaby love it so much because of the familiarity My new Galaxy7 has great battery life It comes with a USB adapter to directly connect it to your old phone and transfer your photos contacts etc The speedy charger that comes with it is awesome  Im looking forward to using the cordless charging feature as well The download speeds are impressive I love the always on display option and the ability to turn it off when desired There are so many features I still have to explore Overall the Samsung Galaxies have been great phones for me can t imagine upgrading to anything else This is my 6th Samsung phone  I love it  I like that is a little slimmer than my s5 Its very sleek and feels great in my hand The camera is awesome Ive only had it a few days but I could list a ton of reasons I love this phone I love what I had with my Samsung S5 Now I have what I love even more with my Samsung S7 I really like how they kept the phone book the same I also am enjoying the faster processor The Android system is still so user friendly Oh I forgot the most important thing its got the 32GB for internal memory unlike my S5 Samsung has delivered yet another fantastic product that leads the way in smartphones The sleek design with great features makes you never want to put the phone down The galaxies keep on giving at get by every year Keep it up Samsung you have a loyal customer in this guy Upgrading from a S4 to a S7 is a big difference The fact that the micro SD card slot has returned made this device even more enticing to purchase This is the first time Ive used an android phone I have to say its fun and fast I really love the design of the device inside and out Super excited about this product Thank you samsung I love the new features of my Galaxy S7
Pictures turn out great and I am so happy they put the expansion card feature back in This phone is absolutely amazing Its blazing fast very nice looking and it feels so good The only thing that I can say that I dont like about it is that the fingerprint scanner isnt completely accurate 100 of the time but nothing really is I love everything about Samsung Galaxy s7 edge Really like the fast charging and wireless charging plus being able to pair with other samsung Just got the galaxy s7 edge and so far so good I like the screen size the sleek design and the pictures and color quality is amazing It did take a much longer time to fully charged Cant wait to explore more I had a Samsung Galaxy from the first one and just recently traded the S4 in for the S7 Edge So the product is well worth the cost I look forward to discovering all the features that the S7 Edge offers over the next couple of years I would say I upgrade my phone every two 2 to three 3 years

I recommend this product to anybody who is eligible for an upgrade Everything about the Galaxy 7 is phenominal Many new feautures like waterresistance makes it ideal for outdoors I just switched from Windows which I have used forever I I was very skeptical about switching but I am so glad I did I absolutely love this phone and the OS The Galaxy S7 is a great phone I love it I recommend anyone to get one Love love love this phone The design is super sweet Awesome great phone big screen good camera easy to use Still trying w figure it all out but like all the features Camera is amazing Screen is amazing Very fast Definitely worth it Really liked how easy it was to swap out phones  Definitely liking the SD card unlike the S6  Still trying to figure this thing out  This has to be the best phone out yet For my type of work with emails everyday Google Calendar does everything I needed to do and more Love my new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge the camera takes awesome photos and the screen is very crisp I used to have a Samsung phone however I listened to a friend and purchased a iPhone Sorry didnt know what I was thinking Was in the store looking at phones and by far this is the one that stood out not only looks but also performance over a great phone and am glad to have it Works great awesome phone cant wait to install some memory in it I really like this phone more than s6 it really improve a lot Just received phone looks and feels just right Best phone I have had yet ready to learn Beautiful design water proof is a great feature love the way the screen is set up
Love everything This phone is a must for people who want a user friendly phone it is easy to use and has bigger app icons then previous phones and also is lighter and sleeker then others it runs fast has a great camera On top of it all the phone is water resistant which is a plus in my book Ive owned the galaxy s7 edge for about 7 hours now its fast great for multitasking and as far as hardware is concerned its by far the best looking phone Ive ever seen The S7 Edge is incomparable Impeccable styling and materials incredibly useful built in features including the edge menu waterproofing expandable memory and a massive battery Again it is incomparable phone is amazing definitely a huge step up from the s6 Upgraded from a S5 to the new Galaxy S7 Edge so far everything has run smoothly from the transfer of data from my old phone into the S7 Im enjoying the screen that is just beautiful and easier on my eyes I also purchased the rapid wireless charger that is great No more plugging in the phone and having the micro port get damaged like on my old phone The phone looks and feels great The fingerprint scanner has come a long way it works on the first swipe so far I know its day 1 but so far Im happy with my purchase Batterydevice defective Went with a droid turbo 2 Per Samsung they dont require screen protectors and ironically none fit including zag and Verizons I just got a new phone and I love it It is very easy to use and I love the water resistant feature It was very easy to transfer all of my stuff from my old phone with the steps it gave Awesome phone This phone has so many great features even my teen couldnt wait to try it out I myself cant get past the awesomeness of the camera I love love love the fact that it will connect my selfies battery life to this point is great  have high hopes The S7 is sleek fast intuitive to use and has a fast and easy set up It feels sturdy resistant to water and its just so pretty Well worth the investment Love the look of the phone and it is very fast but Ive already had issues with it force closing my apps turning off by itself it turned on by self as well after but very inconvenient  I do love the samsung health app that was aleady installed on the phone Battery life is not impressive at all dies very quickly and I really dont use it constantly or enough for it to reach that point so Im disappointed  Two things i like about the productexpandable memory and water resistant rest are good too but this makes product extra ordinary then others I love the speed of this phone screen is crystal clear LOVE IT will update later after a week of use I love this phone Ive had several smartphones and this has been the best one yet Samsung got it right on this one I just got my S7 from preorder today Going from a Galaxy S3 to this S7 is amazing The display is fantastic and the battery is huge Definitely glad I waited for the S7 to come out Get ready to be in awe of the new galaxy S best purchase ever SO FAR IS DOING WHAT I SAW ON TV AND YOUTUBE IN REAL LIFE VERY USEFULL I upgraded to the S7 from an LG G2 I was looking to get a phone that would perform better in some areas that my LG was weak in namely battery life charging speed lag time and camera quality I am so pleased I decided on the Galaxy S7 It charges very quickly and so far the battery lasts a long time and I use my phone quite a bit It doesnt lag at all and is very fast The camera is awesome I dont notice much of a difference from my LG with the front facing camera but the rear facing one is amazing No lag time when taking pictures either The Always on display is a neat feature and it doesnt seem to be affecting battery life yet but I will be turning it off if it starts

The one thing I do find rather annoying is the fingerprints I got the gold phone and wow does it show fingerprints I have a case on it so its not an issue but I feel like I could never display it without the case The fingerprints make it look terrible

Overall this is a great phone I am very happy so far I cannot believe how much more streamlined this phone is compared to my Galaxy 5 The charging system is amazing since the S1 Ive been a huge Samsung fan This blows them all the way My significant other has been set on the Iphone  Mac for life until I setup my new S7 and played around with it Shes trading in her Iphone 6S today for the S7 Edge I really enjoy this phone and the features Its lightweight so it doesnt feel like Im holding a brick to my head 
If I could ask for one change though it would be to bring back the kids mode so my little ones can safely use my phone without wandering and changing my phone settings and languages Please Please bring the kids mode back best phone to date by samsung yet which is as expected have had most galaxy s phones and they have all been good had the iphone once and switched to samsung and never looked back I have previously had the Galaxy S4 S5  S6 The new S7 is faster for browsing and changing apps it charges quicker and holds a charge longer the camera is second to none and it is slimmer I give Samsung 5 stars for everything on this phone So this is my first newn release phone Off my bucket list Water proof is what I been waiting for lets see howit holds up for a working man So far this phone is so easy to use I love using it Didnt jump on the s5 or s6 but as soon as they previewed the s7 I knew that was my next new phone Was seriously contemplating ios because of the lollipop update that was forced upon the s4 which has destroyed the phone altogether Hopefully android doesnt force another worthless update The colors pop and the themes make the customization fun and easy The AOD is a nice feature and it doesnt kill the battery 
The curved back of the phone makes operation easy along with the slightly curved front not as dramatic as the edge
Quick agile and smooth operation Battery lasts for whole day with regular use and if used heavily itll charge extremely fast with the fast charge
Great phone so far I received my product just yesterday and I have already played with it for hours upon hours since then Thats just a warning that this review is based off of all the initial feelings that floodin with getting a new gadget aka toy 

This phone is amazing I upgraded from a note 4 so already being familiar with android was a big plus for me It gave me time to focus on the phones edge bar of awesomeness Being able to set up an even quicker access to frequently used apps has been pretty helpful The phone also has a nice number of options to customize the bar Ive gone through it to some extent and am looking forward to using it to its fullest potential

Physically the phone is pretty slick I mean this both figuratively and literally it has already slipped out of my hands onceprompting me to purchase a case Other than that its beautiful It is noticeably smaller than the note 4 but Im loving the smoothness the curves the titanium its just so cool looking 

The camera Most photos Ive taken thus far were in lowlight I think the phones new feature of being able to satisfy the low light photographers out there was meant more for amateur photographers YES there is a big difference between taking that same picture with another android the note 4 for example but I think I personally expected a little more than I should have In general the camera is still pretty awesome 

The battery It definitely has a longer battery life than my last android of course my exphone had been acting up battery wise so it may not be the best to compare this one to Its fast charge feature is extremely helpful especially when nonstop fiddling with the phone is occurring I did notice the phone started heating up after a little while about a solid hour of use Granted I was doing a ton of stuff on the phone and not just having it sit there After just a few minutes of giving it a rest it cooled down 

Okay well I only wanted to say a few words that blew up to quite a few more thanks to excitement To be honest as of now I truly would give this phone a 45 star rating I cannot in good conscious give it a 5 since I have not even had the phone for an entire day 

Enjoy the phone to those planning on making the purchase

Ps I gave a 4 on value just because I generally dont like having to spend so much money on phones I do not like changing phones Learning new technology is difficult for me I have enjoyed the ease with which I have transferred information and quickly began use of the new phone If I wouldve wanted an iPhone I wouldve bought it The s7 is way to much like an iPhone I HATE IT I loved my s5 it had the toolbox and was big and great NOT HAPPY Thought the s7 was the biggest and greatest phone ever NOT Love SAMSUNG but not the s7 This is my first Android and Samsung Phone EVER Im so glad and proud to be a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge owner The new black color doesnt look dark blue like the previous models slimmer and could add more memory Just switched from my iPhone to my very first Android Id say this device kicks the heck out of my iPhones Really excited about this phonew Samsung pay the camera the SD card the VR the water resistance the battery life the screen sizethe list goes on and on Seriously awesome job Samsung everything seems good so far just got it today Only negative things with out a case the phone is too slick some texture on the back or sides to give a little friction would be better to make it less likely to slip from your grip Everything else I love and seems to work great This phone is beautiful and very nice compared to my note 4 I just upgraded from but I assumed this was going to be biggerthis is perfect for a person who doesnt like the larger phones I love the fact that I can connect my other devices directly to the phone I must say this is a perfectly sized phone with absolutely all the features the S6 lacked and even more I will be using this phone on my daily workouts so the waterproof feature will be very useful I can also fit this phone perfectly in my purse or jeans pocket with ease I love that they brought the expandable storage back as I love music and I also love to read ebooks and I was really weary about the onboard 32 gb storageThe color is gorgeousThe black onyx is a deep rich black This phone is very responsive and super fastI am still getting acquainted with my new phone but I must say I am so far loving it I am still trying to get used to the speed of the new S7 Im glad I waited to upgrade love everything about it the galaxy s7 edge love it the best phone on the market I love this phone because it is water proof and fast I bought this phone to replace my Galaxy Note Edge and am very happy with it so far The performance and features are unmatched in any phone I have ever had The galaxy 7s edge is a great product It has great features and the performance is outstanding Looks and feels amazing edge panels are getting more capable mostly amazing performance Its waterproof 
The best phone thanks samsung I love the look of it The camera is amazing My first edge not use to the curved screen Keep accidently touching the side and opening different screens But overall Im loving it This phone has exceeded my expectations so far I wish that had brought back the ability to remove and replace the battery too Ive had this phone for a little while and I love it so far  it is neat and slick I thought my last Samsung phone was awesome This one is by far the best phone I have ever had Lovelovelove it Couldnt believe that they could update the galaxy phone any further but Samsung never stops surprising me Performance of this phone is amazing and would 100 recommend for purchase Love the large clear screen how fast the auto focus works on the camera and its waterproof I have only had the phone for 1 day now but i love it It is so fast and clear The camera is fanatic It takes great pictures Over all I love this phone and this everyone should get it I use my phone for a variety of things but the processing speed is second to none I can zip through the games I use and still have a ton of functionality left over I have used Samsung devices for more than five years And compared to other devices Ive it tops them all I purchased this phone for my son and he loves it so much It has big screen but keeps a small size very smooth interface good battery waterproof is a great feature for kids Highly recommended This phone really took it to the next level To me its not just a phone its also a computer I can do everything I need to do on the go right from my device Sometimes I use my galaxy S7 instead of my computer to get things done even when Im at home I recommenced this product to anyone who is looking for a phone thats not only exciting but the new landmark of current technology in my opinion I already have a few friends just waiting to buy it Awesome product Thanks Samsung Such a beautiful phone with an amazing camera Glad I waited and upgraded from my galaxy s5 The other one is still in top shape so I know this one will last Favorite phone And the VR is such a cool bonus Glad I preordered The phone is absolutely great in every way except for one No matter what your front facing camera will have the Beauty Face setting automatically on with absolutely NO WAY of turning it off Please for the love of all things Samsung LET US TURN THIS OFF I dont want any autoairbrushing done to my photos It serves no purpose I mean you put little sliders on each filter but even if they are set to 0 they still filter That makes no sense If you let us turn that feature off and have a plain frontfacing camera mode then this phone would be hands down perfect in every way S7 Edge has exceeded my expectations in every way By far the best I have ever seen Im sure I cant do any better than all the professional review web sites so Ill just mention my likes I like the the feel of it in my hand the always on display and the fact that its water and dust resistant I opened the box on 9 March at around 4 pm Set up was straight forward as any smart phone is these days Within an hour I was getting random restarts from the S7 Decided to wait till today to try a factory reset 
 I reset the phone this morning at 0800 Since then I have had three random self reboots I have tried a few suggestions from the online community as the S6 had a known random reboot problem as well So far nothing has worked 
 I will be returning the phone today as it is obviously defective I do NOT recommend this phone based on my experience with it I upgraded to this device from the s4 because I wasnt ready to give up my microsd slot I am sooooo happy they brought that back This phone is amazing the graphics are next level its so easy to use and just flat out amazing I just got it yesterday and thus far I am very very pleased The only thing Im not too crazy about is the front facing camera The camera use a default beauty filter which enhances your photo and Im not crazy about that Id prefer the photo to look more natural like the Iphone 6S This new smart phone is fast beautiful and works great The high definition screen is crystal clear and responds really well to the swipes and taps Just recently got this phone as a gift and I love it already The design is sleek and beautiful and the gold platinum is really cool and modern Easy to navigate so far and look forward to learning more about this phone Battery life is nuts The 55 display rocks
This phone is easy to use and so fun to have
Thank you Samsung I am telling all my friends who arent already ordering or using the 7 edge at every chance I get to I am absolutely a Samsung Galaxy Note girl all day long but once I saw all the awesome features packed into the Samsung Galaxy S7 I promptly placed my preorder I love my platinum gold Note 5 but I must say that I am extremely impressed by just how well Samsung listened to what the consumer wanted and they delivered This will be my phone when I work out so the screen size is perfect The waterproof feature is a definite plus The subtle curve on the back of the phone makes this phone fit my hand like a glove I definitely recommend this phone I will be putting this phone through the paces until the Samsung Galaxy Note 6 makes its highly anticipated debut I just upgraded from galaxy S5 to the new S7 today and let me tell you it is awesome slimmer than S5 charges without plugging in  they moved the speaker to the bottom corner along with the headphone jack to the opposite bottom corner great phone I have only had the S7 Edge for a few days but couldnt be happier I have always be a Samsung person and always will be I love that they brought back the expandable memory back Thanks Samsung Light weight nice screen appearance easy to use had several s series and have been very good phones Dang everything except for the fact that I have to remove in app full of apps screen just to access the grid size and widgets etc un like on my note 5 where I just hold the screen between the bottom primary apps and the main apps you know where the screen number bar is The phone is great Holds a charge and charges fast It is kinda of pricy but for the quality it is good I love the design it and has an amazing camera the best phone I liked it because I can get into the water and takes great pictures everything is excellent I replaced my Samsung Note 3 with this phone as I wanted something a little smaller Setup was a breeze I used Quick Connect to transfer everything from the Note 3 to the S7 The phone is super fast and the screen is amazing I havent given the camera much of a workout yet I am SO glad that I preordered and that it showed up today

The ONLY thing that Im not liking for accessories is that the glass protectors that Ive come across will only fit the flat part of the screen so its about 18 from the edge of the phone not even covering all of the viewable screen I am completely in love with this new Galaxy S7 Edge I have had the S4 S5 and now the New S7 Edge and I am blown away with each new addition that comes out The most impressive feature is the camera It takes absurdly crisp clear detailed photos So impressive Great phone I love it so far wish it had more apps available for it  Love love love this phone The pictures are amazing and look as though I used a professional camera Its super fast and the hands free option is great while driving Definitely worth the money and wait Best phone Ive had All the features on the phone are easy to use and customizable I have really enjoyed this phone so far The best smart phone in the market in this moment waoo prefect finished good quality highly recommend I just picked this up yesterday from my local BB store I purchased the Gold Platinum phone and it is a beautiful piece of equipment Got most of my apps contacts etc put on it Easy to do and no real issues doing it Love how slim it is and almost hate to put a phone case on it While I have only had it for 24 hours I can already tell Im going to love it My no longer have any need for my PC The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a fantastic phone Right out of the box you think Wow this is an incredibly light and good looking phone Smile wise consumer this is YOUR incredibly light and good looking phone This feeling continues as you turn on the phone and the vibrant screen greets its new owner Setup was a breeze and the super convenient Samsung Smart Switch app made it really easy to move everything from my old phone You need to download Samsung Smart Switch on your old not incredibly light or good looking phone from whatever app store you may use This was not available for my phone the One Plus Two I was able to side load the app by downloading the APK and installing it manually

Touch Wiz continues to be refined into a smoother and better experience though I wish I could remove some apps For example I love Googles calendar app especially the widget You cant remove or even disable the Samsung calendar app I just get the pleasure of having two calendar apps There are worse problems to have The edge tools are neat but I dont think Ill be using them often The fingerprint reader is zippy and accurate 

I play a lot of games on my phone And were not talking crushing candy here Games that chew through batteries and make the screen red hot with processing power Thats a thing right Anyway this phone holds up Super powerful the battery holds up and the phone doesnt feel like Im resting my hands on a hot stove But the phone does this thing And I dont like this thing The phone is under the impression that I want to play my games with a super vibrant super saturated color scheme I dont At all Its making my games look awful Samsung I beg of you add the option to keep the current color profile while playing games Basic mode is perfect please let me play my games Basic mode

Buy this phone You wont be disappointed You know what is disappointing Your current phone Your current miserably heavy incredibly ugly phone I have had an iPhone since the 3GS model This is the first phone that has had me even think about switching from an iPhone I love the new Samsung S7 Edge so far Would recommend to anyone I am so happy with this phone Hands down the best Beautiful in form
Beautiful in function
I bought this as a gift for my daughter who previously got the handmedowns 
Not this time  I love the newer design and how it sits in my hands Pretty fresh in my opinion just upgraded to this from the galaxy 4 and Im impressed so far A little heavy in the pocket at times but I actually like that Honestly I havent messed around with the product but everything was easy to be transferred overall from my old one to my new one So far everything is going as expected I would suggest if you have the galaxy s5 go get the new galaxy s7 because its better  Battery still issue that its built in not removable Well I have only had it for two nights I find the design easy to hold The screen is simply amazing The new features are fun And I cant wait to learn the device more so that I can update my review absolutely love that water resistence is back love that it is just like my s5 but better in all ways but only 1 no IR I loved using my phone as remote however losing this one feature is not make or break just a pain to get used to A colosal step up from an iPhone From the moment I opened the nicely designed box I was hooked The phones initial setup is very intuitive and just the feel of this phone on my hand is just right The flexibility of the things that can be done with this phones features and its design simply blow my mind no wallpaper carouselwraparound
home screen does not rotate

Still exploring the device Hopefully the simple items above are addressed Came back to Samsung after last product was the S2 amazing device fast no lag no stutter Improved major features from previous devices iphone killer  I love everything about this phone thus far I am a big and great fan of Samsung products and will retire with them Keep up the great work and I will forever be your number one fan and will stick with Android and the Samsung Galaxy family The phone also works great with my S gear too I love this new phone Very user friendly and easy to set up Went from a LgG3 to this phone Love the camera Great photos Speakers sound great Would recommend to anyone I purchased this to replace my iPhone 6s Ive been playing around with the settings and customizing the phone to my preferences with ease Its very intuitive speedy and feels good to hold I love the features especially the always on screen that lets me check the date and time at a glance without turning my phone on 

The size is perfect Not too big not too small Great for my poor vision and such a crisp display The fingerprint setup was fun and the added security is awesome The low light camera is better than I was expecting and a large factor in my choosing this model Im ecstatic about this purchase and have no negatives to report I would write more but Id rather get back to playing with my new phone I have been a true believer in Samsung products due to fact that I work out doors
I have lived in Texas all my life and the weather here changes in a heartbeat
You can have all four seasons within a week
My phone has taken a licking and keeps on ticking
Sincerely
A True Believer Coming from the Note 5 I can say that this phone is a lot better I have just spent a few hours with it and I love all the features Its easier to operate and faster And the camera  The Note 5 has an excellent camera but this one is superb  Congrats Samsung for a great product  Really love the phone just one downside I loved the IR port on my S4 Active and up until the S6 they had them but the S7 got rid of it unfortunately that is the only reason i cant give it 5 stars for everything Just received the S7 and loving it so far I have had the S4 active for some time now and loved it Phone is faster then my s6 edge Plus doesnt over heat with gear vr like the s6 did Upgraded  switched from S4 WOW  What a difference The display is phenomenal its crazy fast and transferring was super easy thanks to the new tool I love the style of it And I havent have any problems so far So Yay Im so glad I did the upgrade from a Samsung Galaxy s5 to the new Samsung Galaxy s7 edge Love the new features and cant wait too find out what else it can do 1st timer user of Samsung it feels great so happy Everything about this phone is great Love the features Works great on the gear vr Cant wait to test out the camera and everything else it has to offer Thank you for making this great phone The only con I can think of is I wish it was available in blue like a sapphire blue The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has far exceeded my expectations for a smart phone From the amazing camera being able to shoot in 4K to the super fast processor to the awesome Edge functionality This phone definitely has it all This phone is the perfect size and it feels amazing in the hand The screen is brilliant audio quality is crisp and clear and performance is untouchable Great job Samsung So far Ive had only two days with the new galaxy s7 edge and I love it Ive had an IPhone for the last 8 years and I dont miss it It is different and I will say there is pros to both The phone it self has a beautiful design And I love all the features that come with it Glitches in touch screen messes up when Im trying to open stuff or when I want to fight in windows And I miss the same pen Typing is difficult on the edges Having the galaxy s6 and now the galaxy s7 is not much of a difference but the little that did change is enough to notice the difference in between the two of them Nice sleek design and great features The pictures are beautiful Better faster  stronger  I wouldnt buy anything less I LOVE THIS PHONE Price is high but you get what you pay for Its expected from the flagship phone companies 

The phone looks great and feels great Super fast I upgraded from an S5 and Im excited they brought back the expandable storage Thats what kept me away from the S6 

I brought it over to my girlfriends and she thought it was ridiculous that I spent so much on a phone I shelled out the extra money for the edge But I let her play with it and run it under the sink and she wants one now 
Great product Impressed overall Definitely recommend I love the clear screen The ease of transferring my informationapps and other data with the transfer attachment is a plus no more long hours at the store  Great A My S7 Edge is AWESOME Cant wait to use the new camera features I just bought my new Galaxy S7 edge This had to be one of the easiest phones to activate and start using This phone is very easy to understand and the features are great Smooth sexy and fast everything I wanted what more could I ask for Ivery had an iPhone since they came out and I just switched to Samsung I love it and I am so glad I did it Pictures are unbelievable 
Design and color unimaginable Gold
Just love it Big phone with big case I hav use this for a month and Im impressive with the duality of this phone base in this performance theres no big phone yet that is in the world only gold and black wheres the white version come on guys I love Samsung and how smart it is and it just has cool phones I do not believe that such a thing can existits highly valuable and greatly designednot only view but also the hardwarefeatures are wisely chosen and give the best experience to the userI am sure it would be an other great victory for the Samsung
currently I am using note 4 and it works efficiently for me but i temped to buy this product because of great facilities that it gave to the user
finally i should say that i am waiting for this and counting seconds until times reach
