Parking Violation Project:

This is map-reducing counting project for parking Violation data from fiscal year 2020.

This folder includes four subfolders and each represents our solution for the questions. Each of the subfolders contains mapper.py, combiner.py, reducer.py, and test.sh.

This folder also includes the reduced data set that we used for testing and the start.sh and stop.sh files. 

The file can be tested by going to one of the subfolders and then run “bash test.sh”

Question 1 is ‘When are the tickets most likely to be issued’. The map and reduce solution can be found under the subfile question1.

Question 2 is ‘What is the most common years and types of cars to be ticketed?’. The map and reduce solution can be found under the subfile question2.

Question 3 is ‘Where are tickets most likely issued?’. The map and reduce solution can be found under the subfile question3.

Question 4 is ‘Which color of vehicle is most likely to get a ticket?’ The map and reduce solution can be found under the subfile question4.
