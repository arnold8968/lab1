NBA Shots Project:

This is map-reducing counting and k-means project for NBA shot logs.

This folder includes two subfolders and each represents our solution for the questions. 

The subfolder question1 contains 2 mapper files, 2 reducer files, and test.sh file.

The subfolder question2 contains a python file to run locally and can be used to find the comfortable zones based on the user you specify in the file.

This folder also includes the start.sh and stop.sh files needed for hdfs. 

To test question1, go to its subfolder and then run “bash test.sh”. To test question3, run the python file locally in your terminal.

Question 1 asks us to solve each player’s most unwanted defender. The solution can be found under the subfile question1.

Question 2 asks us to solve a given player’s best zone for shooting. The solution can be found under the subfile question2.
