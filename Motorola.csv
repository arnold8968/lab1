Motorola Moto Z Droid,214868651,"Great Concept, Very Poor Execution",2019-11-30T07:08:25.000+00:00,1,"Hot swap moto mods are fantastic, need more choices. Size and function options of the Moto Z are great. The first year everything runs smoothly, fast, great battery life....then it changes. Battery life drains away to the point where I must leave it on charge most of the time. The phone randomly gets very hot. Bluetooth connection drops. Cannot find wifi routers though there are multiple available, ones that the phone had connected to before. Then there's the perpetual rebooting. I actually had to reset the phone back to factory, twice. Now is slow and battery life is minimal. The camera was great to start with, now it drags to open and focus; by then, the great shot you shook your phone for has gone. Oh and no upgrade to Pie available. I wish the execution lived up to the concept. Very disappointed."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,211205536,Moto Z play turn off suddenly,2019-07-14T01:01:27.000+00:00,1,"my phone suddenly turns off with the battery charged. when I want to turn it on, it is 3% charged. It is impossible to believe that. I connect it to the charger and 80% on the screen. okay I unplug it and do not spend even 20 minutes and it turns off again.
This is a martyrdom for me. I feel cheated by you. my motoz play phone started to suddenly turn off when the battery was charged. I can not work because I make a call and it turns off, I open an application and it turns off and it only stays on having it connected to the charger. This product is defective.
I followed step by step all the solutions and I can not find a way to make this, I tried all the tips and there is no solution, there is no solution.
You want to give life to a phone with an operating system that has two years of life? ...... in that way then we should buy a new phone?
Is that what it is about?
I've had motorola for almost 20 years I've grown up with each model and I feel like I will not buy another motorola because I'm very disappointed."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,187359273,Just paid off and dies every few hours,2019-05-02T19:47:45.000+00:00,1,"The internet is full of customers that own these phones and when the updates happen the battery will not stay charged. The interesting thing is, I didn't have any problems with any of the updates until after the phone was paid off.
I believe this is a ploy to force people to upgrade. I will never buy a Moto or anything produced by Levono again."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208814238,battery is awful,2019-04-29T17:59:34.000+00:00,1,I have had mine 8 months.  Love the phone but now i can't use my phone unless it is plugged in.  The battery mod won't keep it charged either.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208662956,battery issues!! ugh,2019-04-24T04:49:25.000+00:00,1,"Purchased Moto Z 2 years ago at full price. After 1 1/2 years the phone started with battery issues. It would shut down when I tried to take a picture when the battery was 80%. When the phone would power back on, it would show a low battery of around 10%. At first I thought it was a camera issue. But battery went downhill from there. A few weeks later, the battery was so bad that I needed to keep it connected to a portable power bank at all times! Now I have to tote around this phone with a power bank connected to it. The second I unplug the phone from the power bank, phone shuts off. Same when I connect phone to turbo charger (the second I unplug the phone from charger, it shuts off). This is unacceptable and I will never buy or recommend a Moto phone again."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,186893077,Horroble Battery,2019-04-18T14:19:26.000+00:00,1,I bought this phone less than 2 years ago. I now have problems with its battery. It would shut down erratically. Sometimes it would shut down when the battery is at 35% or the other times when it is 20%. I took it for repair. three times they changed the battery but now it doesn't charge. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208322266,Horrible Battery life,2019-04-11T04:34:07.000+00:00,1,I bought this phone last year and after a year using it i have notice that the battery drained fast. I have to charge my phone all the time for me to be able to use it otherwise its unusable at all. I did factory reset on this phone but still same thing.  Battery sucks
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208306043,Battery Life Issues,2019-04-10T16:29:27.000+00:00,2,"So far I've loved my Moto Z even though I've had a few problems, but the battery issue is NO LONGER tolerable. The phone has to be charged 3 or 4 times a day and its driving me crazy. It will completely cut off with 35% battery remaining. Some times it says its charging, but when I look at the battery details under settings it says ""not charging"" (which requires an unplug and re-plug). The charger isn't the problem as I have 3 different chargers and the same thing happens with all of them. These are genuine Motorola chargers, not aftermarket junk. There are no mods on my phone. Not a terrible number of aps. All pictures are backed up and cleared off frequently. Cache is cleared regularly. 

Original phone ""purchased"" Nov 2016
RIP Phone 1- Dec 2016 (brand new) - Bluetooth was broken (couldn't be repaired). 
               *Was issued a refurbished phone as a replacement even though I was 
                 still paying for brand new device
RIP Phone 2 - March 2017  - Phone started smoking when I plugged it in to charge. 
RIP Phone 3 - March 2018 - Phone started randomly rebooting. 
Phone 4 - My current phone and the battery has been an issue for about 3 months now."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208181145,Battery died after less then a year,2019-04-06T03:01:03.000+00:00,1,Battery died with less than a year I was lucky they sent a new one.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208134392,30 hour battery is a WHOLE LIE,2019-04-04T06:26:19.000+00:00,1,My six year old phone works better than this phone.  My eleven year old phone works better than this phone.  There were no problems until that one update and yall can't be bothered to fix it?  Waste.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,208125836,Battery Sucks,2019-04-03T23:05:00.000+00:00,2,"I use this phone for business, so it is more than just an inconvenience when the battery dies with no warning.  It will tell me I have 64%, but then I go to open a window or take a picture, and it just turns off.  Plug it in, says it has 35%, so turn it back on and it dies again.  Would love to have Motorola contact me about this."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207818472,Batery life problem,2019-03-23T00:07:50.000+00:00,1,"As with many others I had thoroughly enjoyed this phone with the moto mods and the long battery life and turbo charging; but then after about a year of use, I had the same issue as has been reported: wouldn't hold a charge consistently.  It's especially a problem because with the investment in moto-mods I had expected to use this phone for longer than a normal phone"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207714415,Battery problems,2019-03-18T17:48:07.000+00:00,2,I have had my phone for a year or two now. It was a great phone but now even at 80% it will randomly shut off. When I try to turn it back on it'll just shut off again or show it's at 0% and not turn on until I put it on the charger. Mine got stuck in an infinite loop of trying to turn on get to the blue screen with the red M then shut off and try again. I did a factory reset on it and it didn't help the situation at all. I won't be buying another Motorola product after this fiasco.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207386453,Don't Buy This Phone,2019-03-03T23:33:06.000+00:00,1,Battery dies after a few months. Even after the battery is replaced with the OEM part it died after 2 weeks again!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207239775,stay away from this phone,2019-02-25T16:38:14.000+00:00,1,"battery does not work at all, has to be plugged all the time, volume buttons do not work after 8 months"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207128522,Battery problems!,2019-02-20T17:13:10.000+00:00,1,"Battery drains rapidly from 100% to 60-70% then goes to 0% in seconds since software update.  Motorola aware of the issue, but not addressing.

Positively ridiculous."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,207044738,Zero battery life.,2019-02-17T03:25:54.000+00:00,1,"Once you download Android 8.0 on this phone, you will only be able to use it while plugged into the wall. The battery life goes from 100 to 0 before I can even switch from home charger to car charger. I just bought it last Xmas, now I have to get a new one."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,206844016,Great Phone First Year,2019-02-09T18:39:14.000+00:00,1,"First Year work perfect Camera Battery Life, After a Year issues started I did system update battery life dead, when a have 50% battery and take a picture phone shout down and battery drain from 50% to 3% first when I bought thought Moto z was 
 one of the best phone for my. but now I don't spend none on motorola products any more....."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,206747395,Best phone ever,2019-02-06T01:52:28.000+00:00,5,"It's a great phone , battery lastest forever. But I would the screen to be bigger ."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,184580236,"Great phone initially, battery problems and replacement phone problems later on",2019-01-03T19:37:49.000+00:00,2,"Wife and I both bought Moto Z Droid phones 2 years ago to replace our Samsung S4's.  We liked the unique features of this phone and it was easy to use.

However, about 1 year into our 2 year contract, my wife's phone's battery degraded and the phone started acting strange.  Acting strange meaning the phone would report the battery percentage as falling rapidly, the phone would spontaneously reboot and the battery percentage would gap down after reboot, for e.g. from 50 percent to 2 percent.  Then the phone would just die.
She got a replacement phone under the protection plan, but the replacement phone's bluetooth didn't work, hence a 2nd replacement phone - which worked.

I use my phone less than her, now after 2 years it's starting to have the ""gap down"" battery issue my wife's previous phone had, so it's basically on its way to dying.

Longevity is certainly not a strong point of this phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,205743884,Battery Sucks,2018-12-28T17:35:02.000+00:00,1,"Phone was great for about 11 months. Battery drain is out of control and came out of nowhere. Phone will completely shut off within an hour of being 100%. This phone is still being sold for an extremely high price, when Motorola should replace all of our phones. On top of that, their other z phones are sold out. So goodbye Moto, been using yalls phones since the flip phone days. Never again."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,183763557,Regular charging and battery issues and replacement costs,2018-11-28T18:26:08.000+00:00,2,"At first this phone was a very nice purchase and seemed worth every penny.  However, after 2 years I've had 3 different Moto Z droids and it has all been because eventually the battery would fail to take a charge or the USB C charging port would start to fail to recognize the fast charging."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,204807365,Good phone but missing features and several bugs.,2018-11-25T22:38:20.000+00:00,4,"Missing IR blaster for remote control devices, no Photo Gallery app (only Google Photos) and several bugs... Smart Lock is not working and you cannot disable the gradual volume option. Until I upgraded to Oreo, there wasn't a File Manager either."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,204686637,Disappointed Greatly - DO NOT BUY THIS!,2018-11-19T22:03:28.000+00:00,1,"I have always loved Motorola Products and have become brand loyal for years. March 2017 I got the new Moto Z. There was a system update end of April/Beginning of May 2018 and after that my phone would freeze, randomly shut off, get extremely hot and be at 90-100% batter life then shut off and not turn back on saying the batter was dead. I went in to Verizon and it was replaced.

Last week, another system update came through and here we are again. SAME EXACT ISSUES. This second phone is not even 6 months old! Now I have to take the time to go to the store and do all over again. 

This phone is a lemon! I am extremely disappointed in Motorola and Lenovo as I have become fans of both. 

Do not buy this phone! All the good things it does isn't worth the hassle of it crashing. I have a small child and travel a lot for work. I depend on my phone greatly. Unfortunately, I cannot rely on this one at all.

*NOTE* Both times, I had done Factory Resets as suggested and it does NOTHING! If you look in multiple chat groups, this happens to hundreds of people and they are all told to do the Factory Restore as the solution and it NEVER works."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,204138938,Not reliable,2018-10-29T15:29:34.000+00:00,1,"I used Moto G 1st gen for five years and as an upgrade I bought this phone in January 2018. First five months were amazing. Then the camera quality reduced gradually. After that now the phone restarts randomly for no good reason. It has been some time since upgrading to oreo, no new applications were installed. One morning, it just started rebooting. I calibrated the battery as instructed in forums, performed hard reset, wipe, etc. NO CHANGE!! This phone is not reliable and Motorola needs to do something."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,182944601,Horrible product,2018-10-25T01:54:46.000+00:00,1,"My phone is not even 2 years old & I can only get 3hrs on battery saver mode of use from a full charge. That's using the factory charger & letting the phone charge to 100%. Sometimes the phone decided to power down at 40-50% battery life ,then when you plug it& power it back on it says it's at 3% battery life. I called Motorola support & they said that this is not a know issue &that it sounds like my phone is getting old that's why the battery is not working as well as a brand new one. I added a battery app on my phone yesterday to see exactly how many times I have to charge the phone on different chargers just to make it through the day & a two day total has been 78 times. That's pretty said considering I'm a moderate phone user who works 10 he shifts &once I get to work I rely on my office phone & computer because my cell is so unreliable and may dye at any given moment"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,204015289,Battery heavily degraded after 9 months use,2018-10-24T17:18:37.000+00:00,1,"Accubattery on my Moto Z says it has 32% of remaining usable capacity from when it was new of 3,000mAh! 

It is not an error. It is a total of about 75, perhaps 100 full recharge cycles amount of watt-hours into the battery.

The battery is heavily degraded. I take a video and stop the video every few minutes and see it 10% less. And the phone can have power cut to it if below 50% or so if taking a video or something taxing. 

I have only used this for about 9 months, before it was in a box partially charged. 

I do leave it plugged in most of the time. Phone manufactures should put in a mode to only charge up to 80%, which yes I know the Moto mod efficiency mode will do. Relatiely inexpensive for the 2220mAh one so I ordered that to let my phone limp along. I'll see how well that works with the degraded battery.. But it should just be an option without the mod, just as many laptops can now, and most electric cars.

Same battery degradation has happened with my Moto G4, twice! I had it replaced once under warranty after about 9 months. Replacement was degrading too but then i upgraded. 

It's proof I think that the battery cell chemistry used is junk. Along with all the other bad reviews and posts. AWill the Z2 have the same issues? We'll see. 

Another issue is the glass or plastic cover for the camera, the lens, it broke soon after I started using it while in my pocket. 
Also, it thermally throttles the SOC if the battery gets about 40C, in order to keep the battery from getting too warm. Results in very slow performance in the summer time."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,203851184,Surprised by the reviews,2018-10-18T17:37:09.000+00:00,5,"I was surprised by the low rating.  I have had this phone for over a year.  I originally intended to update my phone every year, but I see no point in changing it right now as the Moto Z unlocked still appears to have the highest specs and it still works flawlessly."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,182384469,"Great phone, limited life expectancy",2018-09-26T17:59:34.000+00:00,3,"Great phone, esthetically one of the nicest out there and very robust. However, it pretty much stopped functioning a month after the warranty ended, so a little more than year after purchase. It just switches off randomly a dozen times a day even with a full charge and takes 5-10 tries to switch on again. The same thing happened with my previous Moto phone so I guess it is actually a feature of the brand."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,203245273,Bad Battery,2018-09-23T23:23:13.000+00:00,1,"After using Motorola Moto Z for about a year, I'm totally disappointed about this product. Battery life is so pure it dies in a couple of hours. When the battery is below 40% it might suddenly shut down and when turning back on it's on 1%, worst battery life I have ever seen. 

For the finish I've accidentally broke the screen and I can't replace it here in Georgia as everyone in a digital service centers say that this product was a total fail and they're not getting any replacements for this model."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,202224272,It's the best,2018-08-18T00:27:15.000+00:00,5,Had this phone for 1.5 years and love this phone.will buy one for wife
Motorola Moto Z Droid,201998568,Nice phone but not usable after about 1 year,2018-08-09T21:34:45.000+00:00,2,"I have owned this phone for a little over a year and a half at this point. Initially this phone worked great and functioned in every way that you would expect a smartphone to do. I had the battery and speaker mod and both work great. After about a year of owning, the phone began to frequently lock up with the most recent image frozen on the screen. I'd have to reset the phone for it to function. Other times it would get extremely hot and the battery would drain very quickly. More recently, it has become nearly unusable. It will frequently shut down at random battery percentages: 50%, 75%, 85%, even 95 to 100%. Recently, it has even been turning off despite being plugged into the wall charger and saying that it has 100% charge. Often, if a text or phone call comes in the phone will just turn off as soon as it starts ringing. I can no longer rely on this device as a phone or even for browsing the internet while it's plugged into wall power.  Researching on the internet, this seems to be a somewhat common problem with no apparent solution. Do not buy this phone if you hope for it to reliably function for more than 1 year."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,201914324,"Sleek, Smart but Updates slow down your phone",2018-08-07T03:56:13.000+00:00,4,"I have been using this phone for 6 months now. There are no major glitches. However, at times the cell phones used to freeze during initial days when I had made a couple of updates. Now, with no updates, it works smooth. Battery life is good if you can turn the location off. Battery dies off early than other phones as its only 2300 mAh with 5.7 inches."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,201385625,Great concept,2018-07-21T20:49:08.000+00:00,3,"I've had mine for over a year now and it still works very well most of the time. My main concern is the battery life. It is absolutely horrible. And that was  one of the big selling points that made me decide to buy the phone. If wasn't for the 3800 MAH Moto mod battery I'd be in very bad shape. And the stock speaker started getting fuzzy in less than 3 months. And now the turbo charger barely works either. Since the last update the fingerprint sensor has become an absolutely worthless button. Unless I'm missing something. But worst of all I've come to realize that Motorola does not hold it's resale 
value like Samsung or iPhone. Even though they cost pretty close to the same brand new."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,180999907,Not so good battery life,2018-07-18T03:04:45.000+00:00,3,I've had alot of internal problems with this phone my on and off button doesn't work and my volume button do not work I've only had for a year I have to trade in because I don't like it anymore. Thank you
Motorola Moto Z Droid,201078580,I have had the phone for a year now and no issues.,2018-07-09T23:17:05.000+00:00,5,I have had no issues and the phone has been though a lot of punishment. It is a great phone!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,180823213,Battery Life drain,2018-07-06T01:25:24.000+00:00,1,"My battery on my Moto Z Droid at 100% will drop incredibly fast. In 5 minutes it will drop to 80% without use. Battery life is minimum under 20 minutes. The phone shuts off at around 60% and will not turn on unless plugged in. When charging it states random percentages. My phone when manually shut off will not turn back on and taking pictures also shuts the phone off. My battery does not last through a night, I must plug it in. I have tried different restarts and do not have any large apps or apps running in the background. My phone is unreliable. These phones are also expensive and problems occurred after warranty. I tried customer service and they did not know what the problem was, many other motorola phone users have the same problem like me."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,180349345,It was decent until it was awful,2018-06-04T17:11:46.000+00:00,1,"The phone did exactly what I wanted to and I daresay I was even happy for a while.That all changed once the battery began to fail. The phone was treated well and looking at online forums it's easy to see that I am not an isolated case. The Moto Z droid is plagued with battery issues. What do I mean by battery issues? It's just depressing. My phone can now barely survive 2-3 hours of use before it dies from full charge. If you ever restart your phone and are lucky to have it actually work, it comes back stating you have <15% battery left. I can't play games, take pics/video below 65% battery because my phone will just shut off. 

This phone is truly garbage. Naturally these issues happened the month after the 12 month warranty expired."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,180085513,Junk dont buy too fragile,2018-05-17T21:07:29.000+00:00,1,junk... 3rd one in less then a year.. sending back again under manufacturer warranty. You have been forewarned........................................
Motorola Moto Z Droid,178580184,Not a good device at all when it comes to battery usage,2018-02-21T13:07:55.000+00:00,1,"On multiple occasions while using this phone, it would turn completely off due to the battery running out when the bar says it is at 30%...that should not happen on any phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,178160854,5th moto,2018-01-23T12:36:35.000+00:00,1,this is my 5th moto it is clearly a defective devise. i want a note i will pay the difference but swapping this phone 5 times for defects is a pain... please help
Motorola Moto Z Droid,178116663,I wish I never bought this phone,2018-01-21T00:45:42.000+00:00,2,Battery life is TERRIBLE!! Camera quality is sub-par at best. Didn't realize there was no phone jack on this model; never thought I would have to check for that on a phone...
Motorola Moto Z Droid,178076859,Great Phone Until the Battery Poops Out!,2018-01-18T02:07:51.000+00:00,2,"I honestly loved this phone. It was fast, thin and had plenty of storage of me! For the first year I had this phone, I would have argued with anyone the the Moto Z was the best phone on the market.  Then, literally two days after my year warranty was up, I did a system update and my battery started draining in 3 hours.  I had to put my phone on airplane mode if I wanted it to last more than 6 hours. So, since I couldn't afford to fork out another couple hundred on a phone, I bought a Motorola battery mod.  This boosted my battery life quite a bit.  However, once the mod battery is dead, my phone shortly follows. Once my phone is using it's own battery, it completely shuts down around 30%.  Once it is plugged in, it still states the battery is at 30%.  My phone shuts off on a daily basis.  I'm extremely bummed that this phone has been such a disappointment."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,177293645,Very unhappy with this device,2017-12-16T03:57:52.000+00:00,1,Have been with Verizon since September of 2017 and we have had so many problems definitely has been a bad decision on our end. My phone is terribly slow never can get my problems resolved. And it's not just one phone it's 3 phones on my plan
Motorola Moto Z Droid,177128293,If you like...,2017-12-10T21:27:38.000+00:00,1,"If you like charging your phone at least twice a day and having to reconnect your bluetooth, then this is the phone for you!
Plus side is, when you do charge it (which is often), it does charge quickly!  

I've had this phone a little over a year. It was awesome for the first few months, then suddenly it went downhill after about 6 months. I now have to carry around a portable battery charger so my phone doesn't die while I'm running errands. My phone used to connect automatically when I got in the car, then it randomly didn't connect. I renamed my phone and reconnected and that worked for a few weeks, then I had to repeat the process. 

I'm really sad about this because the phone really was nice, but I just can't handle this battery/bluetooth issue."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,176810127,"I absolutely hate this phone, and I'm not hard to please.",2017-12-07T00:37:40.000+00:00,1,"Let me start out by saying, I'm very familiar with cellphones and reasonably technologically competent. This phone took a slight learning curve to get used to. The settings are very different from another Android based phone I've used. Settings are nearly impossible to change. Simple stuff like changing the quiet mode times and Bluetooth connections. I've had the phone for about a year now and will never buy a Motorola product again.

pros- It does have a pretty decent camera and I like the quick charger."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,176168910,hate this phone!,2017-11-17T15:30:37.000+00:00,1,"I loved this phone when I first got it. As soon as I had it a year (of course no longer under warranty) it started having issues. Sometimes the speaker does not work, so when someone calls I cant hear them and they cant hear me. Lucky for me restarting it seems to help. But the most annoying part, the battery. I pick my phones for their battery life so the fact that it is now an issue sucks. It does not fully charge (have tried other chargers so that is not the problem) If I am lucky It will charge up to 85%. But it will turn off because the battery is to low as soon as it hits 55%. I pretty much have to have it plugged in all the time. If I dont, even when I am not using it I am lucky if it stays on for 2 hours. 
I just hate this phone and I wish there was something I could do, but you also can not replace the battery in this phone. So, Im pretty much stuck with a phone that has to but plugged in all the time for another year!
By the way, I am very careful with my phones, it hasnt been dropped and has no damage."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,175474680,Worst Motorola Yet and I am a loyal Droid user,2017-10-31T16:43:42.000+00:00,1,"battery is horrible, not sure what type of airplane grade aluminum is used, and the glass is fragile, have seen many that are not holding up well at all, I even remember seeing claims on how strong the glass was and touting no worries, if it breaks just let us know,,,not seeing these claims anymore.  I have been a loyal Motoral user and unfortunatley have invested too much in the Mods, if I did not, would have switched to Apple most likely,,, probably still will, just pay the price litreally,,, too bad Motorola."

September 2017 update from Verizon caused the hotspot and Bluetooth to stop working.  Verizon sent me another one, but now I have a phone that randomly reboots for no reason which is a real problem when using gps maps for travel."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,173755703,Moto Z Droid Battery Life,2017-10-16T15:42:17.000+00:00,2,"PROS: Shortcut Flashlight Feature, Shortcut Camera Feature, Fingerprint unlock feature, 2 Split-Screen feature that works only for certain apps, Turbo Charging Feature, Attractive slim phone

CONS: Probably the worst phone battery life I've had in my 10 years with Verizon, The pop out camera lens gets scratched very easy; Therefore it ruins the camera quality permanently unless you replace it just to get it scratched again, No AUX port, Uses USB Type C charging port; Therefore you would have to convert all your micro USB chargers to USB type C plus you would preferably offset the AUX port with something Bluetooth but now you have 2 different chargers to take care of, Overly sensitive built in Mic (I can't record any live concerts because the playback would sound like blown speakers)"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,173755179,great phone..to much compition,2017-10-16T15:19:09.000+00:00,4,"I had the moto for 4 months. Nothing to complain about really...good call reception,nice screen..not so great battery life..had to get the battery mod to make it threw the day. Ended up trading it in for the note 8 which in a different league altogather...the moto is worth your time if a good deal is found."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,171843707,The Absolute Worst,2017-10-05T15:38:39.000+00:00,1,"I already reviewed this phone a week ago and apparently it got taken down so I will make this one shorter.   This phone is GARBAGE.  It runs slower than John Candy.  It seems like something is running in the background causing it to be almost useless however there is nothing running.   If my phone is anywhere below 45% charged and I try to take a picture using flash, it turns off - drains the entire battery.  I hit the power button and it shows about 4%.   Plug it in - sometimes it will instantly show 25% and turn back on....other times it will even show 100%.   Even brand new this phone's battery life was atrocious.  I've had it since last Christmas and it has been nothing but trouble.   The camera (when it doesn't render my phone useless) is nice.  That's about the only good thing I can say.  I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.   Actually, I'd try and call my friends and tell them never to buy this phone, but i'm sure my phone would turn off before they have a chance to answer."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,170435779,Over priced cheaply made Motorola Garbage,2017-09-29T18:13:42.000+00:00,1,The function of this phone is slow and sloppy.  The only people that seem to like it are Motorola fans.  It does not have gorilla glass.  We have four phones and two have been dropped landing flat on the screen and the out screens are broke.  Every time the put out an update the configuration has changed.  The software on the phone is not just about completely different from when we first purchased these phone.  The battery does not last half the life they tell you it does.  With the last update they finally fixed the turbo charging feature that didn't work for about a year.  If you have small hand this is a two hand phone.  The mods that they offer are nothing special.  They are all hype and no show!  Save your money and get a real phone that's not a Motorola.  This company has simple gone down hill.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,169958411,Slow with a terrible battery.,2017-09-12T20:24:04.000+00:00,1,I attempted to upgrade from a two year old droid turbo that I thought was slow due to it's age. This phone was no faster than my old one and in some cases I think it may have been slower.  This was the only Motorola phone the store had so I took it. I live on a farm 30 miles from town so my service isn't the greatest but my old phone would last 18 hours and then some being in my poor coverage area. The moto z lasted four hours and was looking for a charge and I made one eight minute phone call and three texts in that time.  I returned the phone after seven days and had my old phone turned back on.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,169530899,Poor design.  Poor quality.,2017-08-27T04:23:02.000+00:00,1,This was about our 10th Motorola telephone. This new Droid is the worst decision I have made in purchasing a phone. The camera lens sticks out such that it scratches and cracks within a few months and it is your responsibility to pay to fix it. In addition the connector for charging stopped working after a few months on both of our phones.  We  have to use a wireless charger and a large battery pack on the back of the phone to recharge.  Motorola customer service which we had never called in the prior 10 years of having Motorola phones is abysmal.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168991478,Worst phone I've owned!!,2017-08-17T04:37:20.000+00:00,1,"I was due for my upgrade, so I went to Verizon and wanted the Samsung galaxy edge 7. I was told they didn't have any in stock, so the pushed the Moto Z on me. I told them I needed at least 64 GB....they said the Moto only comes in 32GB, but you can buy an SD card for more memory. I bought the SD card, but the only thing I can transfer onto it is pictures & videos....I can't transfer apps to it, so many times i have to delete an app before I can download a new one.
The phone has a HORRIBLE problem with shutting itself off. Many times i have been at 27-35% battery life, and it will shut itself off. Other times i will be at full battery life and it will continually shut off and on for 20 minutes before I have to do a hard reset."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168709319,Great package of features and Battery life,2017-08-14T07:31:46.000+00:00,5,My prior phone was a Moto X 2nd gen. The Moto Z Play is a step up in every way. This is a mid range phone with great performance. Where it excells is in battery life. I don't have to carry a charger or a battery pack to work any more. I can get two full days out of the battery.  I really like Motorola and there approach  to smartphones.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168708889,The Moto Z offers everything most users could ask for.,2017-08-14T05:00:08.000+00:00,5,"I buy, sell, and trade devices. I have had iPhones, Samsung Galaxy devices, HTC, LG, Sony, and many Motorola devices. I keep coming back to Motorola because they simply offer the best overall package and performance available.

The Moto Z Droid is an outstanding device. Excellent build quality, top of the line specs for 2016 with the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB RAM, along with expandable storage and a recent upgrade to Android Nougat 7.1.1.

Performance is smooth without so much as a hiccup. Motorola has the vanilla Android with Moto flavor perfected. Yes you have the Verizon bloat but these can be disabled if not removed. Any application or game you throw at this will fly. Period.

Camera performance has improved with the 7.1.1 update. Not as big of an improvement as afforded the Z Play (huge improvement) but this 13mp shooter didn't need a huge upgrade. It performs quite well for most anyone who isn't a photographer. Pictures on the Z have a clear and neutral color quality, not oversaturated. It records 4k video at 30 fps but, more importantly for me, it shoots 1080p at 60 fps. There is a noticeable difference in any device between 30 and 60 fps. You will appreciate this if you take a lot of video.

My biggest pet peeve with smartphones is their poor battery life. Admittedly I was concerned about the 2600 mAh battery in the Z. Don't be. It isn't the battery champ the Play is (my Play is currently at 23 hours battery time at 51 percent  with 4 hours and 33 minutes on-screen time running 7.1.1). However, it performs quite well in it's own right and gets me an average of 4 hours plus on-screen time. Standby time is also outstanding. Battery drain is minimal when left not charging.and screen off. 

Why get the Z over it's mid-range brother the Z Play? Well, I have both so here is what I like about the Z. It's thinner, much thinner at only 5.2 mm thick and just feels so premium in the hand. I put a carbon fiber skin on this using a style shell from Incipio on the back and it looks and feels fantastic in the hand. I also have a leather Moto style shell that feels great. Also, if you add the battery packs available the phone doesn't feel huge. I use these on longer trips and they easily get me over a day and no fatigue from the extra width or weight. 

The Z adds the quad HD display versus the 1080p on the Play. Both look excellent. However, side by side you will appreciate the difference between them. The Z also uses Gorilla Glass 4 for superior clarity. The Force, for example, has Shattershield but it won't look quite as good as this. I have a Skinomi polycarbonate screen protector on it and it feels perfect. It's also well protected. 

Call quality is fantastic, as is the norm from Motorola devices. Reception is excellent and WiFi Calling is perfect for rural areas with spotty reception and an available WiFi connection. Neither Samsung nor Apple come close in call clarity to these Moto Z devices. I have an iPhone 6s as a work device and have owned many Samsungs. They simply don't compare if you still use your phone to talk.

The elephant in the room for this device, and the Z Force, is the lack of a headphone jack. If you use Bluetooth headphones it won't matter. If you use wired cans you will need to use the USB-C dongle. To me, it isn't that big of a deal. Sound quality is average, an area I wish Lenovo would improve upon. The HTC devices have 32 bit DAC converters which make audio through headphones sound fantastic. The LG V10 and V20 also offer high end audio. 

Moto isn't the ""sexy"" choice compared to Samsung and the iPhone but it is, to me, a better choice. Simple to use, lightning fast, solid battery life, more than acceptable camera and video, a superior fingerprint sensor, gorgeous 5.5 inch AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass 4, flagship specs, and superior call quality make the Z an outstanding choice."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168650781,Motorola Moto Z (Android),2017-08-13T14:31:39.000+00:00,5,Overall excellent mobile. Would purchase upgraded version over again. Camera quality is incredible. Graphics likewise. Sleek design and comes with magnet back-cover.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168485473,Works good when its brand new,2017-08-10T01:31:20.000+00:00,2,"only thing i love about this phone is the extended battery life with the moto mod. I've had this phone for 8 months and now it freezes up for no reason and is now extremely slow. I always have the battery pack mod on for the extended life obviously but for some reason that I cannot imagine there is not a case made to fit the phone with the mod attached. A case for the power pack should be made, it's logical."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,168048553,Terrible phone.    Nothing works right,2017-08-05T22:47:33.000+00:00,1,I have had this phone since December.   1)The upgrades mess it up every time...  2) the charger doesn't work to charge it.   I have to use my car charger.  3) the battery has to be changed a couple t times a day.  4)  People call and it won't let me answer them sometimes.   Just this weekend I have had to turn it off and on 3 or 4 times.  This usually helps receiving calls. 5)  It drops calls daily.  6) There are dead spots on the screen.   7) this has been the worst phone I have ever had and I have had cell phones for 20+ years.  I can't wait for my agreement time to be up so I can get something else.   And I can assure you it will never be a Moto again!!!!!

The idea of having one speaker is a terrible design. And Motorola is no help to me at trying to  resolving  this issue.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,165453903,Heavy!,2017-07-04T12:59:04.000+00:00,3,This phone is very heavy and difficult to text from.  The extra battery pack is necessary and it's a nice feature.  This is my 4th smartphone; but I find myself coming up with reasons not to use it.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,163324743,Good phone but not what I expected. Disappointed.,2017-06-07T12:07:16.000+00:00,3,"I was a Samsung user until the Note 7 problem. I decided to switch to Verizon from Sprint to get better service. Verizon service is great! Good android phone but doesn't even compare to Samsung. My favorite parts of this phone is durable screen, and battery life. worst is the camera. Can't wait to move back to another phone just not sure which direction I want to go. Never liked the iPhone have one for work and don't like the curved screen on the Samsung. Waiting to go to the new Note 8, Pixel 2 or if Verizon gets it the Nokia 9."

The biggest issue is the battery life, it drops quickly even when not in use. Now the phone has a charging issue and will not charge. I took it to Verizon and they had a replacement phone sent out and guess what.... it has the SAME problem. She is only 5 months into having the phone so trading it in is not an option at this point unless this one is paid in full so we are stuck getting asking for replacement phones that are not even new, they are certified ""like"" new.... My mom's last phone was a Motorola and she had no issues with it, this Motorola.... not worth the price."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,162408579,Best phone I have owned!,2017-05-24T21:45:58.000+00:00,5,Great Android phone. Just switched to it from Samsung S7. Android OS works fine. Very little built in apps that hog memory. Battery life is SUPER. I needed 2 full charges a day on my Samsung S7. Now I plug in my Moto at night with more than 60% charge left. Fast charge feature can recharge phone from 60% to full in less than 1/2 hour. Screen is sharp and clear. Photos are great. Can add micro SD card configured as main memory. That means you don't have to manage memory between built in memory and extra micro SD. Really recommend this phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,162298775,Disappointing,2017-05-23T18:55:24.000+00:00,2,"We have been a family of Motorola phone fans, but this one missed the mark. Battery life is horrible and that is even with the Kate Spade battery mod. The mod only ads maybe two hours to the life of the phone. With minimal use my phone lasts about 8 hours with the battery mod. My husband got the Force because he has damaged many phone screens in the past and he is having much more luck. I know that phone has a better battery but I would expect the one on mine to at least make it through the day. It also shuts off between 10-20%, too. Definitely will consider a different brand after this experience."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,160496854,It was love at 1st sight but faded quickly,2017-05-03T21:35:46.000+00:00,3,The phone was awesome at 1st.  I brought the battery mode and a couple of cases.  Loved the feel and look of it.  The speed of the phone is great as it plays all my games without any lags.  The problems I first noticed were when I was using the bluetooth functions.  It seems like every song would have a pause or interruption of some kind. This was the case regardless of whether I was using bluetooth headphone or connecting the phone to my car stereo or home speakers.  Why would they eliminate the headset jack but then use an inferior bluetooth antennae.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,159871025,A big disappointment,2017-04-28T06:18:37.000+00:00,1,"The Motorola Moto Z Droid has been a big disappointment because the camera freezes, you can't assign a ring tone to a group, or, go between the camera and photos.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,159784099,The worst phone ever,2017-04-26T21:19:42.000+00:00,1,"My husband and I got the Moto Z force phones. When I purchased this phone I came from a note 3. I wanted the note 7 that they came out with but they no longer offer those, nor did they have an note 5, so I decided to try out a Moto Z force. 
If you are trying for something to compare to a Samsung this is not the phone. I don't like the fact that my phone basically runs off Google everything. I have big hands to while holding my phone, while typing, my fingers touch the glass, and that messes with what I am doing. My husband's works in a bodyshop he felt this phone would be a good phone to take to work... Well his screen is scratched up bad, his speaker barley works, it's crackles. 
We bought these phones 6 months ago, the speaker shouldn't be gone already.
My Samsungs lasted me years!!!!! Once we can upgrade we will be going back to Samsung I regret wasting my time and money on this phone."

It's been off the charger for 3 hours and am at a 61% charge. That's just idling. I don't listen to music on it anymore nor use navigation..

I am in love with this phone and service! Apps download in literally 1 second! I will have a BUNCH of apps and services running at the same time and this phone and service can handle it. Sometimes if I push too hard, the screen will turn off and I have to wait a minute, to get back in, but that is totally understandable. The only issue that I have, is the Virtual Keyboard. For some stupid reason, they included an Emoticon button, but when you click it, the first time that comes up is flags. I mean come on, flags? So you have to get used the the idea, that you might type in a flag. This can easily be changed. Why not let us, customize everything about the keyboard? I'm not talking about the current edit features, I mean EVERYTHING. That is okay though. In time. Other then that, the phone is flawless!!! I Love You Motorola and Verizon!

I rated it a 4 out of 5 because I still believe it's a little high but worth penny.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156942556,Love my Moto!,2017-04-02T01:42:39.000+00:00,5,I got it because my sister has one and recommended it. I value her opinion. This is way more than you'll ever get again...Be happy with what you got.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156341703,Great phone love Motorola and Droid,2017-03-28T21:55:16.000+00:00,5,"This is a great phone and love the Speck cover. Note this phone uses USB-C connection which is a change from my old phone so had to get all new connectors such as car charger and USB-C to USB to connect to laptop and headphones. Transition to new phone was super easy, Verizon transfers Contacts, I just reinstalled Apps."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156214058,My Moto force,2017-03-28T10:43:53.000+00:00,2,"Difficult to navigate, due to constant pop up notifications. Answering the phone was even hard because of this."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156192137,Great phone,2017-03-27T22:48:19.000+00:00,5,"Being that I was coming from a very old Motorola phone to a smart phone, it was very intimidating but with a little patience it has became a easy transition.  Just remember with so many features it will just take time to learn them all."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156127834,"It's okay, I'm still  adjusting.",2017-03-27T15:00:23.000+00:00,4,"I like the phone, however I've noticed when I make a call it almost sounds like I'm in a tunnel. Reception is usually good otherwise, just something I noticed. Also sometimes at the edge of the screen it isn't responsive. Like when I'm texting and try to touch the letter ""p"" on the edge it doesn't register."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156124265,Good features and easy transition,2017-03-27T14:29:59.000+00:00,5,"The phone is amazing! It has a great camera,storage is large ,sound quality is great. Definitely would recommend to a family member or friend"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,156031247,Requires some effort but once tamed works well.,2017-03-26T15:09:55.000+00:00,4,Bluetooth has problems especially in disconnect. It disconnects itself and then has trouble finding paired devices
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155965409,Okay,2017-03-25T18:53:42.000+00:00,3,"I like how the figure print scanner works. It's fast and smooth, but the battery life terrible. The battery mod is 100% needed to get a full day use out of it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155910300,Moto z,2017-03-25T14:28:43.000+00:00,5,"Great phone hard to get use to the size though
The cases are expensive for the phone, but overall like it so far"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155906982,droid review,2017-03-25T13:13:44.000+00:00,3,"Still a little worried about c type charger connection, too flimsy, seen too make designs fail ex: usb ports on previous models.

no ear bud plug, really need a pigtail to use? not everyone uses bluetooth"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155884097,Average compared to HTC One,2017-03-24T22:02:11.000+00:00,3,"I've only had the phone for a week so I still adjusting.   On the plus side the phone charges rapidly.  On the negative side to answer the phone I have to slide the phone icon to answer.  I want to be able to tap answer.  

Also it makes too much noise ( beeping vibrating etc).  Received 50+ text messages from the Verizon network in under 24 hours which turned out to be a network problem. Had to mute conversation.  Could find nothing online so returned to the store.  Fix was in progress. 

It's a feature rich phone with some annoyances. Let me use it for a while and I'll follow up."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155875069,Fantastic,2017-03-24T19:23:48.000+00:00,5,"The phone is very fast, very reliable, high quality, and it is capable of doing everything I need it to do. I am excited to buy and try all of the new mods."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155812245,Hard to get around,2017-03-24T13:44:23.000+00:00,1,"Not completely satisfied with my phone, I find it hard to get around the different apps... The cloud transfer of my contact list didn't transfer right. Battery life is not an all day thing. The salesman talked me out of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I do regret my decision and it's too late to exchange phones by 3 days"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155613573,Droid Moto,2017-03-21T19:39:13.000+00:00,4,It's a great phone great quality pictures are awesome it's just the battery does not last as long as I was initially told it would I have to put it on the charger 2 to 3 times a day
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155508944,It was easy to use,2017-03-20T20:06:00.000+00:00,4,I like how you can transfer modules so easy to your phone and play music on it sound quality is great no more dropped calls and you can here so clearly.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155395504,Trick phone!!!,2017-03-20T03:35:18.000+00:00,4,"No doubt the phone is thin and fits into my jacket pocket, back slacks or even a shirt pocket super easy.  The speed of the processor vs my old Samsung Note 3 is night and day.  The screen quality is also vastly better and clear.  Not sure if its as good as my 4k TV but sure seems to be.  Transfer of all my old data no problem.  If there were a gripe I would say that having been used to one way on the Samsung for so long makes doing a transition even tougher but Im getting better at it.  Sending pics vs my old method is not as swift, but it may again be habit of my old pattern.  I simultaneously got a IPHONE 7 when I took a new position with my current employer and it is so much better screen and size for a 54 year old guy.  Nice job Motorola.  Finally, having the extra magnetic accessories to quickly switch to seems exciting.  I started with only the excess battery and have already ordered the camera, projector, and JBL speakers for when Im working or in need of some tunes."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155387571,Fast feedback and very dependable,2017-03-20T00:36:10.000+00:00,5,The phone opens apps very quickly and with the advanced lte the phone responds quickly to anything I open or browse. Has a great battery life and i love having the ability to purchase moto modz such as the jbl speaker and the projector attachment which i think would be awsome during watching netflix videos on my phone and the fact that it will connect to the google daydream vr. I also enjoy the stylish magnetic back designs i can put on. The phones shatterproof display is a huge plus and its camera takes magnificent photos. The front flash was a great touch as well. The phone needs a different charger than the original android charger which is a small drawback but i presume thats due to the power it takes to recharge this beast. The phone also uses a dongle instead of having a headphonr port but i like listening through bluetooth anyways. The fingerprint scanner works extremely fast to open and unlock your device. I also enjoy having the ability to wave my hand over the phone to turn the screens active display on and check the time and i also enjoy being able to shake the phone to quickly open the flashlight and rotate the phone repeatedly to quickly open the camera. The phone also has 2 lights for the phones rear flash and flashlight producing a substancial amout of light making it easy to see in the dark. This phone cobnects to my vehicle very easily and plays my music through spotify immidiately where as on my old galaxy s7 it would constantly open up google play music forcing me to close google play music and reopen spotify. All this for about the same price as the iphone 7. I recommend this phone to any true android enthusiast as this phone was built powerful and strong.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,155182690,"Phone is great, except battery life",2017-03-17T23:57:24.000+00:00,3,"I really expected it to at least be as good as my old phone on battery but drains quickly, very disappointed"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154888383,Waiting for second replacement in the first month,2017-03-15T23:12:24.000+00:00,1,"Two failed phones in less than a month.  On original phone, after two weeks blue tooth would not work.  Replacement was a refurbished unit ( we had paid for new phone just two weeks earlier).  The second phone went two weeks also.  This time the volume and one-off buttons quit working altogether.  Also the volume could not be controlled be the settings function.  We are now waiting for number three.  NOT HAPPY!"

Motorola Moto Z Droid,154852542,In a Bad Mood Ever Since I Got Moto Z,2017-03-15T01:21:04.000+00:00,1,"If it were not for the snap-on camera, I would hate this phone completely. Entering a text message, every word has missed hit characters. Tried to enlarge font in settings and it didn't help at all. Having to toggle to another screen to input symbols is a pain. Typing in Google search bar sucks. I run my business from my phone and the days are very long and unproductive these days. Oh, and now the Verizon chat box pops up and wants to help me. Really? Tell Motorola to include an instruction booklet with their over-priced phone. Try to find info online, forget about it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154825205,Moto z,2017-03-14T19:39:22.000+00:00,5,The moto z is really nice and light the mods for it are amazing the speacker is pretty loud for its size and the projector has pretty good quality and the camera is really good quality too charger mod woyld of been good if i could plug it in cause not everyone has wireless charging only thing i did not like about the phone is that for ear plugs its the same as the charging plug
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154520424,good phone bad speaker,2017-03-12T07:29:29.000+00:00,3,The moto z is a okay smartphone but the speaker is weak and the battery doesn't last all do even if you really don't use it.I don't know if I should return it before the 14 days and get a iphone 7 plus or just keep it and  deal with it

It stopped charging 3 weeks ago - it would acknowledge the charger being plugged into the phone - car or home.  Tried it in the store - also failed.  Returned NEW phone, one that I am still making payments on and will continue to do so for over a year and a half, and was sent a REFURBISHED Moto.  Well three weeks later, the REFURBISHED MOTO is once again not charging easily - very erractic!  AND, the voice commands failing.  Verizon has been very unhelpful!!!  I have spent hours on the phone and online with them.  i am once again on the phone with them.  i am done!!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154414482,Moto Z droid,2017-03-11T13:55:21.000+00:00,3,The battery doesn't hold a charge. I usually have to charge it mid afternoon after charging it at night. Never had that problem with my iPhone. The screen is good size. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154404973,Not impressed especially with the cost,2017-03-11T03:12:15.000+00:00,3,"Not up to all the hoopla.. Just OK

Just repeating on purpose to make the 100 character minimum
Not up to all the hoopla.. Just OK"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154392008,Easy to learn,2017-03-10T21:15:53.000+00:00,4,Once I figured out how to access the settings it was easy to set up and use. The only problem is the location of the buttons on the upper right side. They are right where you want to hold the phone in landscape position
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154314248,Good phone with some faults,2017-03-09T20:41:08.000+00:00,4,No headphone jack. Have to take off the case to remove attachments. Attachments are difficult to remove. Other than that it's a great phone. Functions excellent and does everything a smart phone should do.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154312214,Great phone,2017-03-09T19:54:03.000+00:00,5,"Good features, great battery life. Outperformed my old Droid by leaps and bounds. Very happy with this purchase."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,154263596,Very good upgrade!!,2017-03-09T12:18:37.000+00:00,4,My wife and I both got these phones. After her phone getting HOT and getting it traded out everything is fine. Very quick and user friendly. The options including the fingerprint scanner are awesome. Being able to access the flashlight with the double hatchet motion. The camera being accessed by flipping the wrist is awesome. Highly recommended for any ones upgrade..
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154248304,Moto,2017-03-08T22:25:36.000+00:00,5,It's a good phone. It has alot of cool things to add to the phone like the camera and speakers. I would recommend this phone
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154244956,"Fast, but battery leaves alot to be desired",2017-03-08T21:00:54.000+00:00,4,"It is fast, screen easy to ready, charges quickly, and navigation is easy. The battery is not any better than my old Droid Turbo which is the main reason I bought a new phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154163064,battery sucks.,2017-03-07T21:08:05.000+00:00,2,so far the battery sucks and the reception was better in my old phone. The battery runs down too quickly.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154162156,Speaker,2017-03-07T20:53:26.000+00:00,4,When talking to people I hear background static also when the phone is ringing on their end I hear static. There is a phone number it doesn't like to connect to
Motorola Moto Z Droid,154054437,Easy to navigate,2017-03-07T00:51:16.000+00:00,4,"Really like the phone, only thing I'm a little set off by is how many updates I've had to do in just the first week of having it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153988289,Nice glass on front BUT camera glass is another story,2017-03-06T16:09:41.000+00:00,1,"I thought I was upgrading from my LG G3 but is a down grade. the phone is slower, some. Nice and thin. And is a good phone EXCEPT the camera glass is fragile. about a month ago I took the phone out of its case and the camera glass was broken. I am just now posting because I thought Id try to find a replacement. NO!!!!! Not Verizon nor any after market can get the part. I have serious doubts whether I will even own another Motorola phone and am seriously considering leaving Verizon for selling products they cant replace parts."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153983097,Good phone but not what I expected.,2017-03-06T14:48:00.000+00:00,3,"Cons: Battery doesn't last near what I thought it would. Has a tendency to change my ringtones/notifications for no reason. You have to buy a new charger for it so all of the previous android cords I have do me no good. There is no spot for head phones or earbuds; have to by a special adapter that goes into the charging port therefore you cannot use earbuds and charge the phone at the same time. 

Pros: It takes really good pictures. The new cord can fully charge my phone (from 0%) in 1.5 hours. Speaker is pretty good. Has a thumbprint lock if you wish to use it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153955108,GREAT PHONE WITH GREAT FEATURES!!,2017-03-06T00:11:55.000+00:00,5,"I was a little skeptical at first but after getting used to the new phone I really liked it more and more.  The processor is great and loads everything very fast.  I love the MOTO gesture mod and use it to turn my flashlight on at work or to turn the camera on in a flash to capture that quick spur of the moment photo opportunity that sometimes passes you by when trying to get to the camera through the phone interface.  I use the phone all day at work and the battery lasts me all day without needing to charge it but to make sure I never have to worry about it, I purchased the battery mod for it.  The mods are another great feature and turns the phone into many different devices that can enhance the user experience both personal and professional.  The fingerprint scanner to turn the phone on works great and  makes it easy to turn the phone on and off.  Overall I think that Motorola did a great job on this phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153929253,The Droid Z the best Droid since the Razor!!,2017-03-05T21:57:32.000+00:00,5,I love the new accerorie speaker for when I'm taking showers. I don't like taking the speaker outside incase I drop it it because I like it so much but it's perfect for my me time in the restroom. I purchased the battery pack for special trips but I don't think I'll use it much because I LOVE my new otterbox commuter case so much. All around I don't have any negative feedback about the new droid Z. So far it's my favourite android that has come out so far. I hope I can use this phone for years to come.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153906329,New Moto Z Droid,2017-03-05T20:07:52.000+00:00,5,Went from a flip phone to the Moto Z Droid...Very easy!  The Verizon store employee made it simple...Can not imagine an easier conversion. I

Motorola Moto Z Droid,153714417,The Moto Z Play,2017-03-04T21:07:48.000+00:00,5,"I've had two smart phones in the past. A Samsung G3 and G4. They would not last very long and I would need a new battery Evey 4 or 5 months. I've had this Moto Z Play for 2 months now and I like it. The battery lasts a long time at least 2 days of constant use. Streaming music at work using WiFi and Bluetooth for 8 solid hrs with the battery at 85%. The G4 would need a recharge at lunch time just sitting there not doing anything. The Moto Z Play has a big display too, just as big as my wife's Apple 7 pluss. The camera is pretty good too. It is every bit as good as the Apple in my opinion for half the price. Oh yeah. There are some cool Doo dad's that can snap on to the phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153578087,Love the new features!!,2017-03-03T20:35:32.000+00:00,5,I love how all my pictures automatically back up to the cloud. I also enjoy how light weight the phone is.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153334531,Great so far,2017-03-01T21:13:56.000+00:00,5,"Easy to use, great high def screen. Camera takes great pictures, crisp videos. Like the extra storage option."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,153205622,Moto Z review,2017-03-01T02:22:31.000+00:00,1,If I could give it  negative stars I would. The apps constantly act up and the service and battery life are horrible. Thanks Verizon store for recommending such a horrible phone!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153178521,Better transition than I thought,2017-02-28T21:29:17.000+00:00,4,"I am pleased with the device itself, and am quickly learning the features since I had a earlier version of Motorola. I was so grateful everything got transferred so easily from my old phone. I was so glad to find a user manual online for some quick answers."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,153151884,Great phone!,2017-02-28T20:21:17.000+00:00,5,"My husband, 17 yr old daughter & I were due for an upgrade. We had previously owned 2 galaxy s5's & 2 galaxy s4's but 3 out of the 4 of them had quit working entirely, I was forced to use an old phone which was the Motorola razor that was pretty old but still worked pretty well even though the screen was smashed so I knew I didn't want another galaxy & that I wanted a Motorola phone since they seemed to be made well. I had been thinking about getting the moto z but after my husband compared the Samsung s7 & the moto z force he decided on the moto z force, so all 3 of us ended up with one! I love my phone! It's made very well & has many awesome features! I plan on buying the camera & projector attachments as well!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152764803,Very functional and easy to navigate,2017-02-28T13:20:27.000+00:00,5,My last motorla served me well. I kept it months pass my upgrade date because it was a good product.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152760948,Great new phone!,2017-02-28T10:54:39.000+00:00,5,Great Android phone!  Love the features and accessories.  Really easy and smooth transition from iOs
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152747830,Great phone!,2017-02-28T02:03:10.000+00:00,4,"Moto Z is an excellent phone!  Good size- fairly larg, but easily pocketable.  I was hoping to get the LG V20.  This was my second choice, but I'm very happy.  I like the removable memory, but wish it had a removable battery too.  Camera seems pretty decent.  App performance is great.  Call and data performance is great.  

Moto mods are a nice idea that could be expanded more.  No need for a projector.  JBL speaker would be better if it also had a Bluetooth option so it could also be controlled from a distance.  Hasselblad camera is a nice idea, but even though it has a nice zoom it still has a tiny cell phone sized sensor.  :-(  That just leaves the covers and batteries.   Covers offer no added protection for the phone.  While they look cool, they do nothing.  The battery options sometimes include wireless charging, but none have a USB-C rapid charging plug.  I see a lot of potential with mods, but nothing that makes me want to rush out and buy it.  

I like the ideas on the LG V20 of keeping a spare battery and charger around and then swapping it when I need it, and the separate wide angle camera.  The Moto Z however doesn't need to be powered off to add a battery mod, or any mod for that matter.  The user interface on the Moto Z is great.  I haven't felt the urge to get custom launchers as I did with previous phones.  Overall highly recommend!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152742309,Great service,2017-02-28T01:35:58.000+00:00,5,Love the Moto z. Brilliant color screen with so much to do. The only thing is battery life kind drains way too quick
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152731268,I like moto Z a lot . Am very pleased .,2017-02-28T00:52:28.000+00:00,5,The sales person was very helpful and very courteous . He suggested I add my landline phone which I did and it saved money to do this .
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152693878,This phone has everything!!!,2017-02-27T23:19:39.000+00:00,5,I love this phone....Perfect size and it works like a charm. Speaker aren't the best but you can purchase the JBL mod for a reasonable price.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152691010,Maybe I got a lemon?,2017-02-27T23:17:41.000+00:00,1,"I was very disappointed in the battery life of this phone.  I had to recharge it several times a day.  I had a Verizon store look at it, and we disabled any apps that could have been draining the battery, and I turned off bluetooth, wifi while sleeping, etc.  I switched back to my previous brand."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152667966,Great features and twice the memory of other Droid telelphones out there,2017-02-27T22:08:37.000+00:00,5,I love to use my phone for picture taking. So the added memory is nice and it can back them up to Google photos.  It also will backup to many other cloud services.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152667598,Daily Upgrades put the phone out of commission for 20 minutes :(,2017-02-27T22:04:26.000+00:00,4,"I'm frustrated that there is a Daily System upgrade that makes my phone unavailable for 20 minutes at a time, and uses my data to process the upgrade."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152664307,Camera was not at all what I expected,2017-02-27T21:32:31.000+00:00,3,"Like the phone and the idea of all that it should do. The camera has let me down, although I do like the flash on selfie mode. Having Bluetooth problems when driving.... Not so safe. I hear a weird noise during phone calls, considering getting something different"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152625477,"Nice looking, clear sound, takes great photos",2017-02-27T06:02:00.000+00:00,4,"Pros: Nice looking phone. Sound is great when talking on the phone (clear and no trouble hearing the person I'm speaking with). Doesn't ever cut out or drop calls. Takes great photos. Overall I'm pleased with it. 

Cons: I don't like that it wakes up constantly and reacts to my every move. I really feel like it's spying on me. I'm in the habit now of placing it face down on the table so I don't see it waking up all the time. Battery runs out by the end of the day if I'm using several apps. I use a card reader for my business and plugging it in to the flexible cord adaptor is not the best system for swiping cards. I miss the headphone jack."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152620371,It's not what I expected,2017-02-27T02:51:43.000+00:00,4,I expected it to have more features & to be more advanced especially with the money I spent. I VERY much REGRET buying this phone & will NEVER by a Motorola phone again. It's a cheap unimpressive phone. I'm telling everyone NOT to buy one.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152474953,I like it,2017-02-25T21:29:43.000+00:00,3,"I really like the phone. I enjoy being able to wave my hand over the phone and the time pops up. The HD voice is so cool. It sounds like the person is sitting next to you when you're talking to them. I also like the camera. It takes really nice pictures. I'm not so happy with the no headphone jack. You have to get Bluetooth headphones if you want to listen to music while your phone is charging. I also had to return two of these phones because the battery drained fast. So far the third phone I have has a good amount of battery. My last phone drained from 100% to 85% in one hour. Overall, the phone is pretty good, other than the battery issue."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152399611,The transition was very easy and these phones are perfect.,2017-02-25T05:42:17.000+00:00,5,We looked at the Moto Z Droids. We have always had the Samsung Galaxies. We were hesitant to make the change. However the more we looked at the Moto Z the more interested we were. So we took the plunge and my husband and I both got the Moto Z.  We both love them. They are easy to use since we are already used to androids and the clarity of the screen is awesome. The size is perfect. The phone makes great pictures. We got a great deal and also got cases for both phones while we were there. We are happy happy happy!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152262622,Love it,2017-02-23T20:48:22.000+00:00,5,We love our new phones. Easy to use and has great functionality. Would recommend the Moto z to all of my friends
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152259749,Great,2017-02-23T20:05:57.000+00:00,3,"I don't like that it didn't come with more accessories, or that  you can't charge it and listen to music at the same time I don't like that the adapter is an attachment that you need to"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152215831,Good phone with a couple of settings that don;t make sense,2017-02-23T17:38:31.000+00:00,4,"I decided to update my LG with the Moto Z.  My wife has had this phone and found that it was a superior calling tool compared to LG.  However, because it does not have a hole to insert a jack to a headphones, you are to use an adapter that plugs into the jack and that will plug into the same space as the charger.

So I purchased a Bluetooth device to bypass the need to block the charger."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152160581,Moto Z Learning Curve,2017-02-22T21:43:06.000+00:00,4,"I was unable to pair my new phone with my Lexus Bluetooth and drove my car to the dealership for their assistance.  After their non-success for over an hour, I drove to the Verizon store for their assistance.  Again having no success, it was eventually determined that I had received a defective phone.  The replacement was quickly paired with my car by Verizon.  I had some questions as I struggled with my learning curve on other features, such as copy/cut and paste to the Clipboard that I couldn't find online.  But eventually I was able to figure that and other issues I had and it is getting easier to use now."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152102661,Phone,2017-02-22T12:08:58.000+00:00,4,"My only issue is that the phone does not have an additional  port for the 
headset/ear bud only.
You have to have an attachment to use head accessories, which is included with the package.  One port is utilized for all."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,152085193,Not what it's hyped up to be,2017-02-22T00:26:24.000+00:00,3,I traded the Google pixel 5 inch in for the Moto Z droid only because of the size of the screen. The phone does lag compared to the pixel and lacks a few features such as Google assistant. The battery life is not so great but the phone is super slim
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151961145,Moto Z Review,2017-02-21T03:18:20.000+00:00,4,It was pretty easy to move from the Samsung 4S to Moto Z. The only thing I do not like is the size. It is too big to put in a pocket. The Samsung had a better size.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151958378,Nice Phone,2017-02-21T03:01:22.000+00:00,5,The phone is great. A definite improvement over my Galaxy S5. I really like the fingerprint scanner. The lack of a physical home button took some getting used to.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151923279,Top of Line,2017-02-21T01:06:26.000+00:00,5,"Product and Service is ahead of the game! Everything you need from home,business,or personal use at your fingertips."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,151874585,okay phone,2017-02-20T18:42:43.000+00:00,1,Upsold this phone and don't care for it. Battery life isn't any better than the previous one. Not worth it.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151862979,transition to a new phone,2017-02-20T16:26:29.000+00:00,4,"There were a few things that didn't transition smoothly. The day after I bought the phone, it went through multiple updates. I was not expecting this. Battery life was aweful but has resolved. Email transition was problematic but seems to have resolved itself as well. I lost my texts...Somehow my wifi was turned off and it has cost me almost all my data two weeks early. Not real happy about that.The store and customer service have been responsive."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151850297,very nice phone,2017-02-20T12:42:14.000+00:00,5,This phone is great.  It has a great display and takes excellent pictures.  The phone features and controls are excellent.  I am very impressed.  This is my first droid but won't be my last.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151810561,LG to Moto,2017-02-19T23:59:52.000+00:00,4,"Easy to use. I think it is a bit clunky, but otherwise a good phone. The screen colors are vibrant and the sound quality is good."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151801102,Moto Z Droid,2017-02-19T22:43:24.000+00:00,4,I'm still learning the different features as I go. I like the size of the phone. I also like the battery's quick charging time.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151795293,Phone works great. Service works well when there isn't some outage from nowhere.,2017-02-19T22:32:14.000+00:00,5,"So what if there's a family emergency, yet there's some outage and the phone can't be used. Makes me question the reliability of the service you offer."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151784424,Great phone,2017-02-19T20:47:03.000+00:00,5,The device is awesome just a little to big. Can't fit it in my pocket. Battery life is great so far.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151783446,Nice screen size,2017-02-19T20:38:44.000+00:00,4,"Switching from an phone, little challenging at first, but now am loving it! Love the camera, great pictures, easier to get apps, like the size."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151731680,Too many adds and drop call,2017-02-19T06:01:43.000+00:00,1,Too many adds and drop calls never get over three bars nice phone like the sides of it but it's not a real Android
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151688598,"Still learning how to use.  Sometime I have a problem answering the phone, but I am very pleased with it.",2017-02-18T22:09:37.000+00:00,5,Excellent phone.  Love the clearness of the screen and the brightness it affords. Love the features the phone has to offer.  Great product.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151683328,Good phone lot faster but things for it cost to much,2017-02-18T21:13:30.000+00:00,5,Have nothing bad to say about it and would get another one for my wife and daughter and tell everyone to get one
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151640325,Great phone,2017-02-18T15:27:19.000+00:00,5,This phone works in my metal building which is great . I don't loss service as easy as before. And I can answer it without hanging up on the person calling
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151593223,Droid Z,2017-02-18T02:05:17.000+00:00,2,"I am not getting as strong a signal as I did with my previous Droid Turbo, Messages are getting hug up, not delivered. Pandora does not work as smoothly as with the previous unit. Minor plus - are the thinness of the unit and longer battery life.  However, I have several chargers in home, office and car so it is not that big a plus."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151544258,"Terrible features, not at all user friendly.  My LG was a much better easier phone to use",2017-02-17T21:12:46.000+00:00,1,The instructions are too technical and difficult to understand.  The camera is like this question.  What do you want add photo add video ???????????????
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151534078,Pretty cool phone,2017-02-17T19:49:46.000+00:00,4,"My biggest issue is the reject/answer/message button. It's going to take some getting used to...as I'm used to being able to swap in either direction.
I do really like the phone...have gotten asked ""what phone is THAT?"""
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151517807,"Great features, very responsive !! You could not pay me to take a Samsung now.",2017-02-17T17:36:01.000+00:00,5,"I can't believe how fast the Droid is,how responsive it is.  I have had Samsung products for years, and now... You can not pay me to have another Samsung phone.
It just won't happen. The pixels are better,it's so much faster, it charges so much faster as well, it's amazing."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151473994,Learning a better way to communicate...,2017-02-17T12:54:24.000+00:00,4,It is good to have state-of-the-art technology at my fingertips. Switching from a slide-phone to this Droid has been relatively simple.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151365836,Motorola Moto Z Droid,2017-02-16T20:02:58.000+00:00,5,"The phone works perfectly, it is better that Motorola droid turbo that I had. I would recommend the Moto Z to a friend!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151321245,Sucks and it's slow,2017-02-16T12:13:01.000+00:00,1,This phones sucks bad it slow it keeps making everything on the the phone big like it's in zoom all the time takes forever to type in number so like the galaxy better
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151285603,Good transition from the Samsung s4,2017-02-16T04:19:21.000+00:00,4,Wasn't sure what to expect and I am still getting used to it. Mostly I had to get used to new placement on features. I love that the hot spot is not an app anymore but a setting like WiFi or bluetooth
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151226597,Difficult adapting to reading info on line.  Prefer hard copy.  Unable to print info without a printer.,2017-02-15T21:50:02.000+00:00,3,"It is moving slowly.  Need tutorial session.  Should offer a session and some staff should be able to answer inquiries and be more accommodating, especially to elderly who are trying to keep updated."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151223636,So far so good,2017-02-15T21:13:57.000+00:00,4,Had it 2 weeks. Still can't figure out how to screenshot. Other than that everything seems to be OK. Does the job very well. I use it every day for work. Basic functionality nearly mirrors my Samsung g4.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151222969,Meh...It's OK.,2017-02-15T21:06:34.000+00:00,3,I got this phone because I got a good price on it. I had a Samsung Note 3 for about 3 years and it was finally starting to get herky jerky on me. I like the Note better because everything on it seemed more logical for someone who is not a techie. ....Maybe in a couple of more months I might grow to love this phone but right now we only have a Luke warm relationship.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151220733,Love it!!,2017-02-15T20:42:31.000+00:00,5,The phone was easy to learn how to do things. I love the big screen. It is also faster than any phone that I have had. It also takes beautiful and sharp pictures.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151214836,Not a fan,2017-02-15T19:56:44.000+00:00,2,"I don't like the notifications process.  It's awkward and requires multiple steps to get to the information, which defeats the point of the notification short cuts.  It's also particular on the action required to answer the phone...again the point of the entire product."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,151194023,Great features.,2017-02-15T18:59:33.000+00:00,5,"The great, fastest way to get any information related to daily basics, easy to use and understand. SZ"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150967003,Felt forced into the choice,2017-02-15T00:14:37.000+00:00,2,"I loved my previous LG phone, but it just shut down one day. When I took it into the Verizon store they had trouble getting into it. Then it just rebooted as if a new phone. When I said that I needed to be able to rely on the phone because of my job, I was handed this Moto Z Droid. I wasn't too enthusiastic because I had had an earlier version that had not been a good experience. At least I got started quickly, but I'm not a fan of the keyboard and I'm having trouble getting completely connected to my office Outlook, especially the Contact list. Hard to explain, but I miss the phone that crashed."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150938385,Easy transition from my previous phone.,2017-02-14T20:39:02.000+00:00,5,My Moto Z Droid seems to be keeping a charge longer than my previous phone.  I also like how thin and lightweight it is.

The camera is good also 
Just love this phone. Great deal and so glad I bought it"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150692814,WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED!!,2017-02-13T04:24:58.000+00:00,1,"I have had this phone since August of this year and so far I am on my 3rd replacement!!! Each phone has corrupted more then one SD card, and with each one once the corrupting of the memory card happens that's when it all of a sudden the phone will not ring, no notifications go off, no alarms.... Nothing!!! Verizon and Motorola have been no help what so ever besides ""let's try yet another factory reset"", ""let's try clearing your cache for the ten millionth time!"", ""O OK let's send u out another replacement!"". So now I am stuck with this phone for almost 2 years.... I am paying all this money for a phone that has never worked properly due to no fault of my own and apparently it's never going to work properly! You would think Verizon would care more about their customers satisfaction and provide them with phones that actually work or at least try to give them more options when it comes to that same issue with 3 of the same phones in less then 6 months!! Situations like this they should make an exception and allow the customers to switch to another device under warranty.... Not asking for ya know a newer high end phone.... I would rather have a downgraded phone that actually does what it supposed to then deal with one that doesn't."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150681414,Awesome Phone,2017-02-13T01:57:57.000+00:00,4,"Very fast phone and the battery last for days. Love compare to other phone.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,150668062,Awesomeness,2017-02-12T23:33:40.000+00:00,5,"The best phone I have ever owned. Will stick with this product cause I trust it, and trust in a product these days is so hard to come by. When my Moto G3, which is an old model, ran out of room I went straight for another Motorola phone. Thanks Motorola!!! I bought one Moto Z Play for me and one for my brother, and I tell everyone about its features"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150666296,Problems with my NEw Moto Z Droid,2017-02-12T23:12:41.000+00:00,3,Just upgraded my phone other one was old and would not hold a charge all day.  My new Moto Z has speaker problems it has crackling and you can not hear!  Verizon rep has ordered me a new one.  Taking more of my time to go back and get the new phone.  Phone somes with several apps that I will never use.  Wish I could pick which apps I want.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150662797,horrible battery life,2017-02-12T22:39:30.000+00:00,1,"This phone has the worst battery life of any phone I've ever used.  If you only use your phone for calls and text messages, the battery life is fine, but if that's the case, you don't really need a smart phone.  If you're using features that justify having a smart phone, the battery life is not going to be sufficient."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150661747,A good phone,2017-02-12T22:30:11.000+00:00,4,I was set on getting the Galaxy S7 as my upgrade from my S5 which was an upgrade from the S3. Loved my Galaxy's.  After seeing this phone and doing the research I decided to go with it instead. I've been very happy with the choice.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150645254,It was easy transferring from my galaxy s4 to this Droid. It's a nice phone.,2017-02-12T19:55:18.000+00:00,5,Great phone for the price. So far I am happy with all its features. And I love how big the screen is. I am able to read my text messages with no problems.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150596361,Not so happy with new phone,2017-02-12T05:54:59.000+00:00,3,"Took away many simpler features that my Samsung 5 phone had, had a better speed dial feature, better way to figure out the phone, better photo gallery, cannot figure out how to use my external SD card, instead of one step, things take 2 or sometimes 3 steps. Snapfish doesn't recognize the pictures from my phone only the what's app ones. Took a long time for the video feature to get a clear picture,.Had to press the button countless times."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150573147,Roni,2017-02-12T01:26:19.000+00:00,2,I hate this phone only like big screen I can't upload my pics only download not able charge and lusten to headset is not obtion unless you have wireless
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150552574,different,2017-02-11T22:28:37.000+00:00,4,Still learning how to use features that differ from my old Samsung S4.  I need to add thirty characters to make this an acceptable review.  Stupid.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150548712,Veryy similar to my last phone.,2017-02-11T21:48:28.000+00:00,5,I like the phone but the volume for me is to low and seem to have less ring tones choices. Didn't take me long to get use to it.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,150435796,Android all the way,2017-02-11T00:29:13.000+00:00,5,Moved to Verizon after a long time with AT&T. Very happy so far with coverage. Love my new Moto Droid Z. Still playing with all the features but love Android.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150398267,Great Phone!,2017-02-10T20:02:35.000+00:00,4,I like the new Moto Z droid alot!

I guess time will tell if holds up.

The camera quality is wonderful and I can multitask with multiple apps running at once with no problem in performance. Only draw back is the battery life, but if you keep apps closed then that helps"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150371578,Good phone,2017-02-10T14:34:10.000+00:00,4,Phone sync's with my spouses - don't care for that.  Wish that could be kept separate. otherwise it's okay.

Fantastic!,2017-02-09T22:25:05.000+00:00,5,I haven't had a cellphone in 15 years so this is my first one.  I didn't have any problems getting it working and using it right away.  I'm very happy with it.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,150200875,Transition was super easy.,2017-02-09T02:47:29.000+00:00,5,"Great features, great camera...Sound is good...Looks and feels great!
Droid is ""Z"" greatest phone so far. ...Better than that fruit phone! Lol"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150189784,"Not as easy of transition, pre installed apps that charge misleading",2017-02-08T23:54:31.000+00:00,3,Challenging to find correct texting and voicemail apps. Pre installed apps want to charge a service fee to use. Camera functions slow. Most base phone apps don't have settings in app to customize. Size is a little large for my hand. Calls sound tinny.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150185976,droid z white,2017-02-08T23:14:35.000+00:00,4,i like the speed of the phone battery life is good i feel it could use more storage space or to be able to use the SD better idk over all A-
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150171907,It is not an easy transition from my Samsumg Galaxys4mini,2017-02-08T21:03:49.000+00:00,3,"I bought this phone because of the price.  The fast processing is fine. It runs my business Apps that I need to have.  I HATE that I cannot transfer my music as easily as I did on my Samsung.  I STILL DO NOT have a way to play the music.  I have to download an App to  do that.  Samsung provided an available app.  Also, HATE the phone does not come USB connector ready, or have a built-in ear phone jack."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,150171492,Great value,2017-02-08T20:56:36.000+00:00,4,"Fantastic graphics,flash for camera is much better than my previous phone. Easy to set up and transfer data. Love how fast it charges."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,150002867,"Good phone, although each new iteration has a learning curve",2017-02-06T22:42:46.000+00:00,4,"As I'm now used to it, I like it quite a bit.  The screen is really large, but the width dimension is similar to my older phone, so it still fits into pockets that the old one fit into. There have been almost daily system updates, which is getting old... but I'm sure that will eventually end. It is an improvement over my old phone, which was a good phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149997001,Getting Aquainted,2017-02-06T21:54:21.000+00:00,5,Switch from iPhone to Android - very happy - size of phone makes it easy to read - like touch screen where you can preview messages.  Sound quality when talking on the phone much improved
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149963419,Great,2017-02-06T17:20:04.000+00:00,5,The phone is amazing but idk it keeps turning on and off same thing with the speakers but other than that the phone is amazing I love it I had an iPhone I don't think I would go back to the Iphone any time soon i love my moto
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149882060,"Great phone, works great.",2017-02-05T21:57:40.000+00:00,5,"This phone is fast and easily programmable. It is very thin and light weight. With the expand-ability of the clip on options, this phone can do so much more."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149870802,Nice phone!!,2017-02-05T20:37:39.000+00:00,5,"This phone is pretty nice...So far I like it. I love the service, the price, and overall experience with Verizon!!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149848671,Overall it's an excellent phone.,2017-02-05T17:50:58.000+00:00,5,The only problem I've noticed about this phone is it's tendency to drop it's Wi-Fi connection. Other than that. I'm very pleased. A great phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149839557,"Seems okay after first week, with three system updates in the first days",2017-02-05T16:09:57.000+00:00,4,"The Motorola Droid and Android system are keeping up with the times and providing a competitive choice for the Apple products, which the rest of my family prefer.   

The Moto Force upgrade was offered at a special half-price (now apparently being reduced even further) so that made the move a smart one on my part.

Something is always lost in the transition and it took me a few days to bring my new phone up to the comfort level of my old one, downloading the dozens of apps that did not get delivered from the ""cloud"" (during the activation) and learning on my own how to transfer the ringtones from my old phone, via a bluetooth connection. 

Now the phone seems to be working well, perhaps a little faster than the old one, with sharper videos and photos. The bothersome promotions for Verizon add-ons and other products are about to end so I can settle into just using the phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149779078,great phone,2017-02-05T00:22:03.000+00:00,4,"As a new user of a smartphone, it is a little overwhelming and We do not have our grandkids to help us.  We are slowly overcoming all the phone's capabilities."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149759855,Nothing works right,2017-02-04T21:46:30.000+00:00,2,"Most of my apps timeout after 5 minutes ( Amazon Music,etc. Always in driving mode cannot answer phone. always updating."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149597712,Best phone I have had since my blackberry!,2017-02-03T22:06:09.000+00:00,5,"The Moto z droid is my new favorite phone. The graphics on it are amazing in every game. It also has great speed in its processing so that it doesn't hang up on random apps. The bonus to all of it is the attachments that you can get, I can't wait to get my projector. I have heard nothing but good things."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149596971,very different,2017-02-03T21:57:19.000+00:00,3,no instructions and everything is different than my old droid max. having a very hardtime trying to figure out how to do the basic functions.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149593461,Love my new phone,2017-02-03T21:16:02.000+00:00,5,I love how the phone runs with no problems whatsoever.  I will be getting my wife the same phone because of how much I enjoy mine.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149591553,Not a huge fan,2017-02-03T20:53:08.000+00:00,2,Camera isn't the best. I don't like that there isn't a home button. Also not a fan of gold but they were out of black. I like the screen size.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149589440,Good phone.,2017-02-03T20:29:08.000+00:00,4,Once learned how to use this phone is  pretty easy to manage. Down side is no head phone jack for ear buds. have to Bluetooth or use cable provided
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149589051,Think twice,2017-02-03T20:24:59.000+00:00,1,I've always had Motorola but this phone by far is the worst. The battery may charge fast but who cares when it sucks the life out of battery just as fast. Can't have all the apps on this phone like other phones I've had. Can't turn the text notification down because it's same volume as ringer not separate. First day I had to do a factory reset. Should have gone to an iPhone as much as I am against it. Motorola going downhill.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149588737,Can't send texts,2017-02-03T20:21:34.000+00:00,3,New phone seems okay but the gallery doesn't work like my last Moto and the photos don't send in normal texts and then my phone is sending messages only sometimes most stay in que and never are delivered. Bummer
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149434937,having trouble just answering phone.,2017-02-02T14:16:21.000+00:00,3,I don't likee that Facebook or whoever beeps every time there is an announcement.  Don't know how to cancel the beeps.  Will get help when I see my grandson.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149431231,Moto Z Droid,2017-02-02T12:39:40.000+00:00,4,"Overall, I'm very happy with my new phone. I prefer androids and this model fits my needs (and wants)"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149161469,Can't be used as a remote control and it doesn't a pre-installed voice recorder,2017-01-31T20:33:29.000+00:00,4,Can't be used as a remote control and it doesn't a pre-installed voice recorder. Refer a calculator like the one in the LG3. Okay besides that it's a phone
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149161364,Love It,2017-01-31T20:32:48.000+00:00,5,Love this phone the advancement s that come with this phone are great and I love how u can change the phone the way u like
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149129917,Very nice!,2017-01-31T15:12:15.000+00:00,5,"Still learning how to use it.  My grandchildren are very helpful in teaching me!  So far, I am enjoying the learning how to use all the feat."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149118116,Great phone!,2017-01-31T12:03:26.000+00:00,4,"This phone is very light and thin, but has a large screen that is great for watching videos or reading. Easy to recommend!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149084427,Friendly,2017-01-31T01:24:35.000+00:00,5,Great service phone works great people was friendly they did everything help change over from Sprint thanks
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149078959,Not as good as a Turbo 2,2017-01-31T00:21:02.000+00:00,3,My Turbo 2 took a bath and I was gonna get another but couldn't find one. Was told this was comparable. Totally not. No wireless charging and very touchy keypad. Not happy.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,149078187,Not perfect,2017-01-31T00:13:56.000+00:00,4,It has been easy to get use to. I still haven't learned everything about the phone yet. The only thing I didn't like is it didn't come with accessories like the camera or speaker or a phone charger.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148998593,Phone is not user friendly.,2017-01-30T17:17:57.000+00:00,3,Come with no instructins and does not acess features like other previous systems have. No speed dial unless you count toughing a recent call as speed dial. Does not come with Message app and the contact feature is totally messed up. No ease of access.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148996685,good but not great...yet,2017-01-30T16:57:00.000+00:00,4,"I like the Z but I'm hoping (with time) I will love it. Some issues the arose since I bought it: continuous system updates, sometimes more than once in a day; some apps won't work that did work on previous smart phone; closing applications via the small square at the bottom of the screen -until the most recent update (number 6 or 7 now) I had to swipe every single app to ""close/end"" it but now it offers the ""close all"" option at the top. I do wish I had the option for a smart case but that is probably being petty.

Pros: I very much like the fingerprint lock/unlock, love the option for mods (I haven't used one yet but plan to!), camera takes beautiful pictures, and sound clarity is superior. 

I did speak to a technician about the continuous updates and they recommended taking it back and getting a replacement (this was the third day I had it) but I haven't had a chance yet. Today is day 10 and the system updates have slowed down but still some technical issues from time to time. Other than that I am very glad I chose the Z droid!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148929651,Best phone yet. Great features and ease of use.,2017-01-30T01:13:35.000+00:00,5,Use my phone primarily for business and it meets or exceeds all requirements. This is my 6th or 7th smartphone and nothing I have had even begins to compare.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148890378,Reasonable Phone for the Price,2017-01-29T20:23:23.000+00:00,4,"My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy 4. This phone is much larger and utilizes the new USB ""C"" connection / charging unit so all of my cables from the past don't work anymore and I find that aggravating. Finally, there is no headphone jack and this trend of having to go to wireless earbuds is I also find bothersome. All of this being said, the phone itself delivers as it was advertised. Great price!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148813407,Easy transition to this phone from Droid Turbo,2017-01-29T12:49:30.000+00:00,4,I really like that I can add a memory card couldn't in the turbo. Moto Z does way to many updates though. I had it a week and it did 5 system updates. Battery life isn't as long as the Turbo either. It is a great size and wide viewing screen. Overall it is a good phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148708686,still learning about tje phone do not like the pop ups for enhanced verizon store visits dont need it,2017-01-28T22:23:43.000+00:00,4,data useage  used up to fast I like the size and it is easy to use sound is very good very clear no problems with this phone yet
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148679085,Sadone31,2017-01-28T18:37:54.000+00:00,5,"Overall a very fine phone,not enough battery storage.seems to be very durable,no issues so far  been a year a little spendy"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148201504,Great phone,2017-01-27T21:57:14.000+00:00,5,Easy transition. Easy to sync with my car and to get back on line with email and Facebook. Love the new red case.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148199027,"Very similar transition from my previous phone, Samsung",2017-01-27T21:21:44.000+00:00,4,"It would be helpful if it had a built-in Notepad, capability of assigning different notification tones for contacts, social media and e-mail...as of now notifications are all the same tone..I have to check my phone each time it goes off to see what it is. Also would like a port to plug in headphones that I don't need a converter."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148197156,very frustrating phone,2017-01-27T20:59:14.000+00:00,1,"too many updates everyday is ridiculous, plus too many apps that I don't want or will use, guy at Verizon when I went back was very condescending to me and didn't get all my answers. If using an app very hard to answer phone screen keeps changing"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148195413,Good phone so far!,2017-01-27T20:44:51.000+00:00,4,"I am in a learning curve! This is my first smart phone, so I'm learning how to text, and, all the other features the phone has to offer. I am a little hard of hearing, and the sounds, even turned up to max is a some what soft..I'm trying to find out if it has a feature that the phone light's up to signal an incoming call,  text, or email, so far no luck. I've only had it for a week or so, but it is still a work in progress. I have not used the camera yet, and I hope it is great, as it was one of the main reasons I went to the smart phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148162093,Good and bad,2017-01-27T17:47:23.000+00:00,4,"There is not a cord to connect the phone to my computer.  What a misstep by design.  When changing things, make them better.  I can't use my ear phones and recharge the phone at the same time.  Why????  When transferring from one phone to another it screws up too many things.  Just transfer what is on the phone and don't try to be cutsie. I do like this phone better than my previous phone, but not every change is an  improvement.  Remember that not everyone is a techy and not everyone wants changes just to impress everyone that they can change the programs.  Have had major problems with the length of the charge of the battery."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,148033444,good features but call answering problem,2017-01-27T13:34:51.000+00:00,4,"Great phone except it will not let you answer 1/2 of the calls, goes to message, also one day it would not charge until it completely ran down."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147872155,Good cell phone reception.,2017-01-26T23:36:54.000+00:00,4,We've been Verizon customers for over 15 years. The service has always been reliable and customer service very good.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147845990,Nice size reading information,2017-01-26T20:49:31.000+00:00,3,"Don't like locked front screen. Tried to look up on how to get that off, and can't find the answer. Battery life is barely a day. Learning where to find information. Unhappy with the charging cord."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147820922,Disappointed,2017-01-26T15:10:00.000+00:00,2,Standard battery drains quickly on standby and worse after 2 phone calls. The ear speaker sound is terrible during phone calls. Overall temperature is hot when in a pocket. Some apps simply disappear.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147817636,Moto Z,2017-01-26T14:25:44.000+00:00,4,"Love my new phone! This is my 3rd Motorola Droid and couldn't be happier. One draw back about the phone, it does ring very loud. Even with ringer up all the way is not loud. Some might call that a plus, though."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147476537,Sound,2017-01-26T03:09:28.000+00:00,4,Nice phone so far but has a vibration when listening on the phone. Battery life seems lots shorter than the Droid Turbo I had.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147469405,Moto Z,2017-01-26T01:10:16.000+00:00,5,Easy to use. Great screen size. Good battery life. Needs a battery charge after 36 hours or so. Love the updates after purchase. Really made the phone work so much better.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147426254,Loooong battery life.,2017-01-25T12:31:01.000+00:00,5,Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.  Long battery life.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,147310072,Great phone with great features,2017-01-24T20:11:59.000+00:00,5,"The Moto Z has great features and it was easy to transfer the settings and data from my old phone.  When I needed to contact the Chat Room prior to ordering the phone, they were extremely helpful in answering my questions."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147307727,Transition,2017-01-24T19:58:20.000+00:00,1,The transition from the Galaxy S4 to the Moto Droid Z has been challenging even though they both are Android devices.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147300247,phone,2017-01-24T18:57:26.000+00:00,2,it iok why should I the thing will never change. I like to have chargers all over not take the same one all the time.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147240983,So far not impressed,2017-01-24T03:51:42.000+00:00,2,"My biggest complaint is the size. It's way too big just like the rest of them. I might as well hold my tablet up to my ear. The battery drains quickly and the charger is a joke. I can't use the charger in my car because the plug doesn't disconnect from a USB cable so I can't plug it into my car's USB port to charge which is necessary given the horrible battery life. The charger isn't travel friendly either because the prongs don't fold into itself to keep it from jabbing into everything in my bag. Near as I can tell, they don't even make a car charger for this phone. It seems technology is moving backwards."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147193847,Very easy to use.  Great pictures,2017-01-23T21:50:29.000+00:00,5,The phone is easy to use and maneuver through.  Any questions you van find right on the phone. Takes great pictures and videos
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147126488,Good phone,2017-01-23T17:38:59.000+00:00,5,It's a good phone but I miss the old phone that was 4 years old and also a droid. I don't think it's a lot of difference between them.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147021696,"Fast responses, no glitches. Very good battery for such a tin phone.",2017-01-22T23:56:28.000+00:00,5,I had Iphone 5 and Samsung Note and Galaxy This Moto Z is the best phone I ever had. Tin & powerful.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,147012696,Good phone,2017-01-22T23:46:13.000+00:00,5,I like the phone quite a bit. Still taking a while to get used to where everything is. I quite like the feature of double flipping or double shaking to get some features to come. Especially the flashlight.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,146900068,Great customer service.,2017-01-22T19:59:11.000+00:00,5,"The customer service really help me, they were very helpful and friendly. Really helpful. Had all the answers to my question."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,146176901,I only own Droid's!,2017-01-21T20:53:02.000+00:00,3,I love the phone. I just do not understand why the notification volume is tied into the volume. I had to block most of mine to have my volume up full.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,146096854,Great phone and cool extras,2017-01-21T19:49:02.000+00:00,5,"Enjoyed getting back to the moto from a Samsung Galaxy. All the great things I lovedo about the moto x plus the projector that can be attached to the back, battery pack, and more."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,144439822,Hate,2017-01-20T04:23:51.000+00:00,1,Phones screen constantly turns on when something get near it and kills the battery. Did not realize there was no head phone jack. Speaker mod isnot loud enough to for anything
Motorola Moto Z Droid,144437926,I thought it was shatter resistant,2017-01-20T03:55:50.000+00:00,4,"The phone is great. The screen is large, and the high definition looks like it's high definition. However, the first time I dropped the phone, the screen cracked. The sales agent told me it was shatter resistant. When I took it back to the sales agent he was incredibly surprised. The phone charges fast and the battery seems to drain fast."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,144401140,Nice upgrade from Moto X - except for size,2017-01-19T22:40:30.000+00:00,4,"Upgraded to the ""Z"" since I had the ""X."" Smooth transition as the software is pretty much the same. The size is the only bad thing. It is 5.5 inches and stretches the thumb muscles when holding it. The ""X"" was the perfect size. Also do not like that there is no holster with a clip on it for this phone. I use the Map My Walk app and clipping my phone to a pocket was perfect. Over all a good phone and will not be returning it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,144389543,Luv phone!!,2017-01-19T20:45:05.000+00:00,5,This phone is great it has great features.. design .. Light weight..  Easy to use..  I am very pleased w this phone..  Wish I could have purchased sooner..
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143949128,Droid Moto Z,2017-01-16T01:10:26.000+00:00,4,I bought this a few days before Christmas when the charger port quit working.The young man who helped me was very knowledgeable and helped me get a phone as similar to my onld phone as possible.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143904328,Moto x,2017-01-15T22:23:51.000+00:00,2,"Not too thrilled with this phone 
Wish my old Samsung note 4 had benn more waterproof 
And this is too expensive"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143896421,So so,2017-01-15T21:27:29.000+00:00,3,"Email links do not forward or open tab to link. Still trying it out. Battery life is only a little over 12 hours not the advertised 40, not any better than my old phone. May not keep it based on above."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143523677,"Fast, Amazing Battery, Great Design.",2017-01-13T07:43:00.000+00:00,5,"Haven't had this phone very long, but it's already my favorite! By far the fastest phone I have ever used. The battery life is amazing no longer have to carry a phone charger on me at all times. The screen is the perfect size, takes great pictures. I haven't had the chance to use any of the Moto Mods yet but the phone by itself is perfect."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143450866,Battery life worse than a five year old phone!,2017-01-12T20:50:47.000+00:00,1,I got two of these and both have miserable battery life which was the primary reason I was upgrading from phones my wife and I have had for many years.  With absolutely no usage the battery loses it's charge completely in less than a day.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143328938,Big mistake,2017-01-12T04:24:52.000+00:00,3,"Wanted a good phone with good service and was told this phone had dual antennas and was excellent for the area I lived in. That is a joke, continually have lost calls or can not make a call. I will say that camera is about the only thing on phone that has been true to it's word."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143317403,Glad I got it!,2017-01-11T23:01:29.000+00:00,5,I'm still learning all of the features on my phone but really enjoy the larger screen and the ease of going from one app to the next. I'm really glad I decided to upgrade!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143315479,Great Phone.......WHEN IT WORKS,2017-01-11T22:14:06.000+00:00,3,This phone is great except for the fact that the LCD breaks if you look at it wrong. I've had my phone since august and since then I have had to replace the LCD 4 times. One of those times was my fault I dropped my phone that one time but the other 3 I've just woken up and the screen wasn't functional. Also I am extremely unhappy with Motorola's customer service. They have lost me as a customer. If you do get this phone do yourself a favor and get the insurance plan with Verizon so that you DON'T have to deal with Motorola
Motorola Moto Z Droid,143279604,Almost perfect,2017-01-11T21:12:56.000+00:00,4,"This phone is great but I noticed the touch screen isn't always that sensitive. Sometimes I have to tap something several times for it to work. Also, there have been a few occasions where the screen acts funny. It will oscillate rapidly between a couple different displays like it's malfunctioning."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142949459,IT wont stop freezing,2017-01-11T15:12:54.000+00:00,1,I got this phone dec 23rd and I am about to say officially I hate it! It keeps freezing and my Bluetooth will not connect or work with anything!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142926372,Nothing good about it,2017-01-10T23:21:38.000+00:00,1,"I got it because I was told it was the most durable. Considering how many times the back has popped off, I really don't consider this phone durable. And the battery has to be charged at least twice a day, which is very unexpected for me considering I use this phone less than the Turbo I replaced & barely charged it once a day. I also don't like the size; it's too big."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142924666,New likes,2017-01-10T22:39:40.000+00:00,3,I have had about a week. The only thing I don't like is the text messaging. The ring tone only plays a few bars of the tone
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142920312,"Great camera, not so great battery",2017-01-10T21:03:35.000+00:00,3,"I like the size of the phone and the camera, but the battery doesn't always charge properly. It will be plugged in but does not read the original charger. I also do not like the fact the charging cord is an actual plug (not adapter and cord like other phones)....makes traveling with in car, airplanes, etc a hassle"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142735060,Moto Z Droid,2017-01-09T15:36:28.000+00:00,3,"This phone is a little more complex for me than my Moto Y so it's been slower to use for me.  The original phone I received had to be returned to Verizon after an update left it in a ""bootloader loop""."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142521225,Missing key apps,2017-01-08T20:08:51.000+00:00,4,"It's a perfectly nice phone. It functions as expected. I like that it has 4gb of ram. But what's missing is a bit in note pad, music player, and photo gallery. I have to get these through Google Play store and they all come with ads. Very annoying."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142484013,Problems,2017-01-08T15:00:40.000+00:00,1,"Have had problems with this phone since I got it. First people couldn't hear me when I called them or when they called me.  Then the touch buttons wouldn't work. Then I couldn't hear people, when on blue tooth.  Tried to return it, but it was too late.  Got it at Best Buy.  They did not match Verizon's extended return holiday policy.I had been told they did, but Verizon was wrong, because when I tried to return it to Best Buy, they said only 14 days on cell phones, period.  I will never buy another phone from Best Buy again. I am stuck with this phone for 2 years."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142478377,Best phone ever owned! Love it!,2017-01-08T14:02:01.000+00:00,5,I bought this phone over two months ago. It a birthday gift to myself. Best decision ever!  Love the ease of use and the battery life is phenomenal! Everything you could want in a phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142475514,Underwhelmed,2017-01-08T13:16:31.000+00:00,2,"For all the hype smart phones get, I expected a lot more when I purchased my first one.  My Yahoo! e-mail is not compatible with the Android operating system.  And speaking of the OS, I get almost-daily system ""upgrades"" that shut down my phone for up to half an hour.  Every time I turn around, the phone is asking me to track my location, which is very distracting and unnecessary.  So far the only application I have downloaded is Facebook, and the newsfeed is horrendously fragmented.  It doesn't work anything like the regular web site.  I don't know if this is due to the Android OS or the application, but either way it's not very friendly."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142339862,Wish I could get help with this phone,2017-01-08T03:51:24.000+00:00,1,"This phone is way too Googled for me to enjoy.  Third auto update locked it up with Moto voice error which I don't use.  Had to factory reset.  No photo gallery, wants them on Google cloud apparently.  And Google search  bar cannot taken off every page.  Beyond intrusive, do that many people want the photos stored off their phones?  Do that many people not feel like idiots talking to inanimate objects to operate them?  Using what little free time I have trying to learn how to go back to how my droid x operated."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142308678,Great phone,2017-01-07T23:59:34.000+00:00,5,"I'm glad my previous phone, an LG G3, bit the dust.  I've been looking for a valid reason to get a new, fancy phone. I've had my Moto Z Droid for a week and I'm loving it. It is very slim, fast, looks cool and has a gorgeous screen. I bought the JBL speaker mod, which sounds decent and works well. I'm considering getting the zoom camera mod next.  The turbo battery charger is super fast."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142285933,Too big. No headphone jack,2017-01-07T20:20:40.000+00:00,3,"The phone is fast and has nice features, but it's too big to fit in to any pocket and I hate that it does not have a headphone jack. Honestly. Thinking of returning it"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142209003,Love Hate Relationship,2017-01-06T19:57:15.000+00:00,4,"I have been using the Moto Z for about 3 weeks now. I got it as a replacement for my first gen Moto X. First, this phone is huge. Unlike the Moto X which had a gorgeous, hand-fitting form factor, this thing is big and flat. I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it for that reason; it doesn't fit in any pocket, and is hard to dial with one hand. I decided to give it a trial, though, because I do love Moto, and really didn't want an iPhone or Samsung. So I nicknamed it ""Toast,"" since it is like talking on a piece of toast. Day 1, I drive to work, and when it wouldn't fit in cup holder, I put it in another slot near me. First time I hit the brakes, Giant phone flies out of the slot, on to the floor. I am aggravated--Toast was toast. I was going to return it at the very next opportunity. But as I continued to use it that day, we continued to bond: it's large screen, a gift to my presbyopic eyes, the wrist-twist camera feature I can't live without, and how it talks to me while I am driving...Well, it was hard to figure out just what phone I would trade it in for if I did return it. I could go back to Moto X small, but after a few weeks with my new friend, I'd have a hard time with those tiny little icons. Bottom line, I decided to keep it, and BTW, LOVE my red Incipio Dualpro case, which gives it a slightly metallic, space age look. I hope that Moto comes out with a slightly smaller phone soon, and that will be a happy medium. Until then, a toast to Toast!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142092346,trading it in ASAP,2017-01-05T18:34:54.000+00:00,1,"I got this when I needed to quickly replace the Turbo1 I had dropped and the display separated from the screen [but the glass didn't crack!]. I need something durable and this was suggested by the salesman. I don't like that it's larger than the phone I had.  But more than that, I HATE that the back keeps coming off. I've already nearly lost it at least 3 times. The only reason to get this phone is if you'll use the Mods *frequently*. I also don't like the fingerprint reader. I like the idea of it, but, like many other people, I keep trying to use it to get to the home screen. In this day of multi-purpose, it's stupid to have a button only exist for 1 reason, especially when people might not even use the feature."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,142011929,"Constantly updating, short battery life, different charger!",2017-01-04T19:23:35.000+00:00,2,"I bought this phone after my Droid Turbo screen was seriously damaged since it was basically a newer version of the same phone.  So far I am disappointed as the battery doesn't last very long, and nearly every day it is requiring a 20 min ""update""!  Also, despite being just another Motorola Droid style phone, it requires a different charger than my Droid Turbo, so now I will have the additional cost of buying another car charger and charger to leave at work!  Other than that, it is basically the same phone with a few different features or slight variance to the looks of the old Turbo."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141946291,Terrible battery life,2017-01-04T05:22:11.000+00:00,2,"Battery drains fast! Even took it back to the Verizon kiosk and he suggested turning battery saver on, turn off Bluetooth and location. It still drained down. It's fully charged when I go to work and I don't even use it until I go to lunch. By then it's usually about 30% left. If it continues, I will want an exchange."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141833286,Great phone but notification volume is TERRIBLE,2017-01-03T00:20:45.000+00:00,3,The phone is nice and works good but it's hard getting over the notifications not being loud at all.  Its set at highest volume and sounds like my old phones lowest volume.  Texts come through and I never hear them.  Frustrating and may have to leave this phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141824570,yes,2017-01-02T23:19:06.000+00:00,5,it is easy phone to use

Motorola Moto Z Droid,141758576,Still learning; love the size!,2017-01-02T15:39:12.000+00:00,5,Much easier to find in my purse; keyboard for texting is better than my old phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141732382,It fast and cool but...,2017-01-02T02:14:54.000+00:00,3,So it's a pretty sweet phone I gotta admit. But the battery life is horrible. If I do anything I'll have to charge it every hour and a half to two hours which is ridiculous. I don't even think it'll last a full day without a charge.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141706448,Don't like the google and photo process and when talking the other end sounds fuzzy,2017-01-01T20:40:32.000+00:00,3,Tried to download pictures and only half of them downloaded.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,141618094,Great phone,2016-12-31T21:30:21.000+00:00,4,"I bought the Moto Z phone right about 1 week ago. I love the camera and the video which I had told the guys at the store were most important to me. I also like how sensitive the screen is and the movement features.

 I do not like some of the messaging features. The keyboard is not as easy to use as the Galaxy I had before. I also liked the short cuts better for messaging favorites on my Galaxy."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141614555,Not thrilled yet,2016-12-31T20:48:41.000+00:00,3,"Bought this phone under duress after my Droid Turbo took a bath.

Took a little adjustment to get use to some functional differences but overall very happy with my decision, Great camera, quick process/operation slim size with a very nice 5.5"" screen. I would and have recommend this phone to friends!"

Had an LG lucid 2 I was going to activate to establish a new # for myself. The associate at the Verizon store showed me the special going for Christmas and the difference in monthly expenses was 11 dollars more than originally budgeted. So glad I upgraded.

One thing I would mention though is that the Moto Z doesn't seem to keep the battery power quite as long as the old Moto Droid. It may be because I play many games on it which I didn't play on the old Moto Droid."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,141374727,Pathetic battery life,2016-12-29T21:11:42.000+00:00,3,Cell phone is nice enough but a battery hog. Screen brightness is less than my 2 year old Moto G. Moto actions are nice.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141270261,"Too ""touchy"" of a screen",2016-12-29T04:08:31.000+00:00,1,"I've had this (my FIRST EVER) Smartphone for 10 days now. I don't understand the big deal. By the time I get to the correct screen to do, what I need to do, I could have performed the task THREE times already, with my basic flip phone. All  I have to do is breathe, by the phone, and it changes screens!!! I don't like it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141250032,"Beautiful, versatile, powerful",2016-12-28T22:16:11.000+00:00,5,"I love this phone.  It's very fast, it's powerful, it doesn't come with a lot of unwanted programs that you can't uninstall.  The modular components are just icing on the cake since the phone can really stand along without them.  I got the battery pack mod and I really like how it can be setup to float the main battery at 80%.  It lasts really long that way.  I don't have a case on the phone right now and I've dropped it a few times without any damage.  Seems to be very well made and sturdy.  The screen resolution is pretty amazing, all my photos and games look incredible."

I feel more secure with this phone than any in the past, and there have been many.  I have had three Motorola phone over the past 22 years, and feel they are the best cell phones I've had."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,141119493,Straightforward transition from LG Android phone,2016-12-28T00:00:02.000+00:00,4,"This was a gift, to replace an LG phone on its last legs. Between the Google account restore process and the Verizon Cloud backup it was pretty easy to get all the contacts, SMS messages, phone call history, and media moved to the new phone. So far it's great; bigger screen, better camera, and a much better telephone (some smartphones are pretty good computers but not much as far a  phone goes). The Moto phones are pretty solid."

The battery life is amazing! I charged it to 100% about 10 a.m. on Friday, left work in vegas about noon, used the navigation on and off during my drive to LA and made a few phone calls and I didn't even reach below 20% when I charged it it the next morning at 10 a.m.!"

I knew it was going to be a good phone because I've always had good luck with Moto, but this one is far better than I'd hoped for.  The battery life is the best I've ever had in a smart phone, but the real eye opener was the call quality.  I've had people ask if I'd gotten a new phone because the call quality was clear and strong.  From my end, the earpiece is excellent (and I have moderate tinnitus).  The processor is strong and responses from apps are very quick.  The screen is large and easy to see, touch is sharp and responsive and the case is thin so it doesn't feel like I'm carrying a brick or a potato.  Overall, the phone is very intuitive and easy to use.  I've been carrying mobile phones for twenty-five years and this is probably the best I've had."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,140848980,Worst phone ever,2016-12-26T01:17:47.000+00:00,1,I wouldn't recommend

Only problems I can see is the lack of a headphone jack which I can learn to live without. I've tried an adapter off Amazon and it works so I'll just need to keep a few spares around. Only other issue is the inability to rearrange the navigation buttons like I could on my LG. I wish Google would get with the program on that, it's an easy fix!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,140840928,Initial problem with camera dropped rating,2016-12-25T22:12:37.000+00:00,3,"The second day l had the phone the camera stopped working and asked me to restart the camera app. This appears to be an existing problem with this phone which does not yet have a good diagnosis or answer. I had to do a complete factory reset to get access to the camera again. I'm currently hanging onto my old phone in case I have to return the new one. I also had difficulties backing up my old phone onto my new one, but that's probably mostly on me. I'll try to return and edit this as I learn more."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,140840034,So many new features!,2016-12-25T21:57:10.000+00:00,5,"Bought just over a week ago, can finally update my apps and see what I've been missing! Battery life isn't as great as I wish it would be, but still ALOT better than my old phone!"

I was looking at the Google phone as it is manufactured by HTC but ultimately decided on the Moto Z droid. I have never had a motorola phone but it is made by Lenovo which made me decide to go with it instead of the Samsung. It is a great phone, extra slim design, fast charging, super clear photos and functionality is so easy. I got the Moto Z Droid Play for my daughter, let's see how she likes after she opens it tomorrow..."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,140565748,It's no Samsung,2016-12-23T21:03:03.000+00:00,4,"I have had the phone for a week. It's no Samsung that's for sure. For 9.99 a month and with the mods I am still happy. With the battery mod with 3000 mAh battery you can 
play 8 hours straight. Projecter is pretty cool on battery power about 2.5 hours plugged in watch forever. JBL speakers are cool 10 battery life again plugged in forever. All in all the motto z is a cool phone with all the mods"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,140565716,Nice phone,2016-12-23T21:02:32.000+00:00,5,Really like it works great phone calls are clear battery lasts more than all day. So just have the speaker mode looking forward to the next new modes in the near future.

That is no longer the case and wish I had never gotten a moto phone. This phone is now locking up. What do I mean? It freezes! The screen will stay black even with the phone on. And if it does light up its covered in these weird colored streaked lines that cover the whole screen. Its like this right now. It might come back and work for a little while correctly like it has before when it done this but who knows and if it does for how long. This truly is the WORST phone I have ever had in my life. It is nothing but a expensive paper weight to me now!"

Motorola Moto Z Droid,139858714,More features but more steps than the Samsung Galaxy,2016-12-19T00:04:12.000+00:00,3,"I went to the Verizon store to get a new Samsung, but the salesperson said that they did not carry many Samsung phones because of the recent bad publicity. I said that I just wanted a phone. Then the salesperson said that the Moto was superior to the Samsung. I think the Moto is competitive but not superior. For example, if you want to make a long telephone call you cannot use your earphones because they use the same port (USB C) as the charger cable. Also you cannot use earphones without an adapter cable. I still have figured out how to save pictures and music. Must I buy another cable? The charger is one piece. I cannot disconnect the plug and attach the cable to my laptop. The Moto is not a cell phone. It is a portable computer with telephone capabilities. I go through more steps before I can actually key in a telephone number than with the Samsung. Motorola must be providing rebates to Verizon that Samsung does not provide."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139729306,Poor battery life,2016-12-18T02:39:44.000+00:00,4,But this phone 4 days ago awful battery life love every feature about the phone except for that
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139705470,Great phone,2016-12-17T19:50:04.000+00:00,4,"I've had this phone for a little over a week now with no issues. My only thing I dislike about it is that it doesn't have a headphone jack and has to have an adaptor for it in the charging port. It's kind of annoying. Other than that I love the camera, it takes amazing quality pictures."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139595919,"Excellent picture, sound quality and mods",2016-12-16T20:04:46.000+00:00,5,"Very cyberpunk with the mods on it, but that being said these are not the selling point of the phone. It is good without them, but they do add to its versatility and overall life thanks to each mod having its own chargeable battery. I love the picture, weight and size of this phone as it fits me and I am not one to carry a 'portable tablet' as many people are prone to do nowadays."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139441548,Larger screen was one of the features,2016-12-15T21:20:48.000+00:00,5,this phone is easy to use and has a great camera
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139440579,Just don't!,2016-12-15T21:04:41.000+00:00,1,"I've had phones since the days of bag phones, and all I can say about the Moto is just DON'T! I experienced 5 days of pure frustration until I could get to Verizon to exchange for the iPhone 6s. Phone wouldn't activate out of the box, refused to allow access to the cloud, attempted for 4 days straight to install a Moto upgrade (29 hours to download notice and it never did) , refused to recognize any wireless and would churn and churn and churn attempting the simplest applications. After 7 total hours on the phone with tech support I gave up! Battery life never lasted longer than 3 hours and I would literally watch the percentage drain before my eyes with limited to no use. Worst piece of garbage ever invented plus it would get HOT within minutes of use. With so many other options available, find one!! Epic fail Droid"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139313323,exelent phone,2016-12-14T23:41:15.000+00:00,5,very happy with this phone works great ezelent features

Motorola Moto Z Droid,139301579,Great phone!,2016-12-14T20:02:08.000+00:00,4,"Changed from iPhone to moto z because I liked the option of being able to use a micro SD card to increase my storage capability.  Yes, the learning curve was amazing!  Still learning after 2 weeks.  Over all the phone is great.  It's fast and intuitive.  Waiting for an update that will fix a notification alert volume issue. Not sorry I have this phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139229205,Great price for a flagship phone what's not to like,2016-12-14T16:12:33.000+00:00,5,The moto Z provides you with the thinnest form factor while still providing great battery life and performance.  I love the form factor with the moto mods that give you the option of creating a phone that is truly unique and one of a kind.  Great phone!!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139182518,Good product,2016-12-13T22:54:41.000+00:00,5,Very good service would recommend
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139170560,Great. Few changes,2016-12-13T20:40:23.000+00:00,4,I changed a couple of weeks ago. Doing alright. Few changes
Motorola Moto Z Droid,139091305,Excellent!,2016-12-13T13:59:11.000+00:00,5,I have this phone for about two weeks. Have always liked the Motorola droid phones since they have the best battery life that I've ever seen. I can go 2-3 days without charging. And the Moto mods are super cool. I have the JBL speaker mod and it is great. Love that the glass is shatterproof too.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138969172,"Fast processor, good display",2016-12-12T14:12:16.000+00:00,5,"Had for a week, good features, nice size. Expandable."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138915300,The camera the features everything is great,2016-12-11T19:24:46.000+00:00,5,I bought this phone a few weeks ago and this phone is awesome
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138823938,Droidmotoz,2016-12-10T23:13:25.000+00:00,4,"Like the phone, not the price, but so far it's better that the LG4 I had...it was a piece of dung."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138808724,Awesome phone!,2016-12-10T19:41:40.000+00:00,5,"Bought two a few days ago and very happy.  There are some drawbacks, such as the phone being so large you cannot use it with one hand. Also, no headphone jack. Another thing, the USB port is different from other Android phones.  It's such an awesome phone, we can overcome these challenges."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138556142,Easy to use,2016-12-09T12:59:19.000+00:00,5,I transitioned from an iphone and fine this phone much easier to operate.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138548437,I like it.,2016-12-09T04:26:56.000+00:00,5,Very thin and light weight.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138548427,OK phone,2016-12-09T04:26:36.000+00:00,3,I've had it a couple weeks. Battery drains quickly and touch screen is intermittent. Not 100% happy.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138484584,Great feature's,2016-12-08T21:22:28.000+00:00,5,"And a great deal,thanks"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138456555,not the best phone,2016-12-08T18:28:06.000+00:00,1,phone is really big and will not git in a standard jean pocket. no headphone jack so you have to purchase wireless headphones to listen to music. not user friendly... especially when trying to operate the phone with one hand.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138384684,Awesome,2016-12-08T15:02:15.000+00:00,4,"love my phone, never lags and the battery power is great. no complaints so glad I made the switch"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138381676,"Yes, I said 5 stars for the Moto Z!",2016-12-08T14:32:21.000+00:00,5,"The Moto Z Droid is a fabulous phone and it rocks on Verizon's service.  I'm impressed with the speed of the network.  I'm getting up to 65 Mbps download speeds on this phone.  Wow!

The phone is very responsive and fast in everything it does (i.e. loading apps, webpages, etc.)  It seems that apps just ""snap"" to the forefront when loading.  I don't see the lag I've gotten in the past.

Battery life?  That was my concern because the Moto Z has so much less battery life than it's brethren, the Moto Z Force and Moto Z Play.  At 2600 ma/hr  it is lasting me the whole day most every day.  I keep the quick charger in my office on my desk.  I rarely have used it to top off and tend to have at least 60% remaining at the end of my work day.  I have been using the phone more than I ordinarily might because it's new and I've been taking time to set it up the way I like it.

I also bought a couple of battery mods so if it's every an issue because I have to drop everything and run I have the Incipio slim 2200 mah battery mod and the bigger 3000 mah Mod from Mophie.  With that on hand anyone should be able to get through a whole day with the heaviest use.

The phone looks good and my son loves the thinness.  He marveled at how much thinner it is than his Apple 7 plus.  I bought my wife one the same day and her workmates are remarking how classy the device looks.  Her's is wrapped in the Kate Spade case for protection but, it really looks great on the phone.

I hope this helps those of you trying to make a decision.  I really like the phone a lot.  It's as close to plain android as you can get without going to the Google Pixel or a Nexus.  Matter of fact I received the latest update to Android 7 - Noughat within days of purchase.  I recevied Android 7 before the Nexus phones received there's from Google.  Amazing!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138350400,Easy change over from old phone,2016-12-07T22:57:13.000+00:00,5,Great phone easy to use
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138338091,Easy to use,2016-12-07T21:20:38.000+00:00,4,"I used to have a Samsung 6, but now have the Moto, and it was an easy transition. However, one thing I do not like is that it is necessary to have an adapter to plug in headphones as there is no headphone jack."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138231313,I prefer Motorola Android.,2016-12-06T22:26:09.000+00:00,5,Since I started buying smartphones I have always bought Motorola Androids. They're the best phones in my opinion and the Moto Z is definitely the best one so far.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138231253,I think mine has a glitch,2016-12-06T22:25:04.000+00:00,3,I am pretty sure mine has a glitch the speaker takes awhile to send sound out. 1 in 5 calls I can't hear unless they call. When I am watching a video I have to go into settings to turn the volume down. The volume down button on the side just turns my phone volume down not the video volume.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138230603,Cool Devicr,2016-12-06T22:11:31.000+00:00,4,"Great phone, good features, great feel and size.  Not flimsy and very responsive.  Google Now is driving me crazy!  It responds to external voices like during the National Anthem at ballgame, conversation with my wife, etc.  Then when you want it to work it will not respond."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138229579,Great Guestures/ Useful Lockscreen/ Love the Speaker Mod,2016-12-06T21:54:19.000+00:00,5,"Now that I've used the Motorola Pre-Lock Screen, I don't know that I could go back to another phone. It's so much faster to play and pause my music, or to quickly read my messages.

Being able to quickly turn on my flashlight or camera by merely moving the device, has proven immensely useful, again, I'm not sure how I could go back to another phone without this ease of access.

I got the JBL Speaker mod, it sounds great, gets mega loud, and sweetens the pot that much more. On top of that it's really snappy and the only non pixel group of phones to support Google Daydream (as of writing 12/06/2016)"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138107981,Great features,2016-12-05T23:52:12.000+00:00,4,I like it but the Bluetooth and wifi isn't too great they always cut out and Bluetooth never connects
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138088837,Like everything about new phone,2016-12-05T21:03:35.000+00:00,5,Got 2 weeks ago. Only issue is with trying to get Skype to work
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138064630,Terrible battery,2016-12-05T20:09:14.000+00:00,1,"Battery is only lasting 8 to 10 hours on a full charge with low to moderate use. No apps are left running. Location, ext. is off so I don't know why. Also blue tooth does not go into discovery mode"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138062243,All around great purchase,2016-12-05T19:51:23.000+00:00,5,"Love the volume, the large font and the great graphics on videos and movies...glad I have this phone"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138040141,Not too bad of a device,2016-12-05T18:03:56.000+00:00,4,I like this device - except that it consumes quite a bit of battery rather fast.  Mods are nice.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,138038487,Another Workhorse from Motorola,2016-12-05T17:54:39.000+00:00,4,"I switched to Motorola with my last smartphone purchase and haven't looked back. As a small business owner, I need battery life, durability and function, which Motorola excels at. The Moto Z is no different. I love the available mods and am looking forward to using the charger and speaker for extended battery life on the go and conference calls in the office. The Social Digest is a nice touch on this phone; it corrals all of your social media notifications into one place. The fast charger is fantastic!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137991234,Nice,2016-12-05T06:29:22.000+00:00,3,It's a bit big for me.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137987239,easy to use,2016-12-05T03:11:04.000+00:00,4,the volume could be louder
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137980938,New Phone Moto Z,2016-12-05T00:41:49.000+00:00,5,Awesome my old phone was starting to bomb out  every week and this one has gret memory and the battery life is excellent!!!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137964268,Overall a good phone with some disappointments.,2016-12-04T22:08:08.000+00:00,4,"I'm mostly satisfied but there are a few issues that greatly disappoint me.

They couldn't transfer my data as in previous versions so I must do it all step by step.
  
My previous phone would allow me to chose to view only contacts with a phone # listed in my google accounts.  Without that option I have a plethora of contacts with only email addresses that makes my contact list abominably long & annoying to use.  I also have an intense dislike for all phone numbers, addresses and notes that I've entered on a contact not showing up without hitting ""show all"".  That can still be forgotten and the wrong number dialed because one believes it's the only one there.

Every previous Droid could be plugged into my computer which allowed me to add photos or excel files easily to be accessed on the phone.  This phone will not show the folders or their structure.  Their method of adding photos pulls random photos from my hard drive with no apparent rhyme or reason.  I have tens of thousands of photos organized (my wife's and my family all the way back to the 1800s) on the computer but without the tree I can't find the dozen that I desire to keep with me.  

I despise not being able to load the old My Verizon Shared Data gauge/meter which I use regularly.  This may be a Verizon issue rather than a phone issue.

The battery life, bright screen and fast recharging are great pluses from all my past phones.  I would like to be able to place more icons (i.e. five across in a row) on the screens. and I also hate the home screen being on the left screen instead of the center screen.  All the apps one normally uses can fit on three screens.  If the home page is centered, one only needs to move one screen left or right depending on the type of app being sought.  This makes one retrain his muscle memory as well as having to concentrate more every time one looks for something."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137962722,Easy transition from old phone.,2016-12-04T21:53:37.000+00:00,5,Just received phone works great.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137962388,my droid max was a better phone easer to use,2016-12-04T21:50:48.000+00:00,1,Don't  like it as much as my droid max
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137959817,great phone,2016-12-04T21:27:30.000+00:00,4,this phone is great accept for the battery.  i wish moto used the largermoto z play droid for the moto z droid
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137956514,Very user friendly,2016-12-04T20:53:11.000+00:00,4,"I ordered this phone online, had a little issue getting it connected, but after it was connected it has been very similar operation to my droid turbo. I love the mods, the battery mod is so helpful, it charges the phone quickly and doesn't need to stay connected, it transfers power to the phone and then can be removed allowing you to reinstall a different mod."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137944347,Not happy,2016-12-04T20:36:10.000+00:00,2,My new phone is very glitchy.  Picture quality is no where near what I was told it would be.  Thought I would be soo happy but my droid Maxx is a better phone than this.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137931080,Glad to be back to Motorola,2016-12-04T20:23:23.000+00:00,5,Just bought this phone and truly happy to be back. Love my phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137897428,Really like the new phone !!,2016-12-04T19:29:56.000+00:00,4,"I've had this phone a few weeks, and the battery is great. I like it better than my Samsung."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137894271,Great features.  Durable and feels great in your hand.,2016-12-04T19:21:22.000+00:00,5,Great phone and network
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137856539,"Terrible, nothing works. I cannot perform any of the functions that I could on my Samsung phones.",2016-12-04T16:17:54.000+00:00,1,This phone is horrible and annoying. It does not perform any of the functions that my Samsung phones did. I am terribly dissapointed.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137804551,Not as simple as my HTC,2016-12-04T07:02:09.000+00:00,3,"Not really that happy with my new phone not very simple to use  as my last phone my and this will be my LAST phone on Verizon, since I had so many problems when buying it, all the new tec. is not for me, I made a big mistake buying a new phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137793523,great features,2016-12-04T01:49:10.000+00:00,5,Still trying to get used to this new phone. 1st smart phone. Only have had for 1 week.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137790179,Overall review.,2016-12-04T00:31:38.000+00:00,4,Over all the phone is great. I don't like the text messaging program. I don't particularly care for the way you have to delete call history. I really don't appreciate having 3-4 program upgrades. I understand these phones sit on a shelf until they are sold and program updates are needed as improvements are made after the phone is ready for market. What would be nice is to have them done all at 1 time.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137789159,Nice phone,2016-12-04T00:09:59.000+00:00,4,It seems to be a good phone...do miss some of the features of my LG phone...but am getting used to and enjoying the Moto Z.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137784860,"Style,great",2016-12-03T22:55:22.000+00:00,4,I'm happy w my buy . I had a G3 and this is a great upgrade.  Only complaints is the keyboard and camera selfies feature(none).
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137782236,Poor battery life,2016-12-03T22:29:15.000+00:00,2,"I got this on recommendation by Verizon guy, I wish I got the phone I went in for, I have 7 days left to either suck it up and keep it or get something else and dinged for whatever it costs to get something else.

The battery life is horrific and I am not a heavy cell phone user by any standard, it's mostly on standby, some texting, photo taking, use wi-fi or data about 30 minutes daily.  That being said, the battery will decline 30-40% within 12 hours.  My HTC with the same size battery could hold a decent charge for 4+ days with the same amount of use.  I don't understand.

I do like the motion sensor, it's very bright and Motorola has some nice features that Samsung and HTC do not, I'm still learning the phone.
I don't care about how thin it is, I'd much rather have a bigger battery.  Don't even try to sell me the ""battery mod"" either."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137780126,Ok,2016-12-03T21:58:52.000+00:00,4,"Great, but battery doesn't perform as well as what the specs said"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137768370,"Lots of features I'm still learning how to use. Not always easy, but think I'll figure all the features out.",2016-12-03T21:05:59.000+00:00,5,"Sooooo much better than my 4G LG I replaced. Love the picture quality, wish I could view the results of a picture on the same page as taken without having to exit, go to photos, and back again to attempt a better photo."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137764679,Am still getting used to it.,2016-12-03T20:24:49.000+00:00,4,I had trouble answering from the lock screen at first.  I miss the GPS tracker that was in my old phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137763156,Super fast & easy to use,2016-12-03T20:11:57.000+00:00,5,"Early Christmas present to myself, so happy I got it! Wonderful phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137760203,Great Phone,2016-12-03T19:50:39.000+00:00,5,I just got my phone this week.  And I love it. Easy to setup and use.  After all the updates everything works great. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137758092,Great phone! Easy transition from my Galaxy S5!,2016-12-03T19:47:21.000+00:00,5,"Has a great camera, and most features are the same as my S4."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137755781,Love it!!!,2016-12-03T19:28:07.000+00:00,5,"Easy to use, very clear pictures and video, loud speaker quality and battery life is great!!! Love it!!!"

Motorola Moto Z Droid,137512109,Won't stop rebooting,2016-12-02T00:31:47.000+00:00,1,"I bought 4 of these for Christmas gifts,  I gave one to my mother in law,  the phone is constantly rebooting,  now I have to go and return it,  not a happy customer. Possibly going to return the other 3 as well.  According to the Internet,  this is an issue."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,137103763,Great phone!,2016-12-01T20:54:31.000+00:00,5,Great battery life! Great photos!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136707882,"Great features, poor battery life",2016-12-01T02:17:57.000+00:00,4,"I am a long time Droid/Motorola user.  I love the slim sleek feel of this Moto X, but when they say 24 hour battery they exaggerated.  Thankfully, the phone charges quickly. 

Apps install and run well and I especially like the built in Moto apps. Good phone call audio and network connections. I've had the phone a week with no dropped calls."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136616128,Best phone Ever,2016-11-30T02:35:51.000+00:00,5,"This phone offers the level of security I require for work. Its slim, light and beautiful. As powerful as newest phones.Very Happy overall."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136615088,Very pleased with performance,2016-11-30T02:07:55.000+00:00,4,"Like most everything about the phone. Only negatives  are battery life, battery built into and if you use any add ons you can't use a case"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136597145,"Some things are better, some are not",2016-11-29T21:01:36.000+00:00,4,"I finally cracked the screen on my aging Razr Maxx, and had to replace it. This new Moto Z Droid a) has a bigger screen, b) runs much faster, c) charges very quickly.
But, on the downside, a) it lacks a separate notification LED to inform you of missed calls, incoming messages, etc, b) does not have a headphone jack (although an adapter cable is provided, but is a bit clumsy), c) is so thin that I fear that I will soon crack this even larger screen."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136551894,was a little harder transioning from my other phone tring to change the ring tones and gettig to my old messages,2016-11-29T14:38:27.000+00:00,4,like the little bigger screen and thinner  profile.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136539771,Very happy! Go Moto!,2016-11-29T03:47:35.000+00:00,5,"If you are tired of Apple & Samsung and need a change, this is it! 4GB ram, snapdragon 820. Expandable memory, and a very good camera. The Moto Mods are a bonus and really set this phone apart from the rest."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136525448,Love the new phone! Camera is better than my last one. VERY fast. it's great!,2016-11-28T22:44:15.000+00:00,5,I thought I'd cry if I didn't get the phone! But I was so happy when I bought it

Motorola Moto Z Droid,136478471,Not a good choice on my part,2016-11-28T16:17:49.000+00:00,1,"I tried to make the Moto Z work for me, but I miss my Samsung."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136448159,Not what I expected,2016-11-28T01:45:42.000+00:00,3,"Side buttons are small, no indicator light for incoming messages, and the phone is a bit longer than I wanted. The features that do come with it is great though."

The battery life is good, but was hoping of a more dramatic improvement from my previous phone. The good news is the turbo battery charge is very fast."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136351295,Love my new phone. A very easy transition from my old phone.,2016-11-26T22:49:18.000+00:00,5,I'm so very glad I bought this new phone. I love the fingerprint sensor to unlock it.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,136247534,Great phone,2016-11-25T19:35:20.000+00:00,5,Really nice phone runs really smoothly and everything is set up really nice too. It's super convenient features such as the touch pad that can turn my screen on or off helps out a lot too
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135879356,Really like it,2016-11-24T19:20:38.000+00:00,5,Was really a tough choice what I found that I like most about it is the mods even though they seem to be on a bit of the expensive side just love the idea of many tools
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135767864,Moto Z and Verizon,2016-11-24T02:56:09.000+00:00,4,Generally happy with the Moto z. Just realized that power cord does not have USB end on it that would allow direct hook up to my computer. Every other phone I've had offered this feature.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135657059,Good phone but...,2016-11-22T20:47:31.000+00:00,4,I bought this phone and would of liked a manual to go through all of the apps and set ups. Each phone is different.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135653496,No headphone jack,2016-11-22T19:58:12.000+00:00,3,Great phone other than I never noticed it doesnt have a headphone jack
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135652729,My review,2016-11-22T19:46:20.000+00:00,4,I am still learning about it but enjoying it so far.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135551122,"Everything is very good about this phone,except had problems with the Bluetooth not connecting. Had to reorder a new one.",2016-11-21T20:44:09.000+00:00,4,"Had problems with Verizon Cellular Sales not wanting to give me a new phone that they had in the store, because they already ordered one, so I was inconvenienced for a few days."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135542588,Ease of use.,2016-11-21T19:00:59.000+00:00,5,"My new Moto Z Droid is so easy to use. After everything was transferred I started using it. I reccomend getting the protective cover for it. It feels like it's not even there, besides you can never be too sure."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135427998,Moto x,2016-11-20T19:30:13.000+00:00,4,I needed a new phone
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135399321,a little over a week,2016-11-20T15:15:23.000+00:00,5,since only owning for a little over a week it is hard to fully review but as of now it seems to be feature rich.  thin and was very easy to begin using it has prompts to help you with the set up of each item. So far very pleased.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135391250,"Don't like the way the ""phone"" works.",2016-11-20T14:45:13.000+00:00,4,Way too much interaction to make the answer feature work smoothly. Way too many graphics get in the way. Other than that I like the other features. The camera on the phone is very good.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135324176,Don't know enough yet,2016-11-20T03:22:38.000+00:00,2,Still learning this phone.  Unfortunately no classes at my Verizon store until January.  Also am unable to synch the Bluetooth on my car.  not happy about that.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135315908,great phone,2016-11-20T00:39:57.000+00:00,5,had for it a close to 2 weeks.. clear sound.. no problems so far.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135293134,Easy transition from my old cell phone,2016-11-19T21:09:52.000+00:00,5,I bought this phone about 10 days ago and I am very happy with it.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135272492,It's first function should be a phone,2016-11-19T20:16:25.000+00:00,2,"Does a lot of things, but none well.  Too many limitations on file saving and other functions to sell band width.  Marketing overwhelms customer satisfaction."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135182800,Sound quality is great!,2016-11-19T13:51:11.000+00:00,5,"This phone has the best sound quality of any I've owned. Although there is no message indicator light, I love the fact I can just wave my hand over the screen to check for notifications."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,135178618,Accessories,2016-11-19T11:33:27.000+00:00,3,Like the phone but accessories are not easy to find.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,135059447,VERY user friendly,2016-11-17T21:32:34.000+00:00,5,"I bought this phone last week and I am loving it. The phone is very flexible and easy to model to your preferences, and the Moto gear function is just phenomenal. The Moto camera takes some of the best pictures I've ever had. For the first time I was also able to change the Google maps guidance voice to Australian accent. No other phone I've had let me do that, and I change phones once a year."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134960652,Rating moto z,2016-11-17T02:27:08.000+00:00,1,"I've had this phone barely a week and have been tempted to return it. I hate the poo looking emojis, plus they never stay attached to my texts after I hit send, if i add them while writing. The keyboard doesn't have the punctuation in the same screen as the letters, so to punctuate I have to move from one screen to another. Then a bit ago I tried editing the writing in a text and the delete kept hoping to the end of the text rather than the first word where I kept putting the curser. There quite a few strange quirks like that, these are the reason for the low rating. Really???? The emojis look like a pile of Dodo!!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134956632,too many new areas I still need tolearn,2016-11-17T00:50:04.000+00:00,5,"great phone, too short, too bad"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134933361,Excellent quality.,2016-11-16T18:48:01.000+00:00,5,Great quality and features. I'd definitely by another Moto in the future.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134885537,Nice!!!!!,2016-11-16T07:40:45.000+00:00,5,Nice!!! Phone graphics are amazing
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134832021,was easy to learn (with Practice),2016-11-15T20:40:34.000+00:00,5,Up graded from flip-phone. WOW
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134654557,I'm not in love. . .,2016-11-14T14:31:21.000+00:00,3,"I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone I've had for more than 2 years. I was afraid to get another Samsung since the rumors right now are that they're blowing up... So the sales guy recommended the Moto Z Droid. I had seen the commercials and don't plan on using any of the attachments, ever.  
I really miss having the notification light... I REALLY hate that there isn't a home button and the fingerprint scanner is the only ""button"" on the screen of the phone (so it's a major waste if you don't use the fingerprint). And you can't just use the fingerprint, you have to use that AND a password or pin or pattern... I don't like that I can't create folders in the apps storage to more easily hide the ones I don't frequently use. Lastly, and I'm not sure this is the phone or the user (the sales guy) but the way my contacts transferred over is ridiculous. I have 9 of the same person and three of this other person, it saved only this person's work phone number. I only had 67 contacts to transfer but that number more than tripled with a lot of the same contacts...  That has really ticked me off.  
On the plus side the phone is very fast, the screen is bigger, it was easy to purchase accessories online, I like how quickly it charges, I like how long it can stay alive, the quick functions like flicking the phone a certain way turns on the camera or flashlight are very convenient. The camera is better than my old phone and there is a flash for the front camera too. Overall any new phone was going to be an upgrade from my 2+ year old phone..."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134644111,"So far awesome phone, great pics and great service",2016-11-14T13:08:15.000+00:00,5,I bought it 2 weeks ago and was a little iffy about it because we are not droid fans period but this droid just brought us back. Love everything about it so far
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134625190,very similar to my old phone. made it easy for an old man. like the change in off/on button.,2016-11-14T00:54:52.000+00:00,5,very easy to use and get use to

That's a big plus, the bad news the battery life leaves much to be desired. Alittle bit smaller than my Nexus 6 but that's okay, but my battery life was still better. All and all great phone though nice geek tricks, you'll still like it!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134459385,Whaat,2016-11-12T20:31:22.000+00:00,1,I won't buy this poor excuse for a cell phone. Another chunk of green for a projector and another chunk of green for a snapon battery ect.... Does this thing come with a holster to carry all this junk? What a terribly poor design.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134458960,Wrong stop vibrating,2016-11-12T20:25:35.000+00:00,3,The agent suggested this but I am not sold on it.  Only keeping it because of restock fee.  If you dont mind vibrating when touching buttons or a smaller screen this is a great phone.

I'm still learning how to work everything. The size and weight were the main reason for the MOTO being my new phone. So far I'm liking this phone!!!!!!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,134073532,Easy features and space,2016-11-08T21:39:49.000+00:00,5,I really like the phone's capabilities and attachments that goes with it

It has some nice features like voice commands - I'm sure I'll learn something new about it each day/week."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133840953,Easy transition.  Nice features.,2016-11-06T19:20:25.000+00:00,4,"I purchased the phone a week ago.  One issue that I have so far is that the volume level is.much lower than my Motorola Droid RAZR M.  Also, I use my phone as a mobile credit card reader.  There is no port to plug in a card reader."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133757279,Awesome Phone,2016-11-06T04:23:04.000+00:00,5,"Had my Moto Z Droid a bit over a month, Completely satisfied!! All the Moto Mods are also an added luxury. I recommend this phone to everyone, it is so much easier to use than an Iphone, with most of the same options."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133724058,"Transition was a snap, and the features are beyond cool.... like flicking the wrist to reverse the camera, as well as a front facing flash",2016-11-05T18:52:57.000+00:00,5,"It's only been two weeks, but I'm hooked."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133517583,Moto Z zooms,2016-11-03T23:44:47.000+00:00,5,Bought Moto Z`s with battery mod for my wife and myself. Performance and battery lif are absolutely wonderful.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133442151,Battery power weak,2016-11-03T01:29:27.000+00:00,4,The battery drains fast.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133343891,Good phone,2016-11-02T14:20:38.000+00:00,3,"This phone overall it nice, biggest disappointment is the battery life. Before buying I read reviews overall great reviews about phone. So both my husband and myself bought this phone. He is a truck driver so he need his phone to last he got the force. The biggest, well only complaint is battery lofe. Seems like the phone battery last most the day as long as you don't use the phone at all. Maybe we were spoiled by our Samsung notes, but I typically have to charge Moto at least 2 times to make it though the day, sometimes more. I do use my phone but no more than I used my Samsung which I usually only charge at night and was fine for the day. I lower the brightness and turn off location, no Bluetooth and still dies quickly. I also make sure there is no apps running in the back round.  Positive is charger does charge fast but if you are not in a area you can plug your out of luck. The phone is thin and has options to add speaker, projector, camera and ext battery all sold separately and are pricey. Other then the battery I do like this phone, it has a good camera and lost of options."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133319546,"Great Phone, once you get used to it.",2016-11-02T03:46:00.000+00:00,3,I just bought it last week and I am still adjusting. I used to be able to control sounds and notifications for each app by going to settings. This is driving me crazy trying to figure it out. I don't like the constant notifications from Facebook and emails but need to know when someone is texting me. Turning the volume down is not an option.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,133192399,Nice size. Nice features.,2016-11-01T18:52:25.000+00:00,5,Proven brand and reliability.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,132861811,Not good,2016-10-30T22:00:55.000+00:00,1,I bought this phone a little over a week ago. The salesperson said it was a great phone. Well it is not. I was told the battery was very good. Well it is not. I cannot make it to lunch without recharging. The charger is different so I can't use my old chargers from my other android phones. Now I have to bring my charger with me everywhere.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,132847687,Amazing phone!,2016-10-30T19:16:02.000+00:00,5,I've had my new Moto for 3 weeks and I'm in love! I've had Samsung phones for 5 years and had no idea how much better Moto had made the Android experience!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,132842416,Amazing Features and so fast!,2016-10-30T18:58:18.000+00:00,4,"I have had Samsung phones since the S2.  I went to the S3, S4, then to Note 3, Note 4 and Note 5.  I have loved every single one of them.  I wanted the Note 7, but you know that story.  I was looking at the G S7 Edge when my friend told me about the Moto Z.  He went with me to look at it and I decided I had to give this phone a try.  He has Mods you can get with it so I got the extended battery/wireless charger; the projector and the add on camera that has a telescoping lense.  They all are very cool and work really well.  I can't recommend this phone enough."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,132477777,Hate this phone,2016-10-27T23:53:16.000+00:00,1,Had to give up my Samsung bc it was a fire hazard this phone is terrible touch screen is horrible mic talk to txt never wants to work battery is useless and never pulls any wifi

Motorola Moto Z Droid,131706406,Excellent phone with great reception!,2016-10-22T02:39:23.000+00:00,5,"This is an excellent phone and is a very easy transition from the iPhone I had previously. Go into the Verizon store and play with all of the phones there. Only a few stand out, and that includes this Moto Z. This phone is extremely well built and it just works. The battery life and signal reception are excellent. If you live in an area without a great signal like I do, then you need this phone. The reception is much better than the iPhone. The phone is not loaded with a ton of extra software and it all works flawlessly. I checked out the newest iPhone and it just feels like a toy compared to this phone. I would recommend the Moto Z to anyone looking for a great, affordable smartphone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131529677,Great Phone,2016-10-19T19:22:03.000+00:00,5,"I bought this phone for my wife.  It took her a few days to get used to it, but, now she absolutely loves it!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131526813,Dissappointed,2016-10-19T18:35:55.000+00:00,3,"This phone does not have good battery life.  I find some apps are glitchy.  The speaker on phone calls is tinny sounding.  The finger print feature is good.  The response time is very good, but as I mentioned can be glitchy at times.  My worst complaint is the battery life.  I do not like that you can not use a cover to protect the whole phone if you use the back cover. I haven't used any Moto Mods."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131451002,Still learning the features!!,2016-10-18T19:21:59.000+00:00,5,"I bought this less than a month ago, but ❤❤❤❤ it so far!!!!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131403820,Good Phone but buggy...,2016-10-18T12:11:44.000+00:00,3,"I am not loyal to Android or Apple phones, but having said that I came from an iPhone 6s. I purchased this through my local Verizon store so I was able to have a hands on experience. The manager of the store had the projection moto mod and I thought that was a very cool feature. I was looking to go back to the Android OS again and Samsung didn't appeal to me at the moment (thank goodness after the NOTE battery fires!). Having this phone since it's release I can say I have a love/hate relationship with it. The internal battery is terrible so I had to purchase the battery mod, without the external battery this phone would be useless. It doesn't make the phone much thicker though, but I find it a necessity! The camera is nice when you have full light to take pictures in, BUT low light pictures are some of the worse I have seen on a phone as of late. My older 6s blew this camera out of the water. Some apps I use work most of the time, but I find this phone to be buggy. I don't know why some apps work and some do not, but it can be a pain in the rear. There are times someone will send me a text message and the phone never notifies me. This happens with FULL cellular signal and 4GLTE! I have reset the phone, turned it off and back on and nothing fixes that problem. The volume is also terrible and when turned up to it's max, is still to low to hear, especially in a busy environment. The fingerprint scanner is a very nice feature that I use for almost everything! The screen resolution is also nice and I have no complaints there. I would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants a stable phone. I  think I got hooked on the moto mods (to which I only have the battery mod pack) and didn't get as OCD which I normally do. I don't think I will have this phone very long."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131389991,Marvel of Engineering,2016-10-18T01:07:30.000+00:00,5,This phone is wafer thin and does it all. Screen is bright and big. Fingerprint scanner is excellent. Battery lasts all day. Best phone I ever had.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,131355001,Great phone,2016-10-17T18:30:37.000+00:00,4,Switched back to Android from Windows because of the disappearing apps. I chose this phone because I didn't want an iPhone wannabe . I love the motion features like turning on the flashlight and camera. Camera could be better but I guess most cameras won't compare to my old Lumia icon's features and lenses. But so far feels solid and smooth.

A new issue popped up today, I couldn't get a mobile deposit accepted by my credit union. Still trying. Don't know if it's the photos which don't look very clear to me or what yet. Also the battery isn't any longer lasting than the one I just turned in. Another issue which is overrideable is it doesn't recognize Google, only Google Chrome."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130587846,Decent phone although has some bugs,2016-10-14T17:59:39.000+00:00,2,"I've only had the phone a week... In that week, there have been 2 ota updates that have ultimately ruined the speaker performance on the phone. The notifications are so quiet that you can't hear them unless you're in a really quiet place."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130523506,Great Phone,2016-10-14T13:18:17.000+00:00,5,"I had the Samsung Note7 in my hands the first day it came out and something just told me to wait a few weeks because I expected defects. The Verizon man also told me to wait and maybe consider a previous Note like the 4 which still had a removable battery. We both had no idea that a defect this serious would have happen with Samsung phones. With that said I went back to motorola because prior to my S3 I had a droidx.  I've had this phone for 3 weeks now. It's everything I need. It's fully functional, super fast and I was instantly sold on Moto mod capable. My only issue is the home screen button is part of screen and while texting I often hit it instead of the space bar. Other than that, the speaker could be louder but it's loud enough to wake me up in the morning and be heard downstairs while ringing. Overall it's a great Phone , don't be afraid to leave Apple and Samsung for it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130504664,"Not happy.  Unit is slippery, won't support a holster, and screen easily activated",2016-10-14T01:08:09.000+00:00,1,"I had a Moto Droid Turbo and liked the phone with the textured holster and kick stand.  This Z won't fit a holster due to the extra Tumi battery pack is too thick.  The phone is so slippery, I constantly almost drop it.  On top of that, the screen is right to the edge so your fingers, while gripping just the sides, trigger screen actions.  

I am really unhappy with this phone.  It is a work tool, not a fashion statement to me."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130416383,New phone is nice,2016-10-12T22:21:59.000+00:00,4,bought the Moto Z Droid a month ago ... I am getting use to the Android OS needs better and easier hands free talking. ... I like the mods that you can add to the phone .. the speaker blew away my friends and the image is sharp
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130405326,Not what i expected,2016-10-12T19:02:40.000+00:00,2,I bought this phone last week when i was on vacation. I get on the plane to come home only to find out that the phone does not have any phone jacks. I was upset and had to fly all the way back to texas with no music. Then i tried to charge my phone only to find out that the phone did not have the regular charging port. so my phone died. if youre looking for the add on gadgets for the phone they are very expensive..other than that it is a good phone with alot of power.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130339926,It's a droid!!,2016-10-11T21:45:31.000+00:00,5,My phone broke so I had to upgrade. Hate to spend so much money on a phone. Phones are ridiculously expensive. Phone working great so far!!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130329946,Great phone,2016-10-11T18:51:43.000+00:00,5,"I originally planned to upgrade to another phone, but the Verizon wireless associate showed me the Droid Motto and I was sold. I like the slim profile, and the lightness. Since it's an Android phone, it was easy for me to use, since my old phone was also an Android."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130264254,Great phone!,2016-10-11T00:55:10.000+00:00,4,I bought the phone about a week ago and it's awesome!
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130261213,Easy Transition,2016-10-10T23:53:00.000+00:00,5,"I have always been a droid guy and I just upgraded from a Droid Maxx to the Moto Z. I really liked my Droid Maxx and so far, I have only had it about 2 weeks, but I really like the Moto Z. The big kicker though now, which kinda stinks $ wise but technology has changed to make charging better, is with the newer Droids is you will be buying all new acessories (so add another $60-$90 to your upfront costs), especially chargers, as they charge your phone extremely faster (which I love), but they use a different connector now. But I love the phone so far, the battery does drain quicker than my Maxx did, but I can still get a good 24hrs on a charge with light data use and maybe turning the Battery Saver on so it's not too bad. Plus you can charge your phone in about 15min. now compared to my old Maxx which could take 4-5 hours to completely charge."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130246410,Mediocre phone with ridiculous lack of ports and USB cables. Wish I never bought it.,2016-10-10T20:30:22.000+00:00,2,"I got this phone because I broke my 2+ year old Droid Turbo, and couldn't get a replacement.  Here's my pro/con list:
PRO:
-light and thin
-Good display
-like the fingerprint lock
-Like the magnet back innovation and potential accessories

CONS:
-Only ok audio (I like my phone to be a good PHONE first and foremost
-no earbud jack
-mediocre battery life
-less good camera than the Turbo for lighting and correct color (without color adjustment options, either!!)
-""new"" charger plug means I need to buy all new chargers
-NONE OF THE CHARGERS HAVE USB ENDS -meaning you have to buy ANOTHER cable beyond the factory charger it comes with in order to synch with your computer.
-apps menu is now scroll instead of left/right swipe, meaning you have to look down to get an app (like Maps or Waze) instead of swipe swipe tap, because you know where your apps are.  Lazy design work.
-Less intuitive layout/usage.  Trying to upload ringtones (thanks to poor layout and also lack of USB charging cable) took far too long.  I wound up downloading new ones from a website.

In short, it's trying to be an Apple phone instead of the next fabulous iteration of a Droid.  Droid, we love you  because you AREN'T Apple.  Stick with what you know, and get rid of the four steps to do things where there used to be only one step."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130170960,love this phone,2016-10-10T04:58:21.000+00:00,5,One thing I think that Verizon and Google play could do is if you wanted to get an app but wanted to see what its like instead of having to download the whole app make it so you can download a trial of the app and if they want to keep playing they can download the app off the Google play store but that's just my opinion
Motorola Moto Z Droid,130168802,New Motorola droid phone,2016-10-10T03:00:28.000+00:00,1,"I can't connect to my car blue tooth  with my phone for receiving phone calls . The only way someone I can hear anyone is if I put my phone on speaker, which is dangerous when driving"

Everyone tells me that they can hardly hear me. I go in and out and sound like I'm in a tunnel. What can I do about this?"

Motorola Moto Z Droid,129891394,"Great features.  Easy transition,",2016-10-07T13:34:30.000+00:00,4,Battery that comes with the phone leases a little to be desired.  It seems to improve a little with use and keeping the apps turn off.  Changing the location of the on/off and volume buttons on the side takes some getting use to.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129865017,Nice Phone,2016-10-06T22:17:21.000+00:00,4,"Basically the same as the LG G3 I traded for it, it looks better, is faster, but user customizations won't work for ringtones if you create your own edits. Home charger is hardwired, so no pulling the USB3 wire for optional connection or PC interface.
This phone feels like Motorola is just dusting itself but still needs direction. Get a clue"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129803767,Amazing phone,2016-10-05T22:23:36.000+00:00,5,Awesome phone. But the speaker is a little weak

I planned to return before cracking my screen because I didn't like the camera. My pictures were very grainy.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129747812,"Hello, Moto",2016-10-05T04:04:27.000+00:00,5,"I'm two months into my Moto Z, and as a life long Motorola owner, always on big red, I can say that this is the best and most innovative phone I've ever had. It's fast. Really fast. Like scary fast. Upgradable memory, beautiful all day battery and stunningly thin and fast camera. The Moto suite of actions just makes this thing all the sweeter. Oh did I mention it's modular? Any time you want a battery, bigger speaker, or screen it's a click away. Best idea ever."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129694537,Moto Z Droid,2016-10-04T18:53:57.000+00:00,5,"Love this phone, switched from a Droid Turbo. My favorite phone so far!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129535357,Moto Z is a solid device,2016-10-02T23:25:46.000+00:00,4,"Switched from the Droid Mini to this phone. Took some getting used to just due to size difference, but I like this one now. Definitely has some cooler features built in (e.g. Flashlight) as opposed to having to download apps for it. Really hard to find cases for it other than ordering online, and no cases exist that will allow you to have any of the mods attached to the phone, which is a HUGE fail on the part of every company making cases for this phone. I haven't had a chance to test out all the features (like moto gestures) and have yet to spend any money on the moto mods as they can be pricey (the projector is half the price of the phone), but overall it's a good phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129524522,Great battery life and easy to use,2016-10-02T19:24:33.000+00:00,5,I got this phone about a month ago and it is easy to use great camera and fantastic battery life

Motorola Moto Z Droid,129418220,Best Smartphone Yet!  Outstanding reception and flexibility.,2016-09-30T18:15:58.000+00:00,5,"My Moto Z is, by far, the best I've gotten.  Last year I upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S4 to the iPhone 6 and discovered that I preferred the setup of the Samsung.  So, I reverted to the S4 and was reminded of the poor reception from an apparently inferior antenna system in the Samsung...absolutely no service in my building at work where I had somewhat better reception with the iPhone.  Well, I walked my new Moto into the building yesterday and maintained a 4G and 3G signal.  I'm very happy!  I like the slightly larger size and functions that, to me, are superior to the iPhone.  I've had every type of cell phone since 1991 (brick, flip phone, blackberry, earlier Motorola, Razor, you name it) and I've discovered the best yet in the Moto Z!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129296560,Phone is unbelievable,2016-09-29T18:57:06.000+00:00,5,"Love quick charge.  Very user friendly and functional.  I'm hooked on Moto Z.  I'm a senior and fairly tech savvy, but this phone is so easy to set up and use would recommend it for anyone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,129264418,Very superficial,2016-09-29T14:59:16.000+00:00,1,"This phone is very basic for what you're paying. I switched from my Droid Turbo to this phone (only because my Turbo shattered) and I returned it after a week or so. The operating system is the Marshmallow, which is not anything to get excited about. The camera is sub-par, the battery doesn't last for 8 hours, and the phone was very glitchy. I was not impressed at all, especially with the design of the phone. It's very thin, so thin the phone doesn't come with an aux output. Instead, you have to use this adaptor cable for headphones, which was very annoying. Maybe I'm the only person who is constantly listening to music on my phone, but I was very annoyed with this missing feature. The Mods feature doesn't work the way you'd think. The backs come off the phone rather easily, even the basic cover that comes with the phone."

Motorola Moto Z Droid,128669675,Exactly the experience that I wanted,2016-09-23T18:33:15.000+00:00,5,"I've had the device for just over a week now and I'm very happy with it! The phone looks great and is very easy to hold (it is quite a tall phone but narrow and that makes it work well for one-hand use). The fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast and accurate - I've never seen any phone work as well as the Moto Z Droid. Many reviewers seem to be surprised that the phone doesn't have a 35mm headphone jack which presumably means that they didn't look at the phone before buying it. It does come with a usb-c to 35mm adapter but, because I primarily use bluetooth headphones, I haven't taken it out of the box yet. I think removing such an archaic analog port is the right thing to do but, for audiophiles using traditional headphones, this may well be a bigger deal for you than it is for me. 

I had two concerns when I bought the phone - the camera and battery life. The camera  has produced some great photos with three elements I'm interested in - focus, detail and vibrancy. I would agree that it isn't quite as intuitive to use as some other flagships  (particularly in low light) but, given a little time to figure out all of the options in the camera, my concern is laid to rest. For battery life, the question was whether the phone could make it through the day without relying on the battery moto mod as a default. The answer for me is yes, provided it is a typical day (e.g. downloading and installing the latest security updates does not qualify as typical). The Mod provides peace of mind though and means that I don't have to change my usage because, if in doubt the mod is there and it replenishes the battery very quickly. 

Although much of the media attention for this device has been about the mods or about the lack of the headphone jack, where the phone really shines is in terms of software. If you've used a Moto X in the past, you already know that the software creates an experience that, in my view, is unmatched. The always on display (just wave your hand over the phone), chop chop for the flashlight, double twist for the camera, texts read to you when you are driving, custom launch phrase, screen that stays on when it knows you are reading, etc. All of this over an otherwise vanilla Android that just flies, without a stutter or lag. 

The Moto mods are a great concept, with really smart engineering to make them work so seamlessly. Personally, I don't think you should buy the phone just for the mods - they are icing on the cake for an amazing phone. 

I'm very happy with the Moto Z Droid and would happily recommend it to others. This is the Droid I was looking for."

I love the phone and all of the great functionality, but it is just too large for my taste. I am going to keep the phone because it suits my needs very well, and there just aren't very many small phones out there. The slim design helps with the size a little bit. I'm a guy and I would normally keep the phone in my front pants pocket. Seriously, I think this phone would be just perfect if the screen was about two-thirds the size.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,127728665,Wow! Great phone. Will definitely keep this one around for 2+ years.,2016-09-12T19:56:41.000+00:00,5,"I've had a good bit of time to test this out now.  I use a tech21 case and have not played around with the mods yet. The phone is awesome and people are blown away by the video and photo quality. Even tho it is not as good as the force in megapixels it still excels as a daily shooter for me. I have dropped it face down on pavement twice without a scratch, perhaps thanks to the tech21 and the screen protector. For me the shatterproof would have been a nice addition but I prefer the slimness of this phone. It is ideal. It is so easy to use with one hand or two and has many accessibility options. On my old phone (turbo) my hand would press the screen when I tried to reach all the way to the top corners. This one I can use and it does not detect any false presses! The battery is adequate but makes me feel a bit like an iPhone user being more tethered to the wall. I love everything about it, ignore the haters because they have unrealistic expectations. Phone is a beast and is pure quality."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127724243,Love the Moto z,2016-09-12T19:13:20.000+00:00,5,"Great phone!!!!
It is very fast and easy to use"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127671066,Horrible phone,2016-09-12T01:33:23.000+00:00,1,"I have had this phone 1 month and it has locked up and I have had to pull the SIM card to reset it.  Now it is overheating, not powering up and buzzing if sim card is in.  They better give me a new phone tomorrow when I go to Verizon store!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127397501,"Awesome phone, now I want some magnetic pods for it",2016-09-10T10:06:56.000+00:00,5,I want a power pack pod for it and the one that turns the camera phone into one with a zoom lens.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127381528,Hard to hold,2016-09-09T22:26:07.000+00:00,2,"The phone functions just fine, but it's so thin and the surfaces are so slick I always feel like I'm about to drop the phone. If I'd spent more time holding it in my hand I probably would not have bought this phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127352685,Cool features but buggy,2016-09-09T17:21:31.000+00:00,3,I replaced my previous droid moto with the moto Z. The phone is nice overall. I like the fingerprint pad and it works well. It's much easier than entering in a PIN. I like the USB-C plug (even though I had to replace all my charge cords). Also the thinness of the phone comes at a price: Battery life with the internal battery is not good. But my biggest complaint is that this phone is buggy; several of my apps  that worked perfectly with the previous moto routinely crash on the moto Z.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127254237,Very good voice-call sound quality; battery life needs to be managed carefully,2016-09-08T14:57:23.000+00:00,4,"I'm old-fashioned enough that I use my phone for calling, and this phone is a huge step up from the Droid Turbo it replaced in terms of call quality, so a big plus for that.  On the flip side, the Turbo battery life spoiled me and this phone is not nearly as long-lived - a trade-off from the slim size I suppose.  Manage your apps and your screen options carefully and you'll be fine.  App installation and translation was smooth except for Gallery - I had to download a 3rd party app because Google Photos just doesn't work as well as my old Gallery did, and I don't like all my photos automatically going to the Cloud."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127134969,Complicated,2016-09-07T15:55:05.000+00:00,4,"This is my first smart phone. I've had a flip phone for years. So, it is frustrating to use for now...getting help from various sources. Love the photo quality."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,127100087,Read this if you have a battery problem,2016-09-06T23:51:15.000+00:00,5,"Purchased Aug. 17th.  Within 2 weeks of buying the phone I dropped it and shattered the screen.  The new replacement was easy and fast but I noticed quite a difference in the batteries of the 2  Moto Z's.    My 1st phone seemed to lose battery power Very quickly with normal use and usually I found I had to charge it by mid afternoon.  It also took a long time to charge and I was honestly getting somewhat annoyed.   The phone I have now is wonderful and the battery is great.  No need to charge it as often and the charging time is so much faster. ( All the settings were identical for each phone.)   I honestly think that anyone who is having battery issues needs to go get it checked and hopefully you can return it for a replacement.  It seems like some of the batteries are faulty. 
The Moto Z is a fantastic phone and I am so glad I bought it!!!
I hope they correct the battery problem.  
The only other request I would like is that they make All cell phones shatter proof. We certainly pay enough!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126948821,Great features,2016-09-05T22:44:30.000+00:00,3,A little different from previous Motorola but learning something new everyday.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126882351,Good phone lots of fun features.,2016-09-05T12:27:12.000+00:00,5,"I bought this phone one week ago.  So far so good.  Lots of fun features.  The moto mods are cool and easy to use, I have the JBL speaker/battery.  Battery life is OK but my old Droid MAXX held a charge longer."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126828851,Way too big,2016-09-04T15:21:03.000+00:00,1,"This was the smallest phone that verizon offers, with the exception of the iphone, and it is still way too big.  Since i don't like apple, the iphone wasn't an option for me.  I miss my android mini.  This phone is big enough that it is actually difficult to hold onto.  I'm over 6' tall, so it's not like I am a petite person with small hands either."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126474750,Great phone but,2016-08-31T23:54:41.000+00:00,4,Great phone but has some hiccups playing videos
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126421267,I love this phone,2016-08-31T03:54:59.000+00:00,5,"I love this phone and the Moto mods. I wish it had custom themes and a headphone jack. Other than that, I absolutely love it. I love the always listening device. I love the software on the phone. It's so quick. The fingerprint scanner is one of the best I have used on any phone. The Moto speaker dock is so awesome. It makes listening to music a pleasure."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126366599,Fastest setup an easy to use. The projector is awesome,2016-08-30T19:25:35.000+00:00,5,I bought this phone a week ago an already want to get another for my wife
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126176930,I really like the features.,2016-08-29T19:31:11.000+00:00,4,Reminds me of my galaxy
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126172673,"Great features, battery life isn't great",2016-08-29T18:55:09.000+00:00,3,"I thought I might have a hard time transitioning to the larger size of the Moto Z, coming from a Droid Turbo, but I am very happy with the bigger screen. The thinness of the phone is also great. I am, however, very disappointed in the batter life of the phone. Fully charged in the morning, I find myself having to recharge by noon every day."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,126114150,love my phone,2016-08-29T13:24:09.000+00:00,4,easy to use and looks great with the thin design.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125950670,Good phone,2016-08-28T20:36:31.000+00:00,4,Had phone a few weeks so far so good.  Bit I didn't realize that there was no spot for ear buds. I only realized it when I went to plug in ear bugs the other day.  So I t would be nice to have.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125949975,Powerful but buggy,2016-08-28T20:35:05.000+00:00,3,"Purchased the Moto Z Droid to upgrade a Droid Turbo. In the weeks I have owned it, I have found it to be fast and user friendly. Problems I have discovered are network drops and GPS loss in areas I have never had problems before. It is nice to have the SD Card back."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125630368,Best Motorola I have ever owned,2016-08-26T21:43:17.000+00:00,5,"Don't let the small battery size fool you.  This phone is super frugal on standby time.  With normal in and out, checking email, minor use for navigation, some internet searches, and a few apps, this phone can easily last all day.  Processor is very fast, does not seem like you wait for anything but downloads.  This thing is so ridiculously thin, I have been calling the plain back that comes with it my ""training back"" since every time I take it off the phone feels too thin compared to my Droid Turbo, so I put it back on.  Eventually I will probably take the plain back off permanently. Built-in speaker is decent.  The improvements to Moto are very nice.  Hands free in the car is improved because the commands got simpler. It seems like the phone interprets the commands much more accurately also. I did not buy this phone because of the fingerprint reader, I was never one to lock my phone anyway because of the nuisance of unlocking it every time I wanted to look at it.  However, this fingerprint reader is so simple to set up and use, I am now using it every day. It is no more difficult than pressing a home button and works every time.  I set it for my index finger on my right hand and my thumb on the left, and it works every time. I have had other family members try to open it with the reader, and it always stays locked.  Charge time is insanely short.  It usually takes less than an hour to come up from 35-40% to full charge. And unlike my Droid Turbo, the turbo charge on the car actually works on turbo."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125628641,Don't be fooled,2016-08-26T21:41:02.000+00:00,5,"Don't be fooled by the battery size. This phone is optimized and the battery lasts.
Super fast phone smooth as silk didn't want a plastic screen so I chose this over the force. I am very happy with this purchase."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125522599,I'm all about music,2016-08-25T18:50:47.000+00:00,4,"I only had it a week. Can't wait to get the speaker mod for it. Only issue there is no headphone jack in the phone. I have to use a additional piece for my headphone and aux cord in my car. So now I gotta make sure I don't lose it.  I like that you can add speakers, but you can't have a headphone jack?"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125522276,I love the format and style of the phone,2016-08-25T18:47:01.000+00:00,4,"I purchased the Moto Z Force a week or so ago and I'm satisfied overall. One thing that did throw me off guard was that there was no Aux cord hole. I'm a big fan of the Aux cord. As my vehicle does not have Bluetooth I'm always reaching for the cord. It is great that I am still able to listen to my own music with the alternative cord for my phone, but it seemed like that was the only thing that was missing."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125482512,Moto z,2016-08-25T02:30:15.000+00:00,5,Only had it for week now never liked moto before but this phone is awesome for even a 54 yr old like me haven't been this pleased with a cell phone in couple of years tried I phone Samsung HTC Asus several brands but this tops them all no hype just facts love this phone once it catches on it will give iPhone and Samsung run for their money I give it a 10
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125457237,Great phone. Moto Mods are awesome too!,2016-08-24T19:44:50.000+00:00,5,Very fast phone. Screen is great and the battery life is fantastic. Just picked up the battery Moto Mod and it is really easy to use and adds wireless charging too. Happy so far.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125418225,"Fast, light weight great features.",2016-08-24T03:09:53.000+00:00,5,"Verizon needs to make their long time customers feel appreciated, without trying to change their plans & increasing charges where other carries are not."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125321273,Fun and easy to use,2016-08-23T12:42:09.000+00:00,4,Easy to use and get familiar with.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125307334,Not impressed,2016-08-23T01:28:32.000+00:00,2,"Should have stayed with Samsung.  I don't like that you have to have an adapter to have headphones plugged in, and I don't always use wireless headphones, so keeping up with an adapter is inconvenient."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125284227,Not that happy.,2016-08-22T20:06:46.000+00:00,2,"The battery life is terrible.  Motorola's fix:  basically, don't use the phone.  For lack of a better term, I was ""shamed"" by a motorola rep for my phone having a screen time of 5 1/2 hours in one day.  Honestly, I would certainly not consider that heavy use of a smart phone.  As a professional, most of us use our phones hours a day for emails and work productivity, I am no different.  The battery life should last at least 12 hours of moderate use. This does not.

Furthermore, the other ""fix"" was to turn off either data or wifi every time, every time!, I'm not using my phone.  How is that in line with how a typical smart phone user uses and depends on their phone?  It's not!  My Samsung S4 Active, at 3 1/2 years old, had a better battery life.  This phone is also heavy, and the location of the volume controls are awkward, especially for people with smaller hands, like myself.  

I have taken to deleting or disabling every app I do not need or is not necessary for running this phone.  That means there are quite a few apps I use in my day to day life as a professional I have yet to install in fear of further battery draw.  I certainly did not think a new phone would limit my ability to be productive, and I fear this one will.

Additionally, this phone is poor in quality in terms of durability and construction.  I had it three days and the screen cracked.  For the record, it was not dropped, stepped on, sat on, or mishandled in any way.  My S4 Active, that thing was dropped down concrete steps, basement steps, swiped off countertops onto ceramic floors, etc., not a crack to be found.  I'm extremely disappointed in this phones durability and quality construction.  

As for the technology of the phone, it's okay. The picture quality is sufficient for my use of this product.    

For this being a product Motorola put out to compete with Samsung and Apple, I believe it fails miserably.  I should have stuck with Samsung and gone for the S7."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125282682,Tough,2016-08-22T19:52:58.000+00:00,5,Already drop it 10 times still works fine
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125246017,Great phone.,2016-08-22T16:44:15.000+00:00,4,this phone has everything you need. Very thin and very powerful.  I don't like that they changed from micro-usb to usb-c.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125223149,So Far it is Good not Great,2016-08-22T14:27:15.000+00:00,4,"Bought this a week ago and the design is pretty neat.  The camera is good, the battery lasts what you would typically imagine, but it fully charges in an hour which is great.  A few downfalls is that the sound when you are talking and have it on speaker is quite soft.  Also there is no headphone jack, which seems quite odd."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125163233,Easy to use. Battery life is not very good at all,2016-08-21T20:50:37.000+00:00,4,Fair phone compared to my old one
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125139235,"Ok, but nothing special",2016-08-21T18:33:02.000+00:00,3,"Nothing about this phone makes me go ,""wow"". It works. It is extremely slippery. You have to buy a case or risk easily dropping it.  Without the extra attachable speaker, it's really quiet. I was super bummed that I can't set the alarm with my music anymore. Also bummed it doesn't have some of the features on my old phone. Stepped backwards I guess. Oh well."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125124924,Such a fantastic phone!,2016-08-21T15:43:01.000+00:00,5,I got the Droid Moto Z Force a few weeks ago. And I am in love. It's not to bulky and it's fast. And the mods are incredible. Especially the JBL speaker.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125094710,Great features,2016-08-21T02:48:54.000+00:00,4,Bought this phone 1 week ago. So far so good. Just came from an iphone 5c. I was ready to go to an Android.Only complaint is that I can no longer text with only one hand as the screen is too big and I can't reach the far side of the keyboard. Also the phone does not come with a cord that has a USB end. So I had to special order one so I can connect it to my laptop.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,125083338,Best moto device to date,2016-08-21T00:23:53.000+00:00,5,"By far the best droid phone out there , extremely fast"

I love the finger print reader."

Whether unlocking via the fingerprint reader or playing games, this thing is fast! I really appreciate that I can have a svelte phone when I want, or a bulky tank if I expect to be away from my charger for an extended period. The Moto Mods concept is a wonderful take on modularity. I have the Incipio wireless battery Moto Mod and the JBL speaker Moto Mod. Both function flawlessly with the phone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,124630351,"I like the new phone except, I need to buy expensive portable charger, or expensive battery pack cover.

Battery life lasts no where near what we were told.  Usually down to 50 % or less by end of day with conservative usage.  Husband has the same phone with the same issue. Internal speaker quality when we talk does not appear to be as good as the Moto X; phone cuts in and out at times when we speak.  Limited options for protective cases.  A little larger for my personal preference, but is extremely thin which is nice.  Nice mod options to be able to attach."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,124552039,Good flagship Droid,2016-08-15T21:04:53.000+00:00,5,I really like the fingerprint reader and stock Android. The fingerprint reader doubles as a lock screen switch. I personally wouldn't want it to double as a home button nor would I want the fingerprint reader to be on the back of the device. I get a full day out of a single charge and I do appreciate the fast charging. My device is usually fully charged in less than 30 min. The lack of a headphone adapter is not a deal breaker. My previous phone has problems with dust in the 3.5 mm jack and had to be cleaned frequently. Perhaps the USB-C interface will work better. The phone is super fast and the display is excellent.

Motorola Moto Z Droid,124190833,Love this Phone!,2016-08-12T15:55:04.000+00:00,5,"This phone is smarter than me - which may make me jealous at times.  I love how the intuitive pop-ups have guided me through the process of setting up my preferences, etc."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,124154417,Great phone,2016-08-12T02:43:13.000+00:00,5,"Very fast great response and good battery life. I have the speaker mod and it is awesome, it has great sound and has 5 hours of it's own battery life so it doesn't drain the phone. Would love to get the projector mod but for now it cost more than I am willing to pay."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,124133480,"Nice phone, but have a lot to learn.",2016-08-11T20:22:04.000+00:00,4,Just need to know where are my contacts.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123901334,Easy transition,2016-08-10T18:56:14.000+00:00,5,Upgrade less than a week
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123898228,Moto mods and top of the line specs. Need I say more?,2016-08-10T18:34:14.000+00:00,5,Bought this pretty much on release day and love it. Everything is snappy. Quick. Camera is a decent quality. The Moto mods are fantastic in my opinion and leave this phone will plenty of potential. Love it.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123898012,"Trade in,",2016-08-10T18:30:36.000+00:00,4,Glad I did..I would recommend it..
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123861540,Great. A couple issues to improve,2016-08-10T02:15:53.000+00:00,5,"This phone is great! I always use Motorola since cell phones began. This one changes one item I don't understand why the change. It combines phone ring volume and notification volume. Can workaround, but most people want a loud ring, quiet notification.  Also removal of mods to use a case seems a drawback especially for the battery mod. Those are the only things I can see that anyone could improve on. I would absolutely recommend this phone!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123861442,Just got phone 1week ago and it's just great,2016-08-10T02:14:08.000+00:00,5,Just got it a week ago and it is great
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123834191,Awesome slim phone,2016-08-09T21:04:26.000+00:00,5,Very easy to use fast charging. And amazing pictures
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123816129,Stellar SmartPhone,2016-08-09T19:19:44.000+00:00,5,"After a week with the Moto Z, I am super impressed. It was very easy to configure and personalize. Data transfer was a breeze and both WiFi and Cell connection are rock solid and strong. The phone is fast and the mods work great. I have the JBL Soundbooster and the Incipio battery mod. The battery mod gives me 2 days before charging and adds little weight. Droid is back with a scorching hot smartphone."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123743925,"Good Features, OK Battery Life",2016-08-08T21:50:36.000+00:00,4,"I have had this phone for over a week now and overall I am happy with it.  Pictures are  great with super high resolution.  Only complaint so far is battery life, and if I use the phone frequently, I may need to recharge during the day."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123742447,New Moto Z,2016-08-08T21:30:06.000+00:00,4,The most difficult part is that this phone did not come with any set up booklet and I am having a devil of a time trying to figure things out. Additionally it won't sync with my Fitbit nor my Bluetooth speakers . I think I have paid a lot for a phone I am unsureof .
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123612334,Wish I could rate zero,2016-08-08T04:22:03.000+00:00,1,"This phone was just released a couple days ago and I waited for my upgrade to be able to get it.  I bought the accessories and within one day my phone broke.  The screen is more sensitive than the iPhone.  It says it's got Gorilla Glass but that's a joke, really light drop shattered everything.  I loved my turbo and it was durable.  Would not recommend this to any one."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123598077,"WONDERFUL, easy phone to use!",2016-08-08T00:04:11.000+00:00,5,Love my new phone! Very easy to use!

Motorola Moto Z Droid,123583096,"Motorola moto z droid, very easy transistions from previous phone",2016-08-07T21:55:00.000+00:00,5,So glad I finally decided it was time for new phone.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123565057,Love samsung galaxy my s7 is amazing had three loved them all,2016-08-07T19:54:38.000+00:00,5,I am happy I stuck with Samsung I have had the s3 s5 now the s7 loved them all
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123521001,New and innovative,2016-08-07T02:22:55.000+00:00,4,"A little awkward without a back at first, but very nice with the snap on back and the mods attached. Excellent battery life and with the battery pack it lasts 2 full days. Camera quality is nice, but with the ois it can be tricky when moving too much. Besides that, wonderful!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123513615,Love the looks and ease,2016-08-07T00:09:19.000+00:00,4,"Its been two weeks and I""m slowly learning but love everything about it and easier to read emails and phone numbers."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123470229,Horrible have to exchange it already horrible device horrible,2016-08-06T19:26:12.000+00:00,1,I would like someone to call me because this is been a horrible experience my device is not working properly what so ever and I have 2 already exchanged it for another device with having it with about five days of use this is not right my proximity sensor does not work whatsoever
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123463977,Moto Z quick review,2016-08-06T18:20:23.000+00:00,5,"I bought this phone 1 week ago, 90% sure I would take it back... Why? Because ive been using Iphones since the VERY first one a decade ago.  I tried android about 3 years ago and immediately returned the phone and stuck with Iphone.  I dont know if its this phone, or how far android has come but I am a convert.  The power of the phone is amazing. Everything opens in an instant, its quick to open apps, browse youtube, etc.  Everything is fast.  I love the option to review texts, etc with the press of my finger, rather than opening the phone.  
As for the moto z.  Its a GORGEOUS phone.  Quaity steel construction and beautiful glass front.  My only complaint would be the HUGE camera bump. However the phone is too thin , yes i said ""too thin"" so I use the included back plate at all times anyway, completely negating the camera bump.
Battery life is ""meh""   but I dont want the heavier Moto z force, so Ill buy the moto mod tumi battery pack and snap that on when I need more juice.
All in all, im an android user now, and happy to be so."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123463876,Easy transition.  Love many of features,2016-08-06T18:19:04.000+00:00,5,I bought this phone a few weeks ago and have had no problems and enjoy very much.  My only issue is that my previous Motorola/Droid chargers do not work with this phone. The Moto Z had different input so that is kinda a bummer
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123429352,"Despite the price, the mods make the phone",2016-08-06T03:54:10.000+00:00,5,"This is a huge upgrade from my previous phone (2014 Moto X), but it's really the mods that make this amazing.  The cost of each mod is prohibitive, but they function so much better than their standalone equivalents.  The way they integrate into a seamless whole becomes something greater than the sum of its parts!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123381630,And I buy yet another Moto phone...,2016-08-05T22:00:11.000+00:00,4,"I preordered the Moto Z and received it on July 28th.  Here are my impressions thus far:

Battery Life:  I consistently end the day with 25% remaining, and that’s using it primarily to text and browses the Internet via Wi-Fi. Very little 4G use at this point, so be warned. The only plus is the turbo-charging mode that puts me at 75% in 15 minutes.

Fingerprint sensor:  It works great, and it's all I use to wake and sleep the device. 

Display: Bright and very readable, great for games and videos.

Camera:  Works well, but does not deliver consistent shots in the same light. Being an amateur photographer I have always taken multiple shots so I usually get at least one good one anyway.

Controls:  The placement of the volume controls is frustrating to get used to.  They moved the power button under the volume controls.

Size: With the Incipio Dual Pro case (which incidentally I don’t like) the phone is even wider but still thin, I have large hands so it's not a problem; my wife however would never want one due to the shear size. For those considering buying the Moto Z, the available cases will only fit on the device when there are no Moto Mods attached. As an FYI, the aforementioned case is a pain to remove and yet another reason it will be replaced when Otterbox releases theirs.

Why I chose the Moto Z:  As a software developer I prefer the minimalist Moto UI approach (unlike the Samsung Touch Wiz and others)."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123376494,Moto Z,2016-08-05T21:31:42.000+00:00,4,"Beautiful but: 
Don't  like no ear phone jack on top!! Being a girl I have lots of diff dust plugs for bling. 
Tiny speaker at top. 
Kinda heavy to be so slim. 
Also no shells for girls!! She's naked. Bought Kate's shell but too thick. Was surprised since shell that came in box is great but ugly color for girls (grey). So bummed."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123355027,Amazing!!,2016-08-05T19:00:50.000+00:00,4,"I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago, and so far I love it! It is so fast and responsive. The finger print reader is instant and accurate. The rear camera takes amazing quality pictures. The ability to add mods to it is awesome. (Just wish there was more mod options) The only thing I dislike about the phone is, as a developer and power user, having a phone with an unlockable bootloader is a HUGE drawback. I have actually considered returning it and getting a different phone just for that reason. However, I love the phone so much, I can't bring myself to return it."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123354699,The best Droid ever!,2016-08-05T18:54:57.000+00:00,5,Super user friendly. The Mod Power Pack attachment was the best invention.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123354041,WHAT LIES BENEATH,2016-08-05T18:43:42.000+00:00,5,Actuality just receive my phone last Friday. Was up til 2am Saturday morning w/phone. There are great features and modular for this phone even turning phone into a movie projector and to use camera you just turn twist YOUR wrist back snd forth  w/ phone in that hand. My MOTO Z DROID WOW ME!!! You really have to experience the connection Of
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123349330,Great phone,2016-08-05T18:29:53.000+00:00,5,Love everything about it.  Best Android phone I have owned.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123228528,Fantastic Phone,2016-08-04T18:51:34.000+00:00,5,"This is a great phone. Very slim, very well built. Comparable to iPhone 6s Plus in build quality. Great screen. Manageable battery life (considering the size of the battery and the size of the phone. Would recommend. Moto Mods would fantastically (attesting to included backp late, JBL speaker, and Tumi charger) ."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123228469,Moto Z,2016-08-04T18:50:23.000+00:00,5,"Although i have had this for a week.. I love it
Like my last Droid, it is very easy to use and it has a nice big screen.
Very user friendly"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123182711,Good but not as good as I hoped,2016-08-03T23:50:46.000+00:00,4,"I've been using now for a few days.  The volume is not loud enough and when I make or answer a call, there is a long pause before I'm connected.  It does not have as good features as the LG and the camera does not have good share options."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123122205,Great phone. Weak battery,2016-08-03T18:40:38.000+00:00,3,I love the phone and all the options and Mods. But battery is weak and doesn't last more than half a day and I do not use the phone much. Have you charge it twice a day. My Droid turbo was better.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123122099,Great device,2016-08-03T18:39:55.000+00:00,4,I got the Moto z about a week ago now I love the device but hate how much trouble I am having finding a charger aside from the FAR OVER PRICED ones at the Verizon store I can't seem to find one locally so it's order one online or wait.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,123065013,Best phone on the market,2016-08-03T02:47:56.000+00:00,5,"It cannot be left understated just how premium and beautiful this phone is.

I have used Motorola products since the first ever Razr. I had every keyboarded Droid, and all 3 Moto X devices. This lives up to the legacy of those devices and then some. 

Best performance and smoothest animations I have seen on any smartphone to date. The Moto Z is incredibly thin, so even when you have mods attached, it's no thicker than most other phones on the market!

The battery lasts surprising long, despite being so (comparatively) small on the regular Z.

The mods have been very useful so far as well. The JBL mod is loud and clear, and has its own battery so it doesn't drain the phone. The power packs are probably the most ""useful"" so far...It keeps the phone juiced up all day, to where it's still sitting around 80% after more than 14 hours. That's with fairly heavy usage, too. And the Kate Spade power pack is utterly gorgeous, too."
Motorola Moto Z Droid,122708846,Screen shattered first day I had it. 55 years old first screen to shatter brand new 4650 device meant for everyday use with built in antiquity.,2016-08-01T13:23:06.000+00:00,1,Received the phone friday activated it saturday screen shattered sunday.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,122611515,If you live in a poor signal area.....,2016-07-31T21:03:20.000+00:00,5,"Then this is the review for you. I upgraded from the Samsung S6 edge and I'm very happy I did. The droid force seems to have a little bit stronger antenna as indicated by the signal bar and hangs onto the 4g signal longer. Moto version of Android is a lot smoother and has less bloat than Samsung's Android but Samsung has more customization options on the home screen. 

Battery life on the Moto is good enough to last all day and the turbo charging system is good enough to give you about a 20 percent boost or more in 15 minutes. If there is a Moto mod attached and the phone is plugged in it will charge the phone and mod at the same time. Camera quality is great and very quick to launch

Moto mods work very well. The phone comes with a dark wood looking back cover and is held on with magnets. If you get a case the back cover has to be removed in order to fit. I got the JBL speakers with the phone and they work great. Just pull the back cover off and pop the selected mod on. The only thing I don't like is some of the mods are quite expensive"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,122529181,Awesome device!,2016-07-31T09:26:43.000+00:00,5,"I swap devices often, so I have been through many many phones, and I can safely say that even though I have owned this phone only a few days, it has risen to one of my all time favorites! The build quality of this device is on point! Its feel in the hand is just as nice as it's looks. And when they say this phone is thin, THEY MEAN IT! Even though it is crazy slim, I do not feel like this is a device I would easily crush or bend. 

Not only is this device beautiful, it's software is near perfect too. Lenovo/Motorola did a great job of not adding in senseless apps that Google had already created with Android. I don't need to worry about choosing between Motorola's calendar app and Google's calendar app, because there is only one! Same with the calculator, and the web browser and so on. It's a fresh, clean Android device with no heavy skins on the software like some other manufacturers.

And finally, the innovation of this device is so nice! It's ""modular"" system is fantastic. It really shows how adaptable and flexible an Android device can be. I am sorry to see so few Moto Mods out so far, but I can tell you that the ones that are out work GREAT! And with Motorola's Modular Development Kit, I cannot wait to see what other people can come up with!!!!!!"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,122181532,Great phone,2016-07-29T13:31:33.000+00:00,5,"I traded up from a LG G3 (horrible phone btw) and I have been so pleased with my new phone. The Mods work seamlessly and hot swapping batteries is a thing of the past. It does come with one back panel ( I can't wait to get more) and I got the JBL speaker and the Incipio battery pack. 

The phone itself is blazing fast and when I speed tested it against a S7 it actually preformed better, just by a hair though. The battery is a little small, but the extra battery pack makes up for that. The Speakers are crazy loud for how small they are and this phone is incredibly thin.

My only issue with the phone is that if you put a case on your phone you cannot use the mods without taking your case off. Going to see how that plays out for me, but I have never broken a phone yet (cross my fingers and toes I didn't curse myself there LOL)"
Motorola Moto Z Droid,121876888,speakers r bad,2016-07-29T00:31:23.000+00:00,1,I just got the phone and i'm ready to take back. The
Motorola Moto Z Droid,121422021,Excellent.,2016-07-28T19:46:48.000+00:00,5,This seems to be a excellent device. I traded my s7 edge for it. While I will miss Samsung pay using the mods is a plus for me. I got the battery mod myself and I must admit it is very well done. Much better then the G5. The device is lag free. Has expandable storage. Feels great and very well built. Very happy so far with this device.
Motorola Moto Z Droid,120813994,Great phone!,2016-07-25T09:09:06.000+00:00,4,"To of the line Android. My favorite phone or right now. The price is a little high. The mods are cool, excited for the future."
