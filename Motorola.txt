Hot swap moto mods are fantastic need more choices Size and function options of the Moto Z are great The first year everything runs smoothly fast great battery lifethen it changes Battery life drains away to the point where I must leave it on charge most of the time The phone randomly gets very hot Bluetooth connection drops Cannot find wifi routers though there are multiple available ones that the phone had connected to before Then theres the perpetual rebooting I actually had to reset the phone back to factory twice Now is slow and battery life is minimal The camera was great to start with now it drags to open and focus by then the great shot you shook your phone for has gone Oh and no upgrade to Pie available I wish the execution lived up to the concept Very disappointedmy phone suddenly turns off with the battery charged when I want to turn it on it is 3 charged It is impossible to believe that I connect it to the charger and 80 on the screen okay I unplug it and do not spend even 20 minutes and it turns off again
This is a martyrdom for me I feel cheated by you my motoz play phone started to suddenly turn off when the battery was charged I can not work because I make a call and it turns off I open an application and it turns off and it only stays on having it connected to the charger This product is defective
I followed step by step all the solutions and I can not find a way to make this I tried all the tips and there is no solution there is no solution
You want to give life to a phone with an operating system that has two years of life  in that way then we should buy a new phone
Is that what it is about
Ive had motorola for almost 20 years Ive grown up with each model and I feel like I will not buy another motorola because Im very disappointedThe internet is full of customers that own these phones and when the updates happen the battery will not stay charged The interesting thing is I didnt have any problems with any of the updates until after the phone was paid off
I believe this is a ploy to force people to upgrade I will never buy a Moto or anything produced by Levono againI have had mine 8 months  Love the phone but now i cant use my phone unless it is plugged in  The battery mod wont keep it charged eitherPurchased Moto Z 2 years ago at full price After 1 12 years the phone started with battery issues It would shut down when I tried to take a picture when the battery was 80 When the phone would power back on it would show a low battery of around 10 At first I thought it was a camera issue But battery went downhill from there A few weeks later the battery was so bad that I needed to keep it connected to a portable power bank at all times Now I have to tote around this phone with a power bank connected to it The second I unplug the phone from the power bank phone shuts off Same when I connect phone to turbo charger the second I unplug the phone from charger it shuts off This is unacceptable and I will never buy or recommend a Moto phone againI bought this phone less than 2 years ago I now have problems with its battery It would shut down erratically Sometimes it would shut down when the battery is at 35 or the other times when it is 20 I took it for repair three times they changed the battery but now it doesnt charge I would not recommend this phone to anyoneI bought this phone last year and after a year using it i have notice that the battery drained fast I have to charge my phone all the time for me to be able to use it otherwise its unusable at all I did factory reset on this phone but still same thing  Battery sucksSo far Ive loved my Moto Z even though Ive had a few problems but the battery issue is NO LONGER tolerable The phone has to be charged 3 or 4 times a day and its driving me crazy It will completely cut off with 35 battery remaining Some times it says its charging but when I look at the battery details under settings it says not charging which requires an unplug and replug The charger isnt the problem as I have 3 different chargers and the same thing happens with all of them These are genuine Motorola chargers not aftermarket junk There are no mods on my phone Not a terrible number of aps All pictures are backed up and cleared off frequently Cache is cleared regularly 

Original phone purchased Nov 2016
RIP Phone 1 Dec 2016 brand new  Bluetooth was broken couldnt be repaired 
               Was issued a refurbished phone as a replacement even though I was 
                 still paying for brand new device
RIP Phone 2  March 2017   Phone started smoking when I plugged it in to charge 
RIP Phone 3  March 2018  Phone started randomly rebooting 
Phone 4  My current phone and the battery has been an issue for about 3 months nowBattery died with less than a year I was lucky they sent a new oneMy six year old phone works better than this phone  My eleven year old phone works better than this phone  There were no problems until that one update and yall cant be bothered to fix it  WasteI use this phone for business so it is more than just an inconvenience when the battery dies with no warning  It will tell me I have 64 but then I go to open a window or take a picture and it just turns off  Plug it in says it has 35 so turn it back on and it dies again  Would love to have Motorola contact me about thisAs with many others I had thoroughly enjoyed this phone with the moto mods and the long battery life and turbo charging but then after about a year of use I had the same issue as has been reported wouldnt hold a charge consistently  Its especially a problem because with the investment in motomods I had expected to use this phone for longer than a normal phoneI have had my phone for a year or two now It was a great phone but now even at 80 it will randomly shut off When I try to turn it back on itll just shut off again or show its at 0 and not turn on until I put it on the charger Mine got stuck in an infinite loop of trying to turn on get to the blue screen with the red M then shut off and try again I did a factory reset on it and it didnt help the situation at all I wont be buying another Motorola product after this fiascoBattery dies after a few months Even after the battery is replaced with the OEM part it died after 2 weeks againbattery does not work at all has to be plugged all the time volume buttons do not work after 8 monthsBattery drains rapidly from 100 to 6070 then goes to 0 in seconds since software update  Motorola aware of the issue but not addressing

Positively ridiculousOnce you download Android 80 on this phone you will only be able to use it while plugged into the wall The battery life goes from 100 to 0 before I can even switch from home charger to car charger I just bought it last Xmas now I have to get a new oneFirst Year work perfect Camera Battery Life After a Year issues started I did system update battery life dead when a have 50 battery and take a picture phone shout down and battery drain from 50 to 3 first when I bought thought Moto z was 
 one of the best phone for my but now I dont spend none on motorola products any moreIts a great phone  battery lastest forever But I would the screen to be bigger Wife and I both bought Moto Z Droid phones 2 years ago to replace our Samsung S4s  We liked the unique features of this phone and it was easy to use

However about 1 year into our 2 year contract my wifes phones battery degraded and the phone started acting strange  Acting strange meaning the phone would report the battery percentage as falling rapidly the phone would spontaneously reboot and the battery percentage would gap down after reboot for eg from 50 percent to 2 percent  Then the phone would just die
She got a replacement phone under the protection plan but the replacement phones bluetooth didnt work hence a 2nd replacement phone  which worked

I use my phone less than her now after 2 years its starting to have the gap down battery issue my wifes previous phone had so its basically on its way to dying

Longevity is certainly not a strong point of this phonePhone was great for about 11 months Battery drain is out of control and came out of nowhere Phone will completely shut off within an hour of being 100 This phone is still being sold for an extremely high price when Motorola should replace all of our phones On top of that their other z phones are sold out So goodbye Moto been using yalls phones since the flip phone days Never againAt first this phone was a very nice purchase and seemed worth every penny  However after 2 years Ive had 3 different Moto Z droids and it has all been because eventually the battery would fail to take a charge or the USB C charging port would start to fail to recognize the fast chargingMissing IR blaster for remote control devices no Photo Gallery app only Google Photos and several bugs Smart Lock is not working and you cannot disable the gradual volume option Until I upgraded to Oreo there wasnt a File Manager eitherI have always loved Motorola Products and have become brand loyal for years March 2017 I got the new Moto Z There was a system update end of AprilBeginning of May 2018 and after that my phone would freeze randomly shut off get extremely hot and be at 90100 batter life then shut off and not turn back on saying the batter was dead I went in to Verizon and it was replaced

Last week another system update came through and here we are again SAME EXACT ISSUES This second phone is not even 6 months old Now I have to take the time to go to the store and do all over again 

This phone is a lemon I am extremely disappointed in Motorola and Lenovo as I have become fans of both 

Do not buy this phone All the good things it does isnt worth the hassle of it crashing I have a small child and travel a lot for work I depend on my phone greatly Unfortunately I cannot rely on this one at all

NOTE Both times I had done Factory Resets as suggested and it does NOTHING If you look in multiple chat groups this happens to hundreds of people and they are all told to do the Factory Restore as the solution and it NEVER worksI used Moto G 1st gen for five years and as an upgrade I bought this phone in January 2018 First five months were amazing Then the camera quality reduced gradually After that now the phone restarts randomly for no good reason It has been some time since upgrading to oreo no new applications were installed One morning it just started rebooting I calibrated the battery as instructed in forums performed hard reset wipe etc NO CHANGE This phone is not reliable and Motorola needs to do somethingMy phone is not even 2 years old  I can only get 3hrs on battery saver mode of use from a full charge Thats using the factory charger  letting the phone charge to 100 Sometimes the phone decided to power down at 4050 battery life then when you plug it power it back on it says its at 3 battery life I called Motorola support  they said that this is not a know issue that it sounds like my phone is getting old thats why the battery is not working as well as a brand new one I added a battery app on my phone yesterday to see exactly how many times I have to charge the phone on different chargers just to make it through the day  a two day total has been 78 times Thats pretty said considering Im a moderate phone user who works 10 he shifts once I get to work I rely on my office phone  computer because my cell is so unreliable and may dye at any given momentAccubattery on my Moto Z says it has 32 of remaining usable capacity from when it was new of 3000mAh 

It is not an error It is a total of about 75 perhaps 100 full recharge cycles amount of watthours into the battery

The battery is heavily degraded I take a video and stop the video every few minutes and see it 10 less And the phone can have power cut to it if below 50 or so if taking a video or something taxing 

I have only used this for about 9 months before it was in a box partially charged 

I do leave it plugged in most of the time Phone manufactures should put in a mode to only charge up to 80 which yes I know the Moto mod efficiency mode will do Relatiely inexpensive for the 2220mAh one so I ordered that to let my phone limp along Ill see how well that works with the degraded battery But it should just be an option without the mod just as many laptops can now and most electric cars

Same battery degradation has happened with my Moto G4 twice I had it replaced once under warranty after about 9 months Replacement was degrading too but then i upgraded 

Its proof I think that the battery cell chemistry used is junk Along with all the other bad reviews and posts AWill the Z2 have the same issues Well see 

Another issue is the glass or plastic cover for the camera the lens it broke soon after I started using it while in my pocket 
Also it thermally throttles the SOC if the battery gets about 40C in order to keep the battery from getting too warm Results in very slow performance in the summer timeI was surprised by the low rating  I have had this phone for over a year  I originally intended to update my phone every year but I see no point in changing it right now as the Moto Z unlocked still appears to have the highest specs and it still works flawlesslyGreat phone esthetically one of the nicest out there and very robust However it pretty much stopped functioning a month after the warranty ended so a little more than year after purchase It just switches off randomly a dozen times a day even with a full charge and takes 510 tries to switch on again The same thing happened with my previous Moto phone so I guess it is actually a feature of the brandAfter using Motorola Moto Z for about a year Im totally disappointed about this product Battery life is so pure it dies in a couple of hours When the battery is below 40 it might suddenly shut down and when turning back on its on 1 worst battery life I have ever seen 

For the finish Ive accidentally broke the screen and I cant replace it here in Georgia as everyone in a digital service centers say that this product was a total fail and theyre not getting any replacements for this modelHad this phone for 15 years and love this phonewill buy one for wifeI have owned this phone for a little over a year and a half at this point Initially this phone worked great and functioned in every way that you would expect a smartphone to do I had the battery and speaker mod and both work great After about a year of owning the phone began to frequently lock up with the most recent image frozen on the screen Id have to reset the phone for it to function Other times it would get extremely hot and the battery would drain very quickly More recently it has become nearly unusable It will frequently shut down at random battery percentages 50 75 85 even 95 to 100 Recently it has even been turning off despite being plugged into the wall charger and saying that it has 100 charge Often if a text or phone call comes in the phone will just turn off as soon as it starts ringing I can no longer rely on this device as a phone or even for browsing the internet while its plugged into wall power  Researching on the internet this seems to be a somewhat common problem with no apparent solution Do not buy this phone if you hope for it to reliably function for more than 1 yearI have been using this phone for 6 months now There are no major glitches However at times the cell phones used to freeze during initial days when I had made a couple of updates Now with no updates it works smooth Battery life is good if you can turn the location off Battery dies off early than other phones as its only 2300 mAh with 57 inchesIve had mine for over a year now and it still works very well most of the time My main concern is the battery life It is absolutely horrible And that was  one of the big selling points that made me decide to buy the phone If wasnt for the 3800 MAH Moto mod battery Id be in very bad shape And the stock speaker started getting fuzzy in less than 3 months And now the turbo charger barely works either Since the last update the fingerprint sensor has become an absolutely worthless button Unless Im missing something But worst of all Ive come to realize that Motorola does not hold its resale 
value like Samsung or iPhone Even though they cost pretty close to the same brand newIve had alot of internal problems with this phone my on and off button doesnt work and my volume button do not work Ive only had for a year I have to trade in because I dont like it anymore Thank youI have had no issues and the phone has been though a lot of punishment It is a great phoneMy battery on my Moto Z Droid at 100 will drop incredibly fast In 5 minutes it will drop to 80 without use Battery life is minimum under 20 minutes The phone shuts off at around 60 and will not turn on unless plugged in When charging it states random percentages My phone when manually shut off will not turn back on and taking pictures also shuts the phone off My battery does not last through a night I must plug it in I have tried different restarts and do not have any large apps or apps running in the background My phone is unreliable These phones are also expensive and problems occurred after warranty I tried customer service and they did not know what the problem was many other motorola phone users have the same problem like meThe phone did exactly what I wanted to and I daresay I was even happy for a whileThat all changed once the battery began to fail The phone was treated well and looking at online forums its easy to see that I am not an isolated case The Moto Z droid is plagued with battery issues What do I mean by battery issues Its just depressing My phone can now barely survive 23 hours of use before it dies from full charge If you ever restart your phone and are lucky to have it actually work it comes back stating you have 15 battery left I cant play games take picsvideo below 65 battery because my phone will just shut off 

This phone is truly garbage Naturally these issues happened the month after the 12 month warranty expiredjunk 3rd one in less then a year sending back again under manufacturer warranty You have been forewarnedOn multiple occasions while using this phone it would turn completely off due to the battery running out when the bar says it is at 30that should not happen on any phonethis is my 5th moto it is clearly a defective devise i want a note i will pay the difference but swapping this phone 5 times for defects is a pain please helpBattery life is TERRIBLE Camera quality is subpar at best Didnt realize there was no phone jack on this model never thought I would have to check for that on a phoneI honestly loved this phone It was fast thin and had plenty of storage of me For the first year I had this phone I would have argued with anyone the the Moto Z was the best phone on the market  Then literally two days after my year warranty was up I did a system update and my battery started draining in 3 hours  I had to put my phone on airplane mode if I wanted it to last more than 6 hours So since I couldnt afford to fork out another couple hundred on a phone I bought a Motorola battery mod  This boosted my battery life quite a bit  However once the mod battery is dead my phone shortly follows Once my phone is using its own battery it completely shuts down around 30  Once it is plugged in it still states the battery is at 30  My phone shuts off on a daily basis  Im extremely bummed that this phone has been such a disappointmentHave been with Verizon since September of 2017 and we have had so many problems definitely has been a bad decision on our end My phone is terribly slow never can get my problems resolved And its not just one phone its 3 phones on my planIf you like charging your phone at least twice a day and having to reconnect your bluetooth then this is the phone for you
Plus side is when you do charge it which is often it does charge quickly  

Ive had this phone a little over a year It was awesome for the first few months then suddenly it went downhill after about 6 months I now have to carry around a portable battery charger so my phone doesnt die while Im running errands My phone used to connect automatically when I got in the car then it randomly didnt connect I renamed my phone and reconnected and that worked for a few weeks then I had to repeat the process 

Im really sad about this because the phone really was nice but I just cant handle this batterybluetooth issueLet me start out by saying Im very familiar with cellphones and reasonably technologically competent This phone took a slight learning curve to get used to The settings are very different from another Android based phone Ive used Settings are nearly impossible to change Simple stuff like changing the quiet mode times and Bluetooth connections Ive had the phone for about a year now and will never buy a Motorola product again

pros It does have a pretty decent camera and I like the quick chargerI loved this phone when I first got it As soon as I had it a year of course no longer under warranty it started having issues Sometimes the speaker does not work so when someone calls I cant hear them and they cant hear me Lucky for me restarting it seems to help But the most annoying part the battery I pick my phones for their battery life so the fact that it is now an issue sucks It does not fully charge have tried other chargers so that is not the problem If I am lucky It will charge up to 85 But it will turn off because the battery is to low as soon as it hits 55 I pretty much have to have it plugged in all the time If I dont even when I am not using it I am lucky if it stays on for 2 hours 
I just hate this phone and I wish there was something I could do but you also can not replace the battery in this phone So Im pretty much stuck with a phone that has to but plugged in all the time for another year
By the way I am very careful with my phones it hasnt been dropped and has no damagebattery is horrible not sure what type of airplane grade aluminum is used and the glass is fragile have seen many that are not holding up well at all I even remember seeing claims on how strong the glass was and touting no worries if it breaks just let us knownot seeing these claims anymore  I have been a loyal Motoral user and unfortunatley have invested too much in the Mods if I did not would have switched to Apple most likely probably still will just pay the price litreally too bad MotorolaHad to purchase the moto mod battery for all day use  September 2017 update from Verizon caused the hotspot and Bluetooth to stop working  Verizon sent me another one but now I have a phone that randomly reboots for no reason which is a real problem when using gps maps for travelPROS Shortcut Flashlight Feature Shortcut Camera Feature Fingerprint unlock feature 2 SplitScreen feature that works only for certain apps Turbo Charging Feature Attractive slim phone

CONS Probably the worst phone battery life Ive had in my 10 years with Verizon The pop out camera lens gets scratched very easy Therefore it ruins the camera quality permanently unless you replace it just to get it scratched again No AUX port Uses USB Type C charging port Therefore you would have to convert all your micro USB chargers to USB type C plus you would preferably offset the AUX port with something Bluetooth but now you have 2 different chargers to take care of Overly sensitive built in Mic I cant record any live concerts because the playback would sound like blown speakersI had the moto for 4 months Nothing to complain about reallygood call receptionnice screennot so great battery lifehad to get the battery mod to make it threw the day Ended up trading it in for the note 8 which in a different league altogatherthe moto is worth your time if a good deal is foundI already reviewed this phone a week ago and apparently it got taken down so I will make this one shorter   This phone is GARBAGE  It runs slower than John Candy  It seems like something is running in the background causing it to be almost useless however there is nothing running   If my phone is anywhere below 45 charged and I try to take a picture using flash it turns off  drains the entire battery  I hit the power button and it shows about 4   Plug it in  sometimes it will instantly show 25 and turn back onother times it will even show 100   Even brand new this phones battery life was atrocious  Ive had it since last Christmas and it has been nothing but trouble   The camera when it doesnt render my phone useless is nice  Thats about the only good thing I can say  I wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone   Actually Id try and call my friends and tell them never to buy this phone but im sure my phone would turn off before they have a chance to answerThe function of this phone is slow and sloppy  The only people that seem to like it are Motorola fans  It does not have gorilla glass  We have four phones and two have been dropped landing flat on the screen and the out screens are broke  Every time the put out an update the configuration has changed  The software on the phone is not just about completely different from when we first purchased these phone  The battery does not last half the life they tell you it does  With the last update they finally fixed the turbo charging feature that didnt work for about a year  If you have small hand this is a two hand phone  The mods that they offer are nothing special  They are all hype and no show  Save your money and get a real phone thats not a Motorola  This company has simple gone down hillI attempted to upgrade from a two year old droid turbo that I thought was slow due to its age This phone was no faster than my old one and in some cases I think it may have been slower  This was the only Motorola phone the store had so I took it I live on a farm 30 miles from town so my service isnt the greatest but my old phone would last 18 hours and then some being in my poor coverage area The moto z lasted four hours and was looking for a charge and I made one eight minute phone call and three texts in that time  I returned the phone after seven days and had my old phone turned back onThis was about our 10th Motorola telephone This new Droid is the worst decision I have made in purchasing a phone The camera lens sticks out such that it scratches and cracks within a few months and it is your responsibility to pay to fix it In addition the connector for charging stopped working after a few months on both of our phones  We  have to use a wireless charger and a large battery pack on the back of the phone to recharge  Motorola customer service which we had never called in the prior 10 years of having Motorola phones is abysmalI was due for my upgrade so I went to Verizon and wanted the Samsung galaxy edge 7 I was told they didnt have any in stock so the pushed the Moto Z on me I told them I needed at least 64 GBthey said the Moto only comes in 32GB but you can buy an SD card for more memory I bought the SD card but the only thing I can transfer onto it is pictures  videosI cant transfer apps to it so many times i have to delete an app before I can download a new one
The phone has a HORRIBLE problem with shutting itself off Many times i have been at 2735 battery life and it will shut itself off Other times i will be at full battery life and it will continually shut off and on for 20 minutes before I have to do a hard resetMy prior phone was a Moto X 2nd gen The Moto Z Play is a step up in every way This is a mid range phone with great performance Where it excells is in battery life I dont have to carry a charger or a battery pack to work any more I can get two full days out of the battery  I really like Motorola and there approach  to smartphonesI buy sell and trade devices I have had iPhones Samsung Galaxy devices HTC LG Sony and many Motorola devices I keep coming back to Motorola because they simply offer the best overall package and performance available

The Moto Z Droid is an outstanding device Excellent build quality top of the line specs for 2016 with the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB RAM along with expandable storage and a recent upgrade to Android Nougat 711

Performance is smooth without so much as a hiccup Motorola has the vanilla Android with Moto flavor perfected Yes you have the Verizon bloat but these can be disabled if not removed Any application or game you throw at this will fly Period

Camera performance has improved with the 711 update Not as big of an improvement as afforded the Z Play huge improvement but this 13mp shooter didnt need a huge upgrade It performs quite well for most anyone who isnt a photographer Pictures on the Z have a clear and neutral color quality not oversaturated It records 4k video at 30 fps but more importantly for me it shoots 1080p at 60 fps There is a noticeable difference in any device between 30 and 60 fps You will appreciate this if you take a lot of video

My biggest pet peeve with smartphones is their poor battery life Admittedly I was concerned about the 2600 mAh battery in the Z Dont be It isnt the battery champ the Play is my Play is currently at 23 hours battery time at 51 percent  with 4 hours and 33 minutes onscreen time running 711 However it performs quite well in its own right and gets me an average of 4 hours plus onscreen time Standby time is also outstanding Battery drain is minimal when left not chargingand screen off 

Why get the Z over its midrange brother the Z Play Well I have both so here is what I like about the Z Its thinner much thinner at only 52 mm thick and just feels so premium in the hand I put a carbon fiber skin on this using a style shell from Incipio on the back and it looks and feels fantastic in the hand I also have a leather Moto style shell that feels great Also if you add the battery packs available the phone doesnt feel huge I use these on longer trips and they easily get me over a day and no fatigue from the extra width or weight 

The Z adds the quad HD display versus the 1080p on the Play Both look excellent However side by side you will appreciate the difference between them The Z also uses Gorilla Glass 4 for superior clarity The Force for example has Shattershield but it wont look quite as good as this I have a Skinomi polycarbonate screen protector on it and it feels perfect Its also well protected 

Call quality is fantastic as is the norm from Motorola devices Reception is excellent and WiFi Calling is perfect for rural areas with spotty reception and an available WiFi connection Neither Samsung nor Apple come close in call clarity to these Moto Z devices I have an iPhone 6s as a work device and have owned many Samsungs They simply dont compare if you still use your phone to talk

The elephant in the room for this device and the Z Force is the lack of a headphone jack If you use Bluetooth headphones it wont matter If you use wired cans you will need to use the USBC dongle To me it isnt that big of a deal Sound quality is average an area I wish Lenovo would improve upon The HTC devices have 32 bit DAC converters which make audio through headphones sound fantastic The LG V10 and V20 also offer high end audio 

Moto isnt the sexy choice compared to Samsung and the iPhone but it is to me a better choice Simple to use lightning fast solid battery life more than acceptable camera and video a superior fingerprint sensor gorgeous 55 inch AMOLED display Gorilla Glass 4 flagship specs and superior call quality make the Z an outstanding choiceOverall excellent mobile Would purchase upgraded version over again Camera quality is incredible Graphics likewise Sleek design and comes with magnet backcoveronly thing i love about this phone is the extended battery life with the moto mod Ive had this phone for 8 months and now it freezes up for no reason and is now extremely slow I always have the battery pack mod on for the extended life obviously but for some reason that I cannot imagine there is not a case made to fit the phone with the mod attached A case for the power pack should be made its logicalI have had this phone since December   1The upgrades mess it up every time  2 the charger doesnt work to charge it   I have to use my car charger  3 the battery has to be changed a couple t times a day  4  People call and it wont let me answer them sometimes   Just this weekend I have had to turn it off and on 3 or 4 times  This usually helps receiving calls 5  It drops calls daily  6 There are dead spots on the screen   7 this has been the worst phone I have ever had and I have had cell phones for 20 years  I cant wait for my agreement time to be up so I can get something else   And I can assure you it will never be a Moto againGood phone average battery get force droid for better battery life Fast charging but have to charge twice per day with usageIve had this phone for 6 months now  The battery life is the worst of any phone Ive had  I have to charge the phone a couple times a day to avoid a dead battery  Ive gone back to Verizon and let them know of this issue and their advice is to purchase the battery mod  Very disappointed and completely dissatisfied with this phoneI have had my phone for three months and it doesnt hold up to the same standards Motorola once had My phone freezes all the time and I have to wait for it to reset itself This is a weekly issueThis is the worst phone Ive ever owned Im on my 4th replacement since Nov 2016 The idea of having one speaker is a terrible design And Motorola is no help to me at trying to  resolving  this issueThis phone is very heavy and difficult to text from  The extra battery pack is necessary and its a nice feature  This is my 4th smartphone but I find myself coming up with reasons not to use itI was a Samsung user until the Note 7 problem I decided to switch to Verizon from Sprint to get better service Verizon service is great Good android phone but doesnt even compare to Samsung My favorite parts of this phone is durable screen and battery life worst is the camera Cant wait to move back to another phone just not sure which direction I want to go Never liked the iPhone have one for work and dont like the curved screen on the Samsung Waiting to go to the new Note 8 Pixel 2 or if Verizon gets it the Nokia 9After using this phone for several months I am still thrilled with it  The call quality is amazing excellent speaker phone the camera is everything that I need the quick charge is so fast battery life is adequate  So many things to love  I have two Moto modsthe battery pack 
which I rarely have to use And the JBL speaker which is wonderful  This is by far the best phone I have ever had and Ive had a LOT of phonesI do not want to write in this space I got this phone for my mother in January and she has had nothing but problems since shortly after getting it The biggest issue is the battery life it drops quickly even when not in use Now the phone has a charging issue and will not charge I took it to Verizon and they had a replacement phone sent out and guess what it has the SAME problem She is only 5 months into having the phone so trading it in is not an option at this point unless this one is paid in full so we are stuck getting asking for replacement phones that are not even new they are certified like new My moms last phone was a Motorola and she had no issues with it this Motorola not worth the priceI just got 2 of these phones I have to stand in the middle of the road and calls still cut out every other word called in they got it to improve but now 2 a day it needs to update and I dont have phone coverage again Not worth owning if you cant talk on itGreat Android phone Just switched to it from Samsung S7 Android OS works fine Very little built in apps that hog memory Battery life is SUPER I needed 2 full charges a day on my Samsung S7 Now I plug in my Moto at night with more than 60 charge left Fast charge feature can recharge phone from 60 to full in less than 12 hour Screen is sharp and clear Photos are great Can add micro SD card configured as main memory That means you dont have to manage memory between built in memory and extra micro SD Really recommend this phoneWe have been a family of Motorola phone fans but this one missed the mark Battery life is horrible and that is even with the Kate Spade battery mod The mod only ads maybe two hours to the life of the phone With minimal use my phone lasts about 8 hours with the battery mod My husband got the Force because he has damaged many phone screens in the past and he is having much more luck I know that phone has a better battery but I would expect the one on mine to at least make it through the day It also shuts off between 1020 too Definitely will consider a different brand after this experiencenot happy with it for the price my screen on my camera crackedshattered it freezes on me but on the other hand i love all the extras it does the talking to it and doing it for u is great but i wouldnt buy another onei would seriously look into something else from verizonA far superior product to the Galaxy S7 that also resides in our homeGreat battery for its thin profile but not the world battery champ Fingerprint ID works every time and accepts multiple scans letting you use either hand Just awesomeThis phone is the worst one Ive ever had  Its slow freezes up frequently and has to be rebooted the battery runs hot and shuts the phone down  I loathe it and am so sorry that I traded in my previous phone for this poor replacementThe phone was awesome at 1st  I brought the battery mode and a couple of cases  Loved the feel and look of it  The speed of the phone is great as it plays all my games without any lags  The problems I first noticed were when I was using the bluetooth functions  It seems like every song would have a pause or interruption of some kind This was the case regardless of whether I was using bluetooth headphone or connecting the phone to my car stereo or home speakers  Why would they eliminate the headset jack but then use an inferior bluetooth antennaeThe Motorola Moto Z Droid has been a big disappointment because the camera freezes you cant assign a ring tone to a group or go between the camera and photos  Overall I feel as though Ive taken a step back in technology  

Frustrated and upset I liked my old phone betterMy husband and I got the Moto Z force phones When I purchased this phone I came from a note 3 I wanted the note 7 that they came out with but they no longer offer those nor did they have an note 5 so I decided to try out a Moto Z force 
If you are trying for something to compare to a Samsung this is not the phone I dont like the fact that my phone basically runs off Google everything I have big hands to while holding my phone while typing my fingers touch the glass and that messes with what I am doing My husbands works in a bodyshop he felt this phone would be a good phone to take to work Well his screen is scratched up bad his speaker barley works its crackles 
We bought these phones 6 months ago the speaker shouldnt be gone already
My Samsungs lasted me years Once we can upgrade we will be going back to Samsung I regret wasting my time and money on this phoneThis phone is horrible I bought this phone for my husband and after two months of having it the speaker went bad we returned it and got another one  After having another new cell phone 4 months later the camera started sticking out and I called customer service the guy was so rude and said they couldnt replace itPerfect Always have loved Motorolas products Very reliable devices and great up to date featuresIt took awhile to get used to the new features on this phone was stoked about the turbo charging Ive now had this phone a little less than a month and am disappointed in finding that the battery isnt what I expected Ive recently been having issues with it keeping charge Its been off the charger for 3 hours and am at a 61 charge Thats just idling I dont listen to music on it anymore nor use navigation Its sad because I rave about Motorola phones as Ive always had a great history with them Might be switching to an LGI like that everything is easy to access like files such as insurance proof etc even in a bind or need to access quicklyOnly 2 things with the phone I dont like is the slowness of the rotation Sometimes it take forever to rotate back upright
The battery dont last long as expectedphone service techs are helpful knowledgeable freindly great service in the store Store location is good as wellLove the phone and features with one exception  This phone is supposedly made with Gorilla Glass but my screen cracked in three places with a 14 drop  My former Galaxy S4 had taken multiple drops from heights 34 times as high with no damage to phone or screen  Case options are limited if you plan to use any of the Mods  If you like the phone better opt for the Force model with the Shatter proof screenPhone battery is extremely poor I am being forced to buy car charger if i want 8 hour charge  Lousy service for a 20 year customerThird Motorola phone seamless transition  A camera Minor updates that make for big improvementsI love Motorolas but CDMA versions are difficult to find So when I switched carriers this is the phone that I purchased I am in love with this phone and service Apps download in literally 1 second I will have a BUNCH of apps and services running at the same time and this phone and service can handle it Sometimes if I push too hard the screen will turn off and I have to wait a minute to get back in but that is totally understandable The only issue that I have is the Virtual Keyboard For some stupid reason they included an Emoticon button but when you click it the first time that comes up is flags I mean come on flags So you have to get used the the idea that you might type in a flag This can easily be changed Why not let us customize everything about the keyboard Im not talking about the current edit features I mean EVERYTHING That is okay though In time Other then that the phone is flawless I Love You Motorola and Verizon I rate this phone and 98 out of 10 Well worth itFantastic phone  Smooth to handle  Great pictures  Very thin and I easily moved from an earlier Droid phonePHONE HAS TO MANY SLIDES TO GET AROUND ANSWER PHONE HAS TO MANY SLIDES TO JUST ANSWER PHONE DELETING ALSO HAS TO MANY SLIDES JUST TO DELETE MESSAGES WHEN PHONE RINGS  PHONE ICON SHOWS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAP ICON TO ANSWER DIRECTLYBattery without MOD attached runs down much faster than my previous droid while running same apps Do not like having to us an adapter for earphone would prefer standard plug Projector and camera MODS kinda expensiveWater proof I that show and listen to music at the same time Ive dropped this phone more times then I can count the battery life suck The battery suck it dies to quicklyThis is a great phone I had droid Turbo I was looking for the second generation To find out they stop those I was very scared to get it because of price But so far its been a GREAT phone Pictures are amazing Ill add some The battery life has served as good so far I have had little over a week I work a job that I need to listen to music all day to get though my job I use my phone for that and I work 12 hours or more a day I go home with 30 percentage on my phone I rated it a 4 out of 5 because I still believe its a little high but worth pennyI got it because my sister has one and recommended it I value her opinion This is way more than youll ever get againBe happy with what you gotThis is a great phone and love the Speck cover Note this phone uses USBC connection which is a change from my old phone so had to get all new connectors such as car charger and USBC to USB to connect to laptop and headphones Transition to new phone was super easy Verizon transfers Contacts I just reinstalled AppsDifficult to navigate due to constant pop up notifications Answering the phone was even hard because of thisBeing that I was coming from a very old Motorola phone to a smart phone it was very intimidating but with a little patience it has became a easy transition  Just remember with so many features it will just take time to learn them allI like the phone however Ive noticed when I make a call it almost sounds like Im in a tunnel Reception is usually good otherwise just something I noticed Also sometimes at the edge of the screen it isnt responsive Like when Im texting and try to touch the letter p on the edge it doesnt registerThe phone is amazing It has a great camerastorage is large sound quality is great Definitely would recommend to a family member or friendBluetooth has problems especially in disconnect It disconnects itself and then has trouble finding paired devicesI like how the figure print scanner works Its fast and smooth but the battery life terrible The battery mod is 100 needed to get a full day use out of itGreat phone hard to get use to the size though
The cases are expensive for the phone but overall like it so farStill a little worried about c type charger connection too flimsy seen too make designs fail ex usb ports on previous models

no ear bud plug really need a pigtail to use not everyone uses bluetoothIve only had the phone for a week so I still adjusting   On the plus side the phone charges rapidly  On the negative side to answer the phone I have to slide the phone icon to answer  I want to be able to tap answer  

Also it makes too much noise  beeping vibrating etc  Received 50 text messages from the Verizon network in under 24 hours which turned out to be a network problem Had to mute conversation  Could find nothing online so returned to the store  Fix was in progress 

Its a feature rich phone with some annoyances Let me use it for a while and Ill follow upThe phone is very fast very reliable high quality and it is capable of doing everything I need it to do I am excited to buy and try all of the new modsNot completely satisfied with my phone I find it hard to get around the different apps The cloud transfer of my contact list didnt transfer right Battery life is not an all day thing The salesman talked me out of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I do regret my decision and its too late to exchange phones by 3 daysIts a great phone great quality pictures are awesome its just the battery does not last as long as I was initially told it would I have to put it on the charger 2 to 3 times a dayI like how you can transfer modules so easy to your phone and play music on it sound quality is great no more dropped calls and you can here so clearlyNo doubt the phone is thin and fits into my jacket pocket back slacks or even a shirt pocket super easy  The speed of the processor vs my old Samsung Note 3 is night and day  The screen quality is also vastly better and clear  Not sure if its as good as my 4k TV but sure seems to be  Transfer of all my old data no problem  If there were a gripe I would say that having been used to one way on the Samsung for so long makes doing a transition even tougher but Im getting better at it  Sending pics vs my old method is not as swift but it may again be habit of my old pattern  I simultaneously got a IPHONE 7 when I took a new position with my current employer and it is so much better screen and size for a 54 year old guy  Nice job Motorola  Finally having the extra magnetic accessories to quickly switch to seems exciting  I started with only the excess battery and have already ordered the camera projector and JBL speakers for when Im working or in need of some tunesThe phone opens apps very quickly and with the advanced lte the phone responds quickly to anything I open or browse Has a great battery life and i love having the ability to purchase moto modz such as the jbl speaker and the projector attachment which i think would be awsome during watching netflix videos on my phone and the fact that it will connect to the google daydream vr I also enjoy the stylish magnetic back designs i can put on The phones shatterproof display is a huge plus and its camera takes magnificent photos The front flash was a great touch as well The phone needs a different charger than the original android charger which is a small drawback but i presume thats due to the power it takes to recharge this beast The phone also uses a dongle instead of having a headphonr port but i like listening through bluetooth anyways The fingerprint scanner works extremely fast to open and unlock your device I also enjoy having the ability to wave my hand over the phone to turn the screens active display on and check the time and i also enjoy being able to shake the phone to quickly open the flashlight and rotate the phone repeatedly to quickly open the camera The phone also has 2 lights for the phones rear flash and flashlight producing a substancial amout of light making it easy to see in the dark This phone cobnects to my vehicle very easily and plays my music through spotify immidiately where as on my old galaxy s7 it would constantly open up google play music forcing me to close google play music and reopen spotify All this for about the same price as the iphone 7 I recommend this phone to any true android enthusiast as this phone was built powerful and strongI really expected it to at least be as good as my old phone on battery but drains quickly very disappointedTwo failed phones in less than a month  On original phone after two weeks blue tooth would not work  Replacement was a refurbished unit  we had paid for new phone just two weeks earlier  The second phone went two weeks also  This time the volume and oneoff buttons quit working altogether  Also the volume could not be controlled be the settings function  We are now waiting for number three  NOT HAPPYI love this phone still working on figuring out to use everything but so far pretty impressed I had the Galaxy S7 and hated itIf it were not for the snapon camera I would hate this phone completely Entering a text message every word has missed hit characters Tried to enlarge font in settings and it didnt help at all Having to toggle to another screen to input symbols is a pain Typing in Google search bar sucks I run my business from my phone and the days are very long and unproductive these days Oh and now the Verizon chat box pops up and wants to help me Really Tell Motorola to include an instruction booklet with their overpriced phone Try to find info online forget about itThe moto z is really nice and light the mods for it are amazing the speacker is pretty loud for its size and the projector has pretty good quality and the camera is really good quality too charger mod woyld of been good if i could plug it in cause not everyone has wireless charging only thing i did not like about the phone is that for ear plugs its the same as the charging plugThe moto z is a okay smartphone but the speaker is weak and the battery doesnt last all do even if you really dont use itI dont know if I should return it before the 14 days and get a iphone 7 plus or just keep it and  deal with itThe phone is easy to use very user friendly and anyone could find it very helpful I love the features and what all the phone can and will doI purchase my NEW Motorola MOTO Z in NOvember 2016  It stopped charging 3 weeks ago  it would acknowledge the charger being plugged into the phone  car or home  Tried it in the store  also failed  Returned NEW phone one that I am still making payments on and will continue to do so for over a year and a half and was sent a REFURBISHED Moto  Well three weeks later the REFURBISHED MOTO is once again not charging easily  very erractic  AND the voice commands failing  Verizon has been very unhelpful  I have spent hours on the phone and online with them  i am once again on the phone with them  i am doneThe battery doesnt hold a charge I usually have to charge it mid afternoon after charging it at night Never had that problem with my iPhone The screen is good size I dont think Id recommend it to anyoneNot up to all the hoopla Just OK

Just repeating on purpose to make the 100 character minimum
Not up to all the hoopla Just OKOnce I figured out how to access the settings it was easy to set up and use The only problem is the location of the buttons on the upper right side They are right where you want to hold the phone in landscape positionNo headphone jack Have to take off the case to remove attachments Attachments are difficult to remove Other than that its a great phone Functions excellent and does everything a smart phone should doGood features great battery life Outperformed my old Droid by leaps and bounds Very happy with this purchaseIts a little to big for my liking dont like the different plug the first two rings are really low Hard to answer when other appsMy wife and I both got these phones After her phone getting HOT and getting it traded out everything is fine Very quick and user friendly The options including the fingerprint scanner are awesome Being able to access the flashlight with the double hatchet motion The camera being accessed by flipping the wrist is awesome Highly recommended for any ones upgradeIts a good phone It has alot of cool things to add to the phone like the camera and speakers I would recommend this phoneIt is fast screen easy to ready charges quickly and navigation is easy The battery is not any better than my old Droid Turbo which is the main reason I bought a new phoneso far the battery sucks and the reception was better in my old phone The battery runs down too quicklyWhen talking to people I hear background static also when the phone is ringing on their end I hear static There is a phone number it doesnt like to connect toReally like the phone only thing Im a little set off by is how many updates Ive had to do in just the first week of having itI thought I was upgrading from my LG G3 but is a down grade the phone is slower some Nice and thin And is a good phone EXCEPT the camera glass is fragile about a month ago I took the phone out of its case and the camera glass was broken I am just now posting because I thought Id try to find a replacement NO Not Verizon nor any after market can get the part I have serious doubts whether I will even own another Motorola phone and am seriously considering leaving Verizon for selling products they cant replace partsCons Battery doesnt last near what I thought it would Has a tendency to change my ringtonesnotifications for no reason You have to buy a new charger for it so all of the previous android cords I have do me no good There is no spot for head phones or earbuds have to by a special adapter that goes into the charging port therefore you cannot use earbuds and charge the phone at the same time 

Pros It takes really good pictures The new cord can fully charge my phone from 0 in 15 hours Speaker is pretty good Has a thumbprint lock if you wish to use itI was a little skeptical at first but after getting used to the new phone I really liked it more and more  The processor is great and loads everything very fast  I love the MOTO gesture mod and use it to turn my flashlight on at work or to turn the camera on in a flash to capture that quick spur of the moment photo opportunity that sometimes passes you by when trying to get to the camera through the phone interface  I use the phone all day at work and the battery lasts me all day without needing to charge it but to make sure I never have to worry about it I purchased the battery mod for it  The mods are another great feature and turns the phone into many different devices that can enhance the user experience both personal and professional  The fingerprint scanner to turn the phone on works great and  makes it easy to turn the phone on and off  Overall I think that Motorola did a great job on this phoneI love the new accerorie speaker for when Im taking showers I dont like taking the speaker outside incase I drop it it because I like it so much but its perfect for my me time in the restroom I purchased the battery pack for special trips but I dont think Ill use it much because I LOVE my new otterbox commuter case so much All around I dont have any negative feedback about the new droid Z So far its my favourite android that has come out so far I hope I can use this phone for years to comeWent from a flip phone to the Moto Z DroidVery easy  The Verizon store employee made it simpleCan not imagine an easier conversion IThe Motorola Moto Z is very nice and Im very satisfied with itI like it better than the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge I hadGreat on the battery powerIve had two smart phones in the past A Samsung G3 and G4 They would not last very long and I would need a new battery Evey 4 or 5 months Ive had this Moto Z Play for 2 months now and I like it The battery lasts a long time at least 2 days of constant use Streaming music at work using WiFi and Bluetooth for 8 solid hrs with the battery at 85 The G4 would need a recharge at lunch time just sitting there not doing anything The Moto Z Play has a big display too just as big as my wifes Apple 7 pluss The camera is pretty good too It is every bit as good as the Apple in my opinion for half the price Oh yeah There are some cool Doo dads that can snap on to the phoneI love how all my pictures automatically back up to the cloud I also enjoy how light weight the phone isEasy to use great high def screen Camera takes great pictures crisp videos Like the extra storage optionThis phone is easy to understand I went from a Flip phone to this one I had to have wife and granddaughter help me learn but caught on very fastlove all of the features it has If I could give it  negative stars I would The apps constantly act up and the service and battery life are horrible Thanks Verizon store for recommending such a horrible phoneI am pleased with the device itself and am quickly learning the features since I had a earlier version of Motorola I was so grateful everything got transferred so easily from my old phone I was so glad to find a user manual online for some quick answersMy husband 17 yr old daughter  I were due for an upgrade We had previously owned 2 galaxy s5s  2 galaxy s4s but 3 out of the 4 of them had quit working entirely I was forced to use an old phone which was the Motorola razor that was pretty old but still worked pretty well even though the screen was smashed so I knew I didnt want another galaxy  that I wanted a Motorola phone since they seemed to be made well I had been thinking about getting the moto z but after my husband compared the Samsung s7  the moto z force he decided on the moto z force so all 3 of us ended up with one I love my phone Its made very well  has many awesome features I plan on buying the camera  projector attachments as wellMy last motorla served me well I kept it months pass my upgrade date because it was a good productGreat Android phone  Love the features and accessories  Really easy and smooth transition from iOsMoto Z is an excellent phone  Good size fairly larg but easily pocketable  I was hoping to get the LG V20  This was my second choice but Im very happy  I like the removable memory but wish it had a removable battery too  Camera seems pretty decent  App performance is great  Call and data performance is great  

Moto mods are a nice idea that could be expanded more  No need for a projector  JBL speaker would be better if it also had a Bluetooth option so it could also be controlled from a distance  Hasselblad camera is a nice idea but even though it has a nice zoom it still has a tiny cell phone sized sensor    That just leaves the covers and batteries   Covers offer no added protection for the phone  While they look cool they do nothing  The battery options sometimes include wireless charging but none have a USBC rapid charging plug  I see a lot of potential with mods but nothing that makes me want to rush out and buy it  

I like the ideas on the LG V20 of keeping a spare battery and charger around and then swapping it when I need it and the separate wide angle camera  The Moto Z however doesnt need to be powered off to add a battery mod or any mod for that matter  The user interface on the Moto Z is great  I havent felt the urge to get custom launchers as I did with previous phones  Overall highly recommendLove the Moto z Brilliant color screen with so much to do The only thing is battery life kind drains way too quickThe sales person was very helpful and very courteous  He suggested I add my landline phone which I did and it saved money to do this I love this phonePerfect size and it works like a charm Speaker arent the best but you can purchase the JBL mod for a reasonable priceI was very disappointed in the battery life of this phone  I had to recharge it several times a day  I had a Verizon store look at it and we disabled any apps that could have been draining the battery and I turned off bluetooth wifi while sleeping etc  I switched back to my previous brandI love to use my phone for picture taking So the added memory is nice and it can back them up to Google photos  It also will backup to many other cloud servicesIm frustrated that there is a Daily System upgrade that makes my phone unavailable for 20 minutes at a time and uses my data to process the upgradeLike the phone and the idea of all that it should do The camera has let me down although I do like the flash on selfie mode Having Bluetooth problems when driving Not so safe I hear a weird noise during phone calls considering getting something differentPros Nice looking phone Sound is great when talking on the phone clear and no trouble hearing the person Im speaking with Doesnt ever cut out or drop calls Takes great photos Overall Im pleased with it 

Cons I dont like that it wakes up constantly and reacts to my every move I really feel like its spying on me Im in the habit now of placing it face down on the table so I dont see it waking up all the time Battery runs out by the end of the day if Im using several apps I use a card reader for my business and plugging it in to the flexible cord adaptor is not the best system for swiping cards I miss the headphone jackI expected it to have more features  to be more advanced especially with the money I spent I VERY much REGRET buying this phone  will NEVER by a Motorola phone again Its a cheap unimpressive phone Im telling everyone NOT to buy oneI really like the phone I enjoy being able to wave my hand over the phone and the time pops up The HD voice is so cool It sounds like the person is sitting next to you when youre talking to them I also like the camera It takes really nice pictures Im not so happy with the no headphone jack You have to get Bluetooth headphones if you want to listen to music while your phone is charging I also had to return two of these phones because the battery drained fast So far the third phone I have has a good amount of battery My last phone drained from 100 to 85 in one hour Overall the phone is pretty good other than the battery issueWe looked at the Moto Z Droids We have always had the Samsung Galaxies We were hesitant to make the change However the more we looked at the Moto Z the more interested we were So we took the plunge and my husband and I both got the Moto Z  We both love them They are easy to use since we are already used to androids and the clarity of the screen is awesome The size is perfect The phone makes great pictures We got a great deal and also got cases for both phones while we were there We are happy happy happyWe love our new phones Easy to use and has great functionality Would recommend the Moto z to all of my friendsI dont like that it didnt come with more accessories or that  you cant charge it and listen to music at the same time I dont like that the adapter is an attachment that you need toI decided to update my LG with the Moto Z  My wife has had this phone and found that it was a superior calling tool compared to LG  However because it does not have a hole to insert a jack to a headphones you are to use an adapter that plugs into the jack and that will plug into the same space as the charger

So I purchased a Bluetooth device to bypass the need to block the chargerI was unable to pair my new phone with my Lexus Bluetooth and drove my car to the dealership for their assistance  After their nonsuccess for over an hour I drove to the Verizon store for their assistance  Again having no success it was eventually determined that I had received a defective phone  The replacement was quickly paired with my car by Verizon  I had some questions as I struggled with my learning curve on other features such as copycut and paste to the Clipboard that I couldnt find online  But eventually I was able to figure that and other issues I had and it is getting easier to use nowMy only issue is that the phone does not have an additional  port for the 
headsetear bud only
You have to have an attachment to use head accessories which is included with the package  One port is utilized for allI traded the Google pixel 5 inch in for the Moto Z droid only because of the size of the screen The phone does lag compared to the pixel and lacks a few features such as Google assistant The battery life is not so great but the phone is super slimIt was pretty easy to move from the Samsung 4S to Moto Z The only thing I do not like is the size It is too big to put in a pocket The Samsung had a better sizeThe phone is great A definite improvement over my Galaxy S5 I really like the fingerprint scanner The lack of a physical home button took some getting used toProduct and Service is ahead of the game Everything you need from homebusinessor personal use at your fingertipsexactly as described to me not an over priced phone with a better camera than a samsung  ease of useUpsold this phone and dont care for it Battery life isnt any better than the previous one Not worth itThere were a few things that didnt transition smoothly The day after I bought the phone it went through multiple updates I was not expecting this Battery life was aweful but has resolved Email transition was problematic but seems to have resolved itself as well I lost my textsSomehow my wifi was turned off and it has cost me almost all my data two weeks early Not real happy about thatThe store and customer service have been responsiveThis phone is great  It has a great display and takes excellent pictures  The phone features and controls are excellent  I am very impressed  This is my first droid but wont be my lastEasy to use I think it is a bit clunky but otherwise a good phone The screen colors are vibrant and the sound quality is goodIm still learning the different features as I go I like the size of the phone I also like the batterys quick charging timeSo what if theres a family emergency yet theres some outage and the phone cant be used Makes me question the reliability of the service you offerThe device is awesome just a little to big Cant fit it in my pocket Battery life is great so farSwitching from an phone little challenging at first but now am loving it Love the camera great pictures easier to get apps like the sizeToo many adds and drop calls never get over three bars nice phone like the sides of it but its not a real AndroidExcellent phone  Love the clearness of the screen and the brightness it affords Love the features the phone has to offer  Great productHave nothing bad to say about it and would get another one for my wife and daughter and tell everyone to get oneThis phone works in my metal building which is great  I dont loss service as easy as before And I can answer it without hanging up on the person callingI am not getting as strong a signal as I did with my previous Droid Turbo Messages are getting hug up not delivered Pandora does not work as smoothly as with the previous unit Minor plus  are the thinness of the unit and longer battery life  However I have several chargers in home office and car so it is not that big a plusThe instructions are too technical and difficult to understand  The camera is like this question  What do you want add photo add video My biggest issue is the rejectanswermessage button Its going to take some getting used toas Im used to being able to swap in either direction
I do really like the phonehave gotten asked what phone is THATI cant believe how fast the Droid ishow responsive it is  I have had Samsung products for years and now You can not pay me to have another Samsung phone
It just wont happen The pixels are betterits so much faster it charges so much faster as well its amazingIt is good to have stateoftheart technology at my fingertips Switching from a slidephone to this Droid has been relatively simpleThe phone works perfectly it is better that Motorola droid turbo that I had I would recommend the Moto Z to a friendThis phones sucks bad it slow it keeps making everything on the the phone big like its in zoom all the time takes forever to type in number so like the galaxy betterWasnt sure what to expect and I am still getting used to it Mostly I had to get used to new placement on features I love that the hot spot is not an app anymore but a setting like WiFi or bluetoothIt is moving slowly  Need tutorial session  Should offer a session and some staff should be able to answer inquiries and be more accommodating especially to elderly who are trying to keep updatedHad it 2 weeks Still cant figure out how to screenshot Other than that everything seems to be OK Does the job very well I use it every day for work Basic functionality nearly mirrors my Samsung g4I got this phone because I got a good price on it I had a Samsung Note 3 for about 3 years and it was finally starting to get herky jerky on me I like the Note better because everything on it seemed more logical for someone who is not a techie Maybe in a couple of more months I might grow to love this phone but right now we only have a Luke warm relationshipThe phone was easy to learn how to do things I love the big screen It is also faster than any phone that I have had It also takes beautiful and sharp picturesI dont like the notifications process  Its awkward and requires multiple steps to get to the information which defeats the point of the notification short cuts  Its also particular on the action required to answer the phoneagain the point of the entire productThe great fastest way to get any information related to daily basics easy to use and understand SZI loved my previous LG phone but it just shut down one day When I took it into the Verizon store they had trouble getting into it Then it just rebooted as if a new phone When I said that I needed to be able to rely on the phone because of my job I was handed this Moto Z Droid I wasnt too enthusiastic because I had had an earlier version that had not been a good experience At least I got started quickly but Im not a fan of the keyboard and Im having trouble getting completely connected to my office Outlook especially the Contact list Hard to explain but I miss the phone that crashedMy Moto Z Droid seems to be keeping a charge longer than my previous phone  I also like how thin and lightweight it isI need to upgrade and since I drive with a ride share company now was the time I can switch between both apps in the split screen mode Love this feature Keep me current with surges and prime time Love love love my Moto Z DroidFirst smart phone and love how easy it is to use
The camera is good also 
Just love this phone Great deal and so glad I bought itI have had this phone since August of this year and so far I am on my 3rd replacement Each phone has corrupted more then one SD card and with each one once the corrupting of the memory card happens thats when it all of a sudden the phone will not ring no notifications go off no alarms Nothing Verizon and Motorola have been no help what so ever besides lets try yet another factory reset lets try clearing your cache for the ten millionth time O OK lets send u out another replacement So now I am stuck with this phone for almost 2 years I am paying all this money for a phone that has never worked properly due to no fault of my own and apparently its never going to work properly You would think Verizon would care more about their customers satisfaction and provide them with phones that actually work or at least try to give them more options when it comes to that same issue with 3 of the same phones in less then 6 months Situations like this they should make an exception and allow the customers to switch to another device under warranty Not asking for ya know a newer high end phone I would rather have a downgraded phone that actually does what it supposed to then deal with one that doesntVery fast phone and the battery last for days Love compare to other phone This phone is much bigger which is a good things Last phone I had I had to take Apps off because it was to slow but this phone is 32g Love itThe best phone I have ever owned Will stick with this product cause I trust it and trust in a product these days is so hard to come by When my Moto G3 which is an old model ran out of room I went straight for another Motorola phone Thanks Motorola I bought one Moto Z Play for me and one for my brother and I tell everyone about its featuresJust upgraded my phone other one was old and would not hold a charge all day  My new Moto Z has speaker problems it has crackling and you can not hear  Verizon rep has ordered me a new one  Taking more of my time to go back and get the new phone  Phone somes with several apps that I will never use  Wish I could pick which apps I wantThis phone has the worst battery life of any phone Ive ever used  If you only use your phone for calls and text messages the battery life is fine but if thats the case you dont really need a smart phone  If youre using features that justify having a smart phone the battery life is not going to be sufficientI was set on getting the Galaxy S7 as my upgrade from my S5 which was an upgrade from the S3 Loved my Galaxys  After seeing this phone and doing the research I decided to go with it instead Ive been very happy with the choiceGreat phone for the price So far I am happy with all its features And I love how big the screen is I am able to read my text messages with no problemsTook away many simpler features that my Samsung 5 phone had had a better speed dial feature better way to figure out the phone better photo gallery cannot figure out how to use my external SD card instead of one step things take 2 or sometimes 3 steps Snapfish doesnt recognize the pictures from my phone only the whats app ones Took a long time for the video feature to get a clear pictureHad to press the button countless timesI hate this phone only like big screen I cant upload my pics only download not able charge and lusten to headset is not obtion unless you have wirelessStill learning how to use features that differ from my old Samsung S4  I need to add thirty characters to make this an acceptable review  StupidI like the phone but the volume for me is to low and seem to have less ring tones choices Didnt take me long to get use to itMiss several features of the galaxy s4 such as keyboard shortcut from camera to gallery Battery life about the same as my galaxys4 extended life batteryAfter I heard the advertising for the Moto Z Droid I took my granddaughter with me to check it out  We were so impressed she got one tooMoved to Verizon after a long time with ATT Very happy so far with coverage Love my new Moto Droid Z Still playing with all the features but love AndroidI like the new Moto Z droid alot I switched from the Moto X 2nd Gen I like the fingerprint option the best it speeds up getting into the phoneTalking sure seems a lot clearer on this phone than the Moto X also I guess time will tell if holds upAbsolutely love the Moto Z Droid battery lasts a long time lots of storage just a great phone all togetherThe Moto Z droid is amazing It exceeds all of my expectations it really is a mini computer in my hands The camera quality is wonderful and I can multitask with multiple apps running at once with no problem in performance Only draw back is the battery life but if you keep apps closed then that helpsPhone syncs with my spouses  dont care for that  Wish that could be kept separate otherwise its okayI havent had a cellphone in 15 years so this is my first one  I didnt have any problems getting it working and using it right away  Im very happy with itI have had several Motorola phones in the past that is why I chose the Moto Z It was an easy transition since I knew the brand wellGreat features great cameraSound is goodLooks and feels great
Droid is Z greatest phone so far Better than that fruit phone LolChallenging to find correct texting and voicemail apps Pre installed apps want to charge a service fee to use Camera functions slow Most base phone apps dont have settings in app to customize Size is a little large for my hand Calls sound tinnyi like the speed of the phone battery life is good i feel it could use more storage space or to be able to use the SD better idk over all AI bought this phone because of the price  The fast processing is fine It runs my business Apps that I need to have  I HATE that I cannot transfer my music as easily as I did on my Samsung  I STILL DO NOT have a way to play the music  I have to download an App to  do that  Samsung provided an available app  Also HATE the phone does not come USB connector ready or have a builtin ear phone jackFantastic graphicsflash for camera is much better than my previous phone Easy to set up and transfer data Love how fast it chargesLove the camera and figuring most things out Not used to it yet n lost in some areas All n all its a nice phoneA bit of a learning curve for seniors but overall a great product A bit large for old hands but best size of new designs available 
Camera is awesome and Moto Z Droid addons are wonderfulThere were a few things that took some getting used to but overall very similar to my Samsung Galaxy Note 4As Im now used to it I like it quite a bit  The screen is really large but the width dimension is similar to my older phone so it still fits into pockets that the old one fit into There have been almost daily system updates which is getting old but Im sure that will eventually end It is an improvement over my old phone which was a good phoneSwitch from iPhone to Android  very happy  size of phone makes it easy to read  like touch screen where you can preview messages  Sound quality when talking on the phone much improvedThe phone is amazing but idk it keeps turning on and off same thing with the speakers but other than that the phone is amazing I love it I had an iPhone I dont think I would go back to the Iphone any time soon i love my motoThis phone is fast and easily programmable It is very thin and light weight With the expandability of the clip on options this phone can do so much moreThis phone is pretty niceSo far I like it I love the service the price and overall experience with VerizonThe only problem Ive noticed about this phone is its tendency to drop its WiFi connection Other than that Im very pleased A great phoneThe Motorola Droid and Android system are keeping up with the times and providing a competitive choice for the Apple products which the rest of my family prefer   

The Moto Force upgrade was offered at a special halfprice now apparently being reduced even further so that made the move a smart one on my part

Something is always lost in the transition and it took me a few days to bring my new phone up to the comfort level of my old one downloading the dozens of apps that did not get delivered from the cloud during the activation and learning on my own how to transfer the ringtones from my old phone via a bluetooth connection 

Now the phone seems to be working well perhaps a little faster than the old one with sharper videos and photos The bothersome promotions for Verizon addons and other products are about to end so I can settle into just using the phoneAs a new user of a smartphone it is a little overwhelming and We do not have our grandkids to help us  We are slowly overcoming all the phones capabilitiesMost of my apps timeout after 5 minutes  Amazon Musicetc Always in driving mode cannot answer phone always updatingThe Moto z droid is my new favorite phone The graphics on it are amazing in every game It also has great speed in its processing so that it doesnt hang up on random apps The bonus to all of it is the attachments that you can get I cant wait to get my projector I have heard nothing but good thingsno instructions and everything is different than my old droid max having a very hardtime trying to figure out how to do the basic functionsI love how the phone runs with no problems whatsoever  I will be getting my wife the same phone because of how much I enjoy mineCamera isnt the best I dont like that there isnt a home button Also not a fan of gold but they were out of black I like the screen sizeOnce learned how to use this phone is  pretty easy to manage Down side is no head phone jack for ear buds have to Bluetooth or use cable providedIve always had Motorola but this phone by far is the worst The battery may charge fast but who cares when it sucks the life out of battery just as fast Cant have all the apps on this phone like other phones Ive had Cant turn the text notification down because its same volume as ringer not separate First day I had to do a factory reset Should have gone to an iPhone as much as I am against it Motorola going downhillNew phone seems okay but the gallery doesnt work like my last Moto and the photos dont send in normal texts and then my phone is sending messages only sometimes most stay in que and never are delivered BummerI dont likee that Facebook or whoever beeps every time there is an announcement  Dont know how to cancel the beeps  Will get help when I see my grandsonOverall Im very happy with my new phone I prefer androids and this model fits my needs and wantsCant be used as a remote control and it doesnt a preinstalled voice recorder Refer a calculator like the one in the LG3 Okay besides that its a phoneLove this phone the advancement s that come with this phone are great and I love how u can change the phone the way u likeStill learning how to use it  My grandchildren are very helpful in teaching me  So far I am enjoying the learning how to use all the featThis phone is very light and thin but has a large screen that is great for watching videos or reading Easy to recommendGreat service phone works great people was friendly they did everything help change over from Sprint thanksMy Turbo 2 took a bath and I was gonna get another but couldnt find one Was told this was comparable Totally not No wireless charging and very touchy keypad Not happyIt has been easy to get use to I still havent learned everything about the phone yet The only thing I didnt like is it didnt come with accessories like the camera or speaker or a phone chargerCome with no instructins and does not acess features like other previous systems have No speed dial unless you count toughing a recent call as speed dial Does not come with Message app and the contact feature is totally messed up No ease of accessI like the Z but Im hoping with time I will love it Some issues the arose since I bought it continuous system updates sometimes more than once in a day some apps wont work that did work on previous smart phone closing applications via the small square at the bottom of the screen until the most recent update number 6 or 7 now I had to swipe every single app to closeend it but now it offers the close all option at the top I do wish I had the option for a smart case but that is probably being petty

Pros I very much like the fingerprint lockunlock love the option for mods I havent used one yet but plan to camera takes beautiful pictures and sound clarity is superior 

I did speak to a technician about the continuous updates and they recommended taking it back and getting a replacement this was the third day I had it but I havent had a chance yet Today is day 10 and the system updates have slowed down but still some technical issues from time to time Other than that I am very glad I chose the Z droidUse my phone primarily for business and it meets or exceeds all requirements This is my 6th or 7th smartphone and nothing I have had even begins to compareMy previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy 4 This phone is much larger and utilizes the new USB C connection  charging unit so all of my cables from the past dont work anymore and I find that aggravating Finally there is no headphone jack and this trend of having to go to wireless earbuds is I also find bothersome All of this being said the phone itself delivers as it was advertised Great priceI really like that I can add a memory card couldnt in the turbo Moto Z does way to many updates though I had it a week and it did 5 system updates Battery life isnt as long as the Turbo either It is a great size and wide viewing screen Overall it is a good phonedata useage  used up to fast I like the size and it is easy to use sound is very good very clear no problems with this phone yetOverall a very fine phonenot enough battery storageseems to be very durableno issues so far  been a year a little spendyEasy transition Easy to sync with my car and to get back on line with email and Facebook Love the new red caseIt would be helpful if it had a builtin Notepad capability of assigning different notification tones for contacts social media and emailas of now notifications are all the same toneI have to check my phone each time it goes off to see what it is Also would like a port to plug in headphones that I dont need a convertertoo many updates everyday is ridiculous plus too many apps that I dont want or will use guy at Verizon when I went back was very condescending to me and didnt get all my answers If using an app very hard to answer phone screen keeps changingI am in a learning curve This is my first smart phone so Im learning how to text and all the other features the phone has to offer I am a little hard of hearing and the sounds even turned up to max is a some what softIm trying to find out if it has a feature that the phone lights up to signal an incoming call  text or email so far no luck Ive only had it for a week or so but it is still a work in progress I have not used the camera yet and I hope it is great as it was one of the main reasons I went to the smart phoneThere is not a cord to connect the phone to my computer  What a misstep by design  When changing things make them better  I cant use my ear phones and recharge the phone at the same time  Why  When transferring from one phone to another it screws up too many things  Just transfer what is on the phone and dont try to be cutsie I do like this phone better than my previous phone but not every change is an  improvement  Remember that not everyone is a techy and not everyone wants changes just to impress everyone that they can change the programs  Have had major problems with the length of the charge of the batteryGreat phone except it will not let you answer 12 of the calls goes to message also one day it would not charge until it completely ran downWeve been Verizon customers for over 15 years The service has always been reliable and customer service very goodDont like locked front screen Tried to look up on how to get that off and cant find the answer Battery life is barely a day Learning where to find information Unhappy with the charging cordStandard battery drains quickly on standby and worse after 2 phone calls The ear speaker sound is terrible during phone calls Overall temperature is hot when in a pocket Some apps simply disappearLove my new phone This is my 3rd Motorola Droid and couldnt be happier One draw back about the phone it does ring very loud Even with ringer up all the way is not loud Some might call that a plus thoughNice phone so far but has a vibration when listening on the phone Battery life seems lots shorter than the Droid Turbo I hadEasy to use Great screen size Good battery life Needs a battery charge after 36 hours or so Love the updates after purchase Really made the phone work so much betterLong battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery lifeThe Moto Z has great features and it was easy to transfer the settings and data from my old phone  When I needed to contact the Chat Room prior to ordering the phone they were extremely helpful in answering my questionsThe transition from the Galaxy S4 to the Moto Droid Z has been challenging even though they both are Android devicesit iok why should I the thing will never change I like to have chargers all over not take the same one all the timeMy biggest complaint is the size Its way too big just like the rest of them I might as well hold my tablet up to my ear The battery drains quickly and the charger is a joke I cant use the charger in my car because the plug doesnt disconnect from a USB cable so I cant plug it into my cars USB port to charge which is necessary given the horrible battery life The charger isnt travel friendly either because the prongs dont fold into itself to keep it from jabbing into everything in my bag Near as I can tell they dont even make a car charger for this phone It seems technology is moving backwardsThe phone is easy to use and maneuver through  Any questions you van find right on the phone Takes great pictures and videosIts a good phone but I miss the old phone that was 4 years old and also a droid I dont think its a lot of difference between themI had Iphone 5 and Samsung Note and Galaxy This Moto Z is the best phone I ever had Tin  powerfulI like the phone quite a bit Still taking a while to get used to where everything is I quite like the feature of double flipping or double shaking to get some features to come Especially the flashlightThe customer service really help me they were very helpful and friendly Really helpful Had all the answers to my questionI love the phone I just do not understand why the notification volume is tied into the volume I had to block most of mine to have my volume up fullEnjoyed getting back to the moto from a Samsung Galaxy All the great things I lovedo about the moto x plus the projector that can be attached to the back battery pack and morePhones screen constantly turns on when something get near it and kills the battery Did not realize there was no head phone jack Speaker mod isnot loud enough to for anythingThe phone is great The screen is large and the high definition looks like its high definition However the first time I dropped the phone the screen cracked The sales agent told me it was shatter resistant When I took it back to the sales agent he was incredibly surprised The phone charges fast and the battery seems to drain fastUpgraded to the Z since I had the X Smooth transition as the software is pretty much the same The size is the only bad thing It is 55 inches and stretches the thumb muscles when holding it The X was the perfect size Also do not like that there is no holster with a clip on it for this phone I use the Map My Walk app and clipping my phone to a pocket was perfect Over all a good phone and will not be returning itThis phone is great it has great features design  Light weight  Easy to use  I am very pleased w this phone  Wish I could have purchased soonerI bought this a few days before Christmas when the charger port quit workingThe young man who helped me was very knowledgeable and helped me get a phone as similar to my onld phone as possibleNot too thrilled with this phone 
Wish my old Samsung note 4 had benn more waterproof 
And this is too expensiveEmail links do not forward or open tab to link Still trying it out Battery life is only a little over 12 hours not the advertised 40 not any better than my old phone May not keep it based on aboveHavent had this phone very long but its already my favorite By far the fastest phone I have ever used The battery life is amazing no longer have to carry a phone charger on me at all times The screen is the perfect size takes great pictures I havent had the chance to use any of the Moto Mods yet but the phone by itself is perfectI got two of these and both have miserable battery life which was the primary reason I was upgrading from phones my wife and I have had for many years  With absolutely no usage the battery loses its charge completely in less than a dayWanted a good phone with good service and was told this phone had dual antennas and was excellent for the area I lived in That is a joke continually have lost calls or can not make a call I will say that camera is about the only thing on phone that has been true to its wordIm still learning all of the features on my phone but really enjoy the larger screen and the ease of going from one app to the next Im really glad I decided to upgradeThis phone is great except for the fact that the LCD breaks if you look at it wrong Ive had my phone since august and since then I have had to replace the LCD 4 times One of those times was my fault I dropped my phone that one time but the other 3 Ive just woken up and the screen wasnt functional Also I am extremely unhappy with Motorolas customer service They have lost me as a customer If you do get this phone do yourself a favor and get the insurance plan with Verizon so that you DONT have to deal with MotorolaThis phone is great but I noticed the touch screen isnt always that sensitive Sometimes I have to tap something several times for it to work Also there have been a few occasions where the screen acts funny It will oscillate rapidly between a couple different displays like its malfunctioningI got this phone dec 23rd and I am about to say officially I hate it It keeps freezing and my Bluetooth will not connect or work with anythingI got it because I was told it was the most durable Considering how many times the back has popped off I really dont consider this phone durable And the battery has to be charged at least twice a day which is very unexpected for me considering I use this phone less than the Turbo I replaced  barely charged it once a day I also dont like the size its too bigI have had about a week The only thing I dont like is the text messaging The ring tone only plays a few bars of the toneI like the size of the phone and the camera but the battery doesnt always charge properly It will be plugged in but does not read the original charger I also do not like the fact the charging cord is an actual plug not adapter and cord like other phonesmakes traveling with in car airplanes etc a hassleThis phone is a little more complex for me than my Moto Y so its been slower to use for me  The original phone I received had to be returned to Verizon after an update left it in a bootloader loopIts a perfectly nice phone It functions as expected I like that it has 4gb of ram But whats missing is a bit in note pad music player and photo gallery I have to get these through Google Play store and they all come with ads Very annoyingHave had problems with this phone since I got it First people couldnt hear me when I called them or when they called me  Then the touch buttons wouldnt work Then I couldnt hear people when on blue tooth  Tried to return it but it was too late  Got it at Best Buy  They did not match Verizons extended return holiday policyI had been told they did but Verizon was wrong because when I tried to return it to Best Buy they said only 14 days on cell phones period  I will never buy another phone from Best Buy again I am stuck with this phone for 2 yearsI bought this phone over two months ago It a birthday gift to myself Best decision ever  Love the ease of use and the battery life is phenomenal Everything you could want in a phoneFor all the hype smart phones get I expected a lot more when I purchased my first one  My Yahoo email is not compatible with the Android operating system  And speaking of the OS I get almostdaily system upgrades that shut down my phone for up to half an hour  Every time I turn around the phone is asking me to track my location which is very distracting and unnecessary  So far the only application I have downloaded is Facebook and the newsfeed is horrendously fragmented  It doesnt work anything like the regular web site  I dont know if this is due to the Android OS or the application but either way its not very friendlyThis phone is way too Googled for me to enjoy  Third auto update locked it up with Moto voice error which I dont use  Had to factory reset  No photo gallery wants them on Google cloud apparently  And Google search  bar cannot taken off every page  Beyond intrusive do that many people want the photos stored off their phones  Do that many people not feel like idiots talking to inanimate objects to operate them  Using what little free time I have trying to learn how to go back to how my droid x operatedIm glad my previous phone an LG G3 bit the dust  Ive been looking for a valid reason to get a new fancy phone Ive had my Moto Z Droid for a week and Im loving it It is very slim fast looks cool and has a gorgeous screen I bought the JBL speaker mod which sounds decent and works well Im considering getting the zoom camera mod next  The turbo battery charger is super fastThe phone is fast and has nice features but its too big to fit in to any pocket and I hate that it does not have a headphone jack Honestly Thinking of returning itI have been using the Moto Z for about 3 weeks now I got it as a replacement for my first gen Moto X First this phone is huge Unlike the Moto X which had a gorgeous handfitting form factor this thing is big and flat I wasnt sure if I was going to keep it for that reason it doesnt fit in any pocket and is hard to dial with one hand I decided to give it a trial though because I do love Moto and really didnt want an iPhone or Samsung So I nicknamed it Toast since it is like talking on a piece of toast Day 1 I drive to work and when it wouldnt fit in cup holder I put it in another slot near me First time I hit the brakes Giant phone flies out of the slot on to the floor I am aggravatedToast was toast I was going to return it at the very next opportunity But as I continued to use it that day we continued to bond its large screen a gift to my presbyopic eyes the wristtwist camera feature I cant live without and how it talks to me while I am drivingWell it was hard to figure out just what phone I would trade it in for if I did return it I could go back to Moto X small but after a few weeks with my new friend Id have a hard time with those tiny little icons Bottom line I decided to keep it and BTW LOVE my red Incipio Dualpro case which gives it a slightly metallic space age look I hope that Moto comes out with a slightly smaller phone soon and that will be a happy medium Until then a toast to ToastI got this when I needed to quickly replace the Turbo1 I had dropped and the display separated from the screen but the glass didnt crack I need something durable and this was suggested by the salesman I dont like that its larger than the phone I had  But more than that I HATE that the back keeps coming off Ive already nearly lost it at least 3 times The only reason to get this phone is if youll use the Mods frequently I also dont like the fingerprint reader I like the idea of it but like many other people I keep trying to use it to get to the home screen In this day of multipurpose its stupid to have a button only exist for 1 reason especially when people might not even use the featureI bought this phone after my Droid Turbo screen was seriously damaged since it was basically a newer version of the same phone  So far I am disappointed as the battery doesnt last very long and nearly every day it is requiring a 20 min update  Also despite being just another Motorola Droid style phone it requires a different charger than my Droid Turbo so now I will have the additional cost of buying another car charger and charger to leave at work  Other than that it is basically the same phone with a few different features or slight variance to the looks of the old TurboBattery drains fast Even took it back to the Verizon kiosk and he suggested turning battery saver on turn off Bluetooth and location It still drained down Its fully charged when I go to work and I dont even use it until I go to lunch By then its usually about 30 left If it continues I will want an exchangeThe phone is nice and works good but its hard getting over the notifications not being loud at all  Its set at highest volume and sounds like my old phones lowest volume  Texts come through and I never hear them  Frustrating and may have to leave this phoneit is easy phone to use4th Droid Ive owned and this by far has the worst batter life of them all  It barely lasts a full day and that is with little use  Only bright side is it charges fully in about an hourMuch easier to find in my purse keyboard for texting is better than my old phoneSo its a pretty sweet phone I gotta admit But the battery life is horrible If I do anything Ill have to charge it every hour and a half to two hours which is ridiculous I dont even think itll last a full day without a chargeTried to download pictures and only half of them downloaded  The camera takes more than one shot at a time  When talking to others phone sounds fuzzyJust got it from a flip phone easy to useHad a week now and just love itI bought the Moto Z phone right about 1 week ago I love the camera and the video which I had told the guys at the store were most important to me I also like how sensitive the screen is and the movement features

 I do not like some of the messaging features The keyboard is not as easy to use as the Galaxy I had before I also liked the short cuts better for messaging favorites on my GalaxyBought this phone under duress after my Droid Turbo took a bath Hate the fact that the chargers are not universal so had to get new ones Battery life is shorter than my Turbo was The only real plus is that it is lighter weightOverall a good phoneRead a few reviews about the Moto Z all very good so I decided to make the change from my prior trend of Galaxy S phones to Motorola Took a little adjustment to get use to some functional differences but overall very happy with my decision Great camera quick processoperation slim size with a very nice 55 screen I would and have recommend this phone to friendsI just went from an IPhone to the moto z  I thought it would take some adjustment  Wrong no problem using the new phone  Easy easy easy  I found an otter box cover and screen saver for it and now Im all set Go anywhere do anythingEnjoy phone just the direction are hard to understand for certain functions have been back to store several times for help which the store was very helpfulHave only had this phone for a week but Im very happy with it so farFirst phone when I bought it only lasted 4 days and locked up and would not factory reset so had to exchange for new one So far this one is okWas on Iphone 5s platfotm for a job and changed employment Had an LG lucid 2 I was going to activate to establish a new  for myself The associate at the Verizon store showed me the special going for Christmas and the difference in monthly expenses was 11 dollars more than originally budgeted So glad I upgraded Learning the Android based phone is still ongoing but I do like the phone overall Hello MotoI thought the battery would last longerThe MotoZ Droid phone is excellent better than my old Moto Droid One thing I would mention though is that the Moto Z doesnt seem to keep the battery power quite as long as the old Moto Droid It may be because I play many games on it which I didnt play on the old Moto DroidI am very happy that I bought itHappy with the new phone can play with settings Easy transition all material transferredIts a nice phone Bigger screen Great pictures Have had phone 1 week and it has done 3 updates 
Phone is also very slick I would suggest getting a case same day as buying phoneBought this to replace Droid Maxx and was super easy to transitionCell phone is nice enough but a battery hog Screen brightness is less than my 2 year old Moto G Moto actions are niceIve had this my FIRST EVER Smartphone for 10 days now I dont understand the big deal By the time I get to the correct screen to do what I need to do I could have performed the task THREE times already with my basic flip phone All  I have to do is breathe by the phone and it changes screens I dont like itI love this phone  Its very fast its powerful it doesnt come with a lot of unwanted programs that you cant uninstall  The modular components are just icing on the cake since the phone can really stand along without them  I got the battery pack mod and I really like how it can be setup to float the main battery at 80  It lasts really long that way  I dont have a case on the phone right now and Ive dropped it a few times without any damage  Seems to be very well made and sturdy  The screen resolution is pretty amazing all my photos and games look incredibleit was an easy move from my Motorola Maxx to my new Motorola Z Moto I love the new phone and its security features are awesome something I didnt have before  I feel more secure with this phone than any in the past and there have been many  I have had three Motorola phone over the past 22 years and feel they are the best cell phones Ive hadThis was a gift to replace an LG phone on its last legs Between the Google account restore process and the Verizon Cloud backup it was pretty easy to get all the contacts SMS messages phone call history and media moved to the new phone So far its great bigger screen better camera and a much better telephone some smartphones are pretty good computers but not much as far a  phone goes The Moto phones are pretty solidi wish it had features like the samsung S6 its not user friendly as my s6 was miss itGreat Phone transferring data from my previous phone was a pain it was so much better the time before I lost so much data Very difficult to pair with the head phones Love MBI waited to buy a new phone and Im so glad I got the Moto Z Droid It is sleek and so efficient The battery life is amazing I charged it to 100 about 10 am on Friday left work in vegas about noon used the navigation on and off during my drive to LA and made a few phone calls and I didnt even reach below 20 when I charged it it the next morning at 10 amI really like it nice big screen and very fast and love that the battery stays charged along timeTransition was cool from my Moto X and the Nugget software updated shortly after purchase seem to lost some of my battery life from original purchase date so have to configure my apps and data usage to get back to normal battery usage but other than that all working well so farMy old phone had died on me and I paid off my old phone to get this new one  I am very pleased with this phonePerfect phone for me Love itI bought the Moto Z about a week ago I love itGreat phones with really nice features Still trying to figure out the Photos but overall pleasedI have used Droid phones for years and was looking forward to upgrading my line with another and opted for the Moto Z  I knew it was going to be a good phone because Ive always had good luck with Moto but this one is far better than Id hoped for  The battery life is the best Ive ever had in a smart phone but the real eye opener was the call quality  Ive had people ask if Id gotten a new phone because the call quality was clear and strong  From my end the earpiece is excellent and I have moderate tinnitus  The processor is strong and responses from apps are very quick  The screen is large and easy to see touch is sharp and responsive and the case is thin so it doesnt feel like Im carrying a brick or a potato  Overall the phone is very intuitive and easy to use  Ive been carrying mobile phones for twentyfive years and this is probably the best Ive hadI wouldnt recommendShort learning curveYAY
NO HEADPHONES JACKBOOOWasnt sure how Id like it but so far Im loving it Great display fast and powerful extra storage good camera Only problems I can see is the lack of a headphone jack which I can learn to live without Ive tried an adapter off Amazon and it works so Ill just need to keep a few spares around Only other issue is the inability to rearrange the navigation buttons like I could on my LG I wish Google would get with the program on that its an easy fixThe second day l had the phone the camera stopped working and asked me to restart the camera app This appears to be an existing problem with this phone which does not yet have a good diagnosis or answer I had to do a complete factory reset to get access to the camera again Im currently hanging onto my old phone in case I have to return the new one I also had difficulties backing up my old phone onto my new one but thats probably mostly on me Ill try to return and edit this as I learn moreBought just over a week ago can finally update my apps and see what Ive been missing Battery life isnt as great as I wish it would be but still ALOT better than my old phoneEverything I expected and then some Very fastMuch better than my last phone Battery lasts days Lots of features to learnI HAVE VOLUME AT 100 AND STILL CANNOT HEAR THE PHONE RING OR NOTIFICATION ALERT IF I AM DO NOT HAVE THE PHONE RIGHT NEXT TO MEI always went with HTC but have not been impressed with the last two generations I loved my HTC Maxx but it was starting to finally mess up I was looking at the Google phone as it is manufactured by HTC but ultimately decided on the Moto Z droid I have never had a motorola phone but it is made by Lenovo which made me decide to go with it instead of the Samsung It is a great phone extra slim design fast charging super clear photos and functionality is so easy I got the Moto Z Droid Play for my daughter lets see how she likes after she opens it tomorrowI have had the phone for a week Its no Samsung thats for sure For 999 a month and with the mods I am still happy With the battery mod with 3000 mAh battery you can 
play 8 hours straight Projecter is pretty cool on battery power about 25 hours plugged in watch forever JBL speakers are cool 10 battery life again plugged in forever All in all the motto z is a cool phone with all the modsReally like it works great phone calls are clear battery lasts more than all day So just have the speaker mode looking forward to the next new modes in the near futureBought two of the Moto Z Droid is mostly what I need but wish had bought the Moto Z Force The worst thing that they need are better and more selection of cases etcLet me tell you I have a moto z that I liked a couple months back when I got it That is no longer the case and wish I had never gotten a moto phone This phone is now locking up What do I mean It freezes The screen will stay black even with the phone on And if it does light up its covered in these weird colored streaked lines that cover the whole screen Its like this right now It might come back and work for a little while correctly like it has before when it done this but who knows and if it does for how long This truly is the WORST phone I have ever had in my life It is nothing but a expensive paper weight to me nowReally like the phoneI was hoping for more advanced features at this point in the game but it is a good replacement for my droid maxx which I was used to  Very similar but I wish they would have kept the same messaging systemI went to the Verizon store to get a new Samsung but the salesperson said that they did not carry many Samsung phones because of the recent bad publicity I said that I just wanted a phone Then the salesperson said that the Moto was superior to the Samsung I think the Moto is competitive but not superior For example if you want to make a long telephone call you cannot use your earphones because they use the same port USB C as the charger cable Also you cannot use earphones without an adapter cable I still have figured out how to save pictures and music Must I buy another cable The charger is one piece I cannot disconnect the plug and attach the cable to my laptop The Moto is not a cell phone It is a portable computer with telephone capabilities I go through more steps before I can actually key in a telephone number than with the Samsung Motorola must be providing rebates to Verizon that Samsung does not provideBut this phone 4 days ago awful battery life love every feature about the phone except for thatIve had this phone for a little over a week now with no issues My only thing I dislike about it is that it doesnt have a headphone jack and has to have an adaptor for it in the charging port Its kind of annoying Other than that I love the camera it takes amazing quality picturesVery cyberpunk with the mods on it but that being said these are not the selling point of the phone It is good without them but they do add to its versatility and overall life thanks to each mod having its own chargeable battery I love the picture weight and size of this phone as it fits me and I am not one to carry a portable tablet as many people are prone to do nowadaysthis phone is easy to use and has a great cameraIve had phones since the days of bag phones and all I can say about the Moto is just DONT I experienced 5 days of pure frustration until I could get to Verizon to exchange for the iPhone 6s Phone wouldnt activate out of the box refused to allow access to the cloud attempted for 4 days straight to install a Moto upgrade 29 hours to download notice and it never did  refused to recognize any wireless and would churn and churn and churn attempting the simplest applications After 7 total hours on the phone with tech support I gave up Battery life never lasted longer than 3 hours and I would literally watch the percentage drain before my eyes with limited to no use Worst piece of garbage ever invented plus it would get HOT within minutes of use With so many other options available find one Epic fail Droidvery happy with this phone works great ezelent featuresCannot hear ring or notification  Sound very very lowLove itW Orks great Much faster than my old moto xChanged from iPhone to moto z because I liked the option of being able to use a micro SD card to increase my storage capability  Yes the learning curve was amazing  Still learning after 2 weeks  Over all the phone is great  Its fast and intuitive  Waiting for an update that will fix a notification alert volume issue Not sorry I have this phoneThe moto Z provides you with the thinnest form factor while still providing great battery life and performance  I love the form factor with the moto mods that give you the option of creating a phone that is truly unique and one of a kind  Great phoneVery good service would recommendI changed a couple of weeks ago Doing alright Few changesI have this phone for about two weeks Have always liked the Motorola droid phones since they have the best battery life that Ive ever seen I can go 23 days without charging And the Moto mods are super cool I have the JBL speaker mod and it is great Love that the glass is shatterproof tooHad for a week good features nice size ExpandableI bought this phone a few weeks ago and this phone is awesomeLike the phone not the price but so far its better that the LG4 I hadit was a piece of dungBought two a few days ago and very happy  There are some drawbacks such as the phone being so large you cannot use it with one hand Also no headphone jack Another thing the USB port is different from other Android phones  Its such an awesome phone we can overcome these challengesI transitioned from an iphone and fine this phone much easier to operateVery thin and light weightIve had it a couple weeks Battery drains quickly and touch screen is intermittent Not 100 happyAnd a great dealthanksphone is really big and will not git in a standard jean pocket no headphone jack so you have to purchase wireless headphones to listen to music not user friendly especially when trying to operate the phone with one handlove my phone never lags and the battery power is great no complaints so glad I made the switchThe Moto Z Droid is a fabulous phone and it rocks on Verizons service  Im impressed with the speed of the network  Im getting up to 65 Mbps download speeds on this phone  Wow

The phone is very responsive and fast in everything it does ie loading apps webpages etc  It seems that apps just snap to the forefront when loading  I dont see the lag Ive gotten in the past

Battery life  That was my concern because the Moto Z has so much less battery life than its brethren the Moto Z Force and Moto Z Play  At 2600 mahr  it is lasting me the whole day most every day  I keep the quick charger in my office on my desk  I rarely have used it to top off and tend to have at least 60 remaining at the end of my work day  I have been using the phone more than I ordinarily might because its new and Ive been taking time to set it up the way I like it

I also bought a couple of battery mods so if its every an issue because I have to drop everything and run I have the Incipio slim 2200 mah battery mod and the bigger 3000 mah Mod from Mophie  With that on hand anyone should be able to get through a whole day with the heaviest use

The phone looks good and my son loves the thinness  He marveled at how much thinner it is than his Apple 7 plus  I bought my wife one the same day and her workmates are remarking how classy the device looks  Hers is wrapped in the Kate Spade case for protection but it really looks great on the phone

I hope this helps those of you trying to make a decision  I really like the phone a lot  Its as close to plain android as you can get without going to the Google Pixel or a Nexus  Matter of fact I received the latest update to Android 7  Noughat within days of purchase  I recevied Android 7 before the Nexus phones received theres from Google  AmazingGreat phone easy to useI used to have a Samsung 6 but now have the Moto and it was an easy transition However one thing I do not like is that it is necessary to have an adapter to plug in headphones as there is no headphone jackSince I started buying smartphones I have always bought Motorola Androids Theyre the best phones in my opinion and the Moto Z is definitely the best one so farI am pretty sure mine has a glitch the speaker takes awhile to send sound out 1 in 5 calls I cant hear unless they call When I am watching a video I have to go into settings to turn the volume down The volume down button on the side just turns my phone volume down not the video volumeGreat phone good features great feel and size  Not flimsy and very responsive  Google Now is driving me crazy  It responds to external voices like during the National Anthem at ballgame conversation with my wife etc  Then when you want it to work it will not respondNow that Ive used the Motorola PreLock Screen I dont know that I could go back to another phone Its so much faster to play and pause my music or to quickly read my messages

Being able to quickly turn on my flashlight or camera by merely moving the device has proven immensely useful again Im not sure how I could go back to another phone without this ease of access

I got the JBL Speaker mod it sounds great gets mega loud and sweetens the pot that much more On top of that its really snappy and the only non pixel group of phones to support Google Daydream as of writing 12062016I like it but the Bluetooth and wifi isnt too great they always cut out and Bluetooth never connectsGot 2 weeks ago Only issue is with trying to get Skype to workBattery is only lasting 8 to 10 hours on a full charge with low to moderate use No apps are left running Location ext is off so I dont know why Also blue tooth does not go into discovery modeLove the volume the large font and the great graphics on videos and moviesglad I have this phoneI like this device  except that it consumes quite a bit of battery rather fast  Mods are niceI switched to Motorola with my last smartphone purchase and havent looked back As a small business owner I need battery life durability and function which Motorola excels at The Moto Z is no different I love the available mods and am looking forward to using the charger and speaker for extended battery life on the go and conference calls in the office The Social Digest is a nice touch on this phone it corrals all of your social media notifications into one place The fast charger is fantasticIts a bit big for methe volume could be louderAwesome my old phone was starting to bomb out  every week and this one has gret memory and the battery life is excellentIm mostly satisfied but there are a few issues that greatly disappoint me

They couldnt transfer my data as in previous versions so I must do it all step by step
  
My previous phone would allow me to chose to view only contacts with a phone  listed in my google accounts  Without that option I have a plethora of contacts with only email addresses that makes my contact list abominably long  annoying to use  I also have an intense dislike for all phone numbers addresses and notes that Ive entered on a contact not showing up without hitting show all  That can still be forgotten and the wrong number dialed because one believes its the only one there

Every previous Droid could be plugged into my computer which allowed me to add photos or excel files easily to be accessed on the phone  This phone will not show the folders or their structure  Their method of adding photos pulls random photos from my hard drive with no apparent rhyme or reason  I have tens of thousands of photos organized my wifes and my family all the way back to the 1800s on the computer but without the tree I cant find the dozen that I desire to keep with me  

I despise not being able to load the old My Verizon Shared Data gaugemeter which I use regularly  This may be a Verizon issue rather than a phone issue

The battery life bright screen and fast recharging are great pluses from all my past phones  I would like to be able to place more icons ie five across in a row on the screens and I also hate the home screen being on the left screen instead of the center screen  All the apps one normally uses can fit on three screens  If the home page is centered one only needs to move one screen left or right depending on the type of app being sought  This makes one retrain his muscle memory as well as having to concentrate more every time one looks for somethingJust received phone works greatDont  like it as much as my droid maxthis phone is great accept for the battery  i wish moto used the largermoto z play droid for the moto z droidI ordered this phone online had a little issue getting it connected but after it was connected it has been very similar operation to my droid turbo I love the mods the battery mod is so helpful it charges the phone quickly and doesnt need to stay connected it transfers power to the phone and then can be removed allowing you to reinstall a different modMy new phone is very glitchy  Picture quality is no where near what I was told it would be  Thought I would be soo happy but my droid Maxx is a better phone than thisJust bought this phone and truly happy to be back Love my phoneIve had this phone a few weeks and the battery is great I like it better than my SamsungGreat phone and networkThis phone is horrible and annoying It does not perform any of the functions that my Samsung phones did I am terribly dissapointedNot really that happy with my new phone not very simple to use  as my last phone my and this will be my LAST phone on Verizon since I had so many problems when buying it all the new tec is not for me I made a big mistake buying a new phoneStill trying to get used to this new phone 1st smart phone Only have had for 1 weekOver all the phone is great I dont like the text messaging program I dont particularly care for the way you have to delete call history I really dont appreciate having 34 program upgrades I understand these phones sit on a shelf until they are sold and program updates are needed as improvements are made after the phone is ready for market What would be nice is to have them done all at 1 timeIt seems to be a good phonedo miss some of the features of my LG phonebut am getting used to and enjoying the Moto ZIm happy w my buy  I had a G3 and this is a great upgrade  Only complaints is the keyboard and camera selfies featurenoneI got this on recommendation by Verizon guy I wish I got the phone I went in for I have 7 days left to either suck it up and keep it or get something else and dinged for whatever it costs to get something else

The battery life is horrific and I am not a heavy cell phone user by any standard its mostly on standby some texting photo taking use wifi or data about 30 minutes daily  That being said the battery will decline 3040 within 12 hours  My HTC with the same size battery could hold a decent charge for 4 days with the same amount of use  I dont understand

I do like the motion sensor its very bright and Motorola has some nice features that Samsung and HTC do not Im still learning the phone
I dont care about how thin it is Id much rather have a bigger battery  Dont even try to sell me the battery mod eitherGreat but battery doesnt perform as well as what the specs saidSooooo much better than my 4G LG I replaced Love the picture quality wish I could view the results of a picture on the same page as taken without having to exit go to photos and back again to attempt a better photoI had trouble answering from the lock screen at first  I miss the GPS tracker that was in my old phoneEarly Christmas present to myself so happy I got it Wonderful phoneI just got my phone this week  And I love it Easy to setup and use  After all the updates everything works great I would recommend this phone to anyoneHas a great camera and most features are the same as my S4Easy to use very clear pictures and video loud speaker quality and battery life is great Love itI bought this phone two weeks ago and Im falling in love with it Its faster and lighter than my old phoneI bought 4 of these for Christmas gifts  I gave one to my mother in law  the phone is constantly rebooting  now I have to go and return it  not a happy customer Possibly going to return the other 3 as well  According to the Internet  this is an issueGreat battery life Great photosI am a long time DroidMotorola user  I love the slim sleek feel of this Moto X but when they say 24 hour battery they exaggerated  Thankfully the phone charges quickly 

Apps install and run well and I especially like the built in Moto apps Good phone call audio and network connections Ive had the phone a week with no dropped callsThis phone offers the level of security I require for work Its slim light and beautiful As powerful as newest phonesVery Happy overallLike most everything about the phone Only negatives  are battery life battery built into and if you use any add ons you cant use a caseI finally cracked the screen on my aging Razr Maxx and had to replace it This new Moto Z Droid a has a bigger screen b runs much faster c charges very quickly
But on the downside a it lacks a separate notification LED to inform you of missed calls incoming messages etc b does not have a headphone jack although an adapter cable is provided but is a bit clumsy c is so thin that I fear that I will soon crack this even larger screenlike the little bigger screen and thinner  profileIf you are tired of Apple  Samsung and need a change this is it 4GB ram snapdragon 820 Expandable memory and a very good camera The Moto Mods are a bonus and really set this phone apart from the restI thought Id cry if I didnt get the phone But I was so happy when I bought itBought this to replace my old phone with insufficient memory and poor camera performance  This is a wonderful upgradeIve had this phone for about 2 weeks and the reception is horrible I have been a customer of Verizons for several years and never had problems with reception however this phone doesnt work in my homeI tried to make the Moto Z work for me but I miss my SamsungSide buttons are small no indicator light for incoming messages and the phone is a bit longer than I wanted The features that do come with it is great thoughExcellent sound Calls are incredibly clear Great camera Easy to use The battery life is good but was hoping of a more dramatic improvement from my previous phone The good news is the turbo battery charge is very fastIm so very glad I bought this new phone I love the fingerprint sensor to unlock itReally nice phone runs really smoothly and everything is set up really nice too Its super convenient features such as the touch pad that can turn my screen on or off helps out a lot tooWas really a tough choice what I found that I like most about it is the mods even though they seem to be on a bit of the expensive side just love the idea of many toolsGenerally happy with the Moto z Just realized that power cord does not have USB end on it that would allow direct hook up to my computer Every other phone Ive had offered this featureI bought this phone and would of liked a manual to go through all of the apps and set ups Each phone is differentGreat phone other than I never noticed it doesnt have a headphone jackI am still learning about it but enjoying it so farHad problems with Verizon Cellular Sales not wanting to give me a new phone that they had in the store because they already ordered one so I was inconvenienced for a few daysMy new Moto Z Droid is so easy to use After everything was transferred I started using it I reccomend getting the protective cover for it It feels like its not even there besides you can never be too sureI needed a new phonesince only owning for a little over a week it is hard to fully review but as of now it seems to be feature rich  thin and was very easy to begin using it has prompts to help you with the set up of each item So far very pleasedWay too much interaction to make the answer feature work smoothly Way too many graphics get in the way Other than that I like the other features The camera on the phone is very goodStill learning this phone  Unfortunately no classes at my Verizon store until January  Also am unable to synch the Bluetooth on my car  not happy about thathad for it a close to 2 weeks clear sound no problems so farI bought this phone about 10 days ago and I am very happy with itDoes a lot of things but none well  Too many limitations on file saving and other functions to sell band width  Marketing overwhelms customer satisfactionThis phone has the best sound quality of any Ive owned Although there is no message indicator light I love the fact I can just wave my hand over the screen to check for notificationsSo happy to switch phone  carrierLike the phone but accessories are not easy to findI bought this phone last week and I am loving it The phone is very flexible and easy to model to your preferences and the Moto gear function is just phenomenal The Moto camera takes some of the best pictures Ive ever had For the first time I was also able to change the Google maps guidance voice to Australian accent No other phone Ive had let me do that and I change phones once a yearIve had this phone barely a week and have been tempted to return it I hate the poo looking emojis plus they never stay attached to my texts after I hit send if i add them while writing The keyboard doesnt have the punctuation in the same screen as the letters so to punctuate I have to move from one screen to another Then a bit ago I tried editing the writing in a text and the delete kept hoping to the end of the text rather than the first word where I kept putting the curser There quite a few strange quirks like that these are the reason for the low rating Really The emojis look like a pile of Dodogreat phone too short too badGreat quality and features Id definitely by another Moto in the futureNice Phone graphics are amazingUp graded from flipphone WOWI upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone Ive had for more than 2 years I was afraid to get another Samsung since the rumors right now are that theyre blowing up So the sales guy recommended the Moto Z Droid I had seen the commercials and dont plan on using any of the attachments ever  
I really miss having the notification light I REALLY hate that there isnt a home button and the fingerprint scanner is the only button on the screen of the phone so its a major waste if you dont use the fingerprint And you cant just use the fingerprint you have to use that AND a password or pin or pattern I dont like that I cant create folders in the apps storage to more easily hide the ones I dont frequently use Lastly and Im not sure this is the phone or the user the sales guy but the way my contacts transferred over is ridiculous I have 9 of the same person and three of this other person it saved only this persons work phone number I only had 67 contacts to transfer but that number more than tripled with a lot of the same contacts  That has really ticked me off  
On the plus side the phone is very fast the screen is bigger it was easy to purchase accessories online I like how quickly it charges I like how long it can stay alive the quick functions like flicking the phone a certain way turns on the camera or flashlight are very convenient The camera is better than my old phone and there is a flash for the front camera too Overall any new phone was going to be an upgrade from my 2 year old phoneI bought it 2 weeks ago and was a little iffy about it because we are not droid fans period but this droid just brought us back Love everything about it so farvery easy to use and get use toI bought a Moto Z Droid about a week ago and immediately experienced problems connecting to the Internet over wifi There was a problem with the hardware of the phone Today I was able to return to the authorized retailer who exchanged the defective Moto Z with a new one I am happy to report on the great features amazing camera and wifi contability of my new Moto Z I am absolutely in love with this phone as well as its ability for modsI love this phone its so much better than the other phone I hadEnjoy the new features  easy to useIts does seem pretty fast there isnt a bunch of preloaded junk on it Thats a big plus the bad news the battery life leaves much to be desired Alittle bit smaller than my Nexus 6 but thats okay but my battery life was still better All and all great phone though nice geek tricks youll still like itI wont buy this poor excuse for a cell phone Another chunk of green for a projector and another chunk of green for a snapon battery ect Does this thing come with a holster to carry all this junk What a terribly poor designThe agent suggested this but I am not sold on it  Only keeping it because of restock fee  If you dont mind vibrating when touching buttons or a smaller screen this is a great phoneGreat service and the Moto z I got I love itI purchased this phone because the phone that I had for about 5 yrs was dying This phone has some wonderful features Im still learning how to work everything The size and weight were the main reason for the MOTO being my new phone So far Im liking this phoneI really like the phones capabilities and attachments that goes with itIve Had this phone For 2 weeks nice phone easy to operate  Had the Droid razor Before defitnley a nice upgradeThis is my first smartphone and although the first couple of days were a challenge within a few days Im able to use it fairly well   It has some nice features like voice commands  Im sure Ill learn something new about it each dayweekI purchased the phone a week ago  One issue that I have so far is that the volume level ismuch lower than my Motorola Droid RAZR M  Also I use my phone as a mobile credit card reader  There is no port to plug in a card readerHad my Moto Z Droid a bit over a month Completely satisfied All the Moto Mods are also an added luxury I recommend this phone to everyone it is so much easier to use than an Iphone with most of the same optionsIts only been two weeks but Im hookedBought Moto Zs with battery mod for my wife and myself Performance and battery lif are absolutely wonderfulThe battery drains fastThis phone overall it nice biggest disappointment is the battery life Before buying I read reviews overall great reviews about phone So both my husband and myself bought this phone He is a truck driver so he need his phone to last he got the force The biggest well only complaint is battery lofe Seems like the phone battery last most the day as long as you dont use the phone at all Maybe we were spoiled by our Samsung notes but I typically have to charge Moto at least 2 times to make it though the day sometimes more I do use my phone but no more than I used my Samsung which I usually only charge at night and was fine for the day I lower the brightness and turn off location no Bluetooth and still dies quickly I also make sure there is no apps running in the back round  Positive is charger does charge fast but if you are not in a area you can plug your out of luck The phone is thin and has options to add speaker projector camera and ext battery all sold separately and are pricey Other then the battery I do like this phone it has a good camera and lost of optionsI just bought it last week and I am still adjusting I used to be able to control sounds and notifications for each app by going to settings This is driving me crazy trying to figure it out I dont like the constant notifications from Facebook and emails but need to know when someone is texting me Turning the volume down is not an optionProven brand and reliabilityIts pretty easy to use but it gets hot fairly quickly Some kind of an actual guide with it wouldnt be a terrible idea And itd be nice to get this predictive index banner off the top of the keyboardI am still learning all of the features of my new phone It has all of the features I loved in my previous Droid as well as so many added bonusesGreat screen and camera easy to useI bought this phone a little over a week ago The salesperson said it was a great phone Well it is not I was told the battery was very good Well it is not I cannot make it to lunch without recharging The charger is different so I cant use my old chargers from my other android phones Now I have to bring my charger with me everywhereIve had my new Moto for 3 weeks and Im in love Ive had Samsung phones for 5 years and had no idea how much better Moto had made the Android experienceI have had Samsung phones since the S2  I went to the S3 S4 then to Note 3 Note 4 and Note 5  I have loved every single one of them  I wanted the Note 7 but you know that story  I was looking at the G S7 Edge when my friend told me about the Moto Z  He went with me to look at it and I decided I had to give this phone a try  He has Mods you can get with it so I got the extended batterywireless charger the projector and the add on camera that has a telescoping lense  They all are very cool and work really well  I cant recommend this phone enoughHad to give up my Samsung bc it was a fire hazard this phone is terrible touch screen is horrible mic talk to txt never wants to work battery is useless and never pulls any wifiThe Z Droid doesnt have many of the features Id come to love with my Turbo The battery was supposed to last longer it doesnt and there is always static in the ear when I am on the phone Ive had it less than 2 wks and I have already had to do a factory resetStill learning how to use my phone as there were not a lot of directionjust love the phone and it featuresEvery time the phone moves the time pops up  No way to shut it down so the battery life sucks The stock apps are far inferior to those on the Samsungshave had this phone for 15 days and love it alreadyVery user friendly and great qualityI bought it a week ago not really happyThis is an excellent phone and is a very easy transition from the iPhone I had previously Go into the Verizon store and play with all of the phones there Only a few stand out and that includes this Moto Z This phone is extremely well built and it just works The battery life and signal reception are excellent If you live in an area without a great signal like I do then you need this phone The reception is much better than the iPhone The phone is not loaded with a ton of extra software and it all works flawlessly I checked out the newest iPhone and it just feels like a toy compared to this phone I would recommend the Moto Z to anyone looking for a great affordable smartphoneI bought this phone for my wife  It took her a few days to get used to it but now she absolutely loves itThis phone does not have good battery life  I find some apps are glitchy  The speaker on phone calls is tinny sounding  The finger print feature is good  The response time is very good but as I mentioned can be glitchy at times  My worst complaint is the battery life  I do not like that you can not use a cover to protect the whole phone if you use the back cover I havent used any Moto ModsI bought this less than a month ago but  it so farI am not loyal to Android or Apple phones but having said that I came from an iPhone 6s I purchased this through my local Verizon store so I was able to have a hands on experience The manager of the store had the projection moto mod and I thought that was a very cool feature I was looking to go back to the Android OS again and Samsung didnt appeal to me at the moment thank goodness after the NOTE battery fires Having this phone since its release I can say I have a lovehate relationship with it The internal battery is terrible so I had to purchase the battery mod without the external battery this phone would be useless It doesnt make the phone much thicker though but I find it a necessity The camera is nice when you have full light to take pictures in BUT low light pictures are some of the worse I have seen on a phone as of late My older 6s blew this camera out of the water Some apps I use work most of the time but I find this phone to be buggy I dont know why some apps work and some do not but it can be a pain in the rear There are times someone will send me a text message and the phone never notifies me This happens with FULL cellular signal and 4GLTE I have reset the phone turned it off and back on and nothing fixes that problem The volume is also terrible and when turned up to its max is still to low to hear especially in a busy environment The fingerprint scanner is a very nice feature that I use for almost everything The screen resolution is also nice and I have no complaints there I would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants a stable phone I  think I got hooked on the moto mods to which I only have the battery mod pack and didnt get as OCD which I normally do I dont think I will have this phone very longThis phone is wafer thin and does it all Screen is bright and big Fingerprint scanner is excellent Battery lasts all day Best phone I ever hadSwitched back to Android from Windows because of the disappearing apps I chose this phone because I didnt want an iPhone wannabe  I love the motion features like turning on the flashlight and camera Camera could be better but I guess most cameras wont compare to my old Lumia icons features and lenses But so far feels solid and smoothOnly had phone for 2 weeks but its by far the best Ive ever ownedThis issuch a great phonebought it a couple weeks ago not the phone I wanted wanted the Samsung note 5 was not available for the price I could afford It will have to do for now
Ive had it for 8 days and been back to the store twice with issues A new issue popped up today I couldnt get a mobile deposit accepted by my credit union Still trying Dont know if its the photos which dont look very clear to me or what yet Also the battery isnt any longer lasting than the one I just turned in Another issue which is overrideable is it doesnt recognize Google only Google ChromeIve only had the phone a week In that week there have been 2 ota updates that have ultimately ruined the speaker performance on the phone The notifications are so quiet that you cant hear them unless youre in a really quiet placeI had the Samsung Note7 in my hands the first day it came out and something just told me to wait a few weeks because I expected defects The Verizon man also told me to wait and maybe consider a previous Note like the 4 which still had a removable battery We both had no idea that a defect this serious would have happen with Samsung phones With that said I went back to motorola because prior to my S3 I had a droidx  Ive had this phone for 3 weeks now Its everything I need Its fully functional super fast and I was instantly sold on Moto mod capable My only issue is the home screen button is part of screen and while texting I often hit it instead of the space bar Other than that the speaker could be louder but its loud enough to wake me up in the morning and be heard downstairs while ringing Overall its a great Phone  dont be afraid to leave Apple and Samsung for itI had a Moto Droid Turbo and liked the phone with the textured holster and kick stand  This Z wont fit a holster due to the extra Tumi battery pack is too thick  The phone is so slippery I constantly almost drop it  On top of that the screen is right to the edge so your fingers while gripping just the sides trigger screen actions  

I am really unhappy with this phone  It is a work tool not a fashion statement to mebought the Moto Z Droid a month ago  I am getting use to the Android OS needs better and easier hands free talking  I like the mods that you can add to the phone  the speaker blew away my friends and the image is sharpI bought this phone last week when i was on vacation I get on the plane to come home only to find out that the phone does not have any phone jacks I was upset and had to fly all the way back to texas with no music Then i tried to charge my phone only to find out that the phone did not have the regular charging port so my phone died if youre looking for the add on gadgets for the phone they are very expensiveother than that it is a good phone with alot of powerMy phone broke so I had to upgrade Hate to spend so much money on a phone Phones are ridiculously expensive Phone working great so farI originally planned to upgrade to another phone but the Verizon wireless associate showed me the Droid Motto and I was sold I like the slim profile and the lightness Since its an Android phone it was easy for me to use since my old phone was also an AndroidI bought the phone about a week ago and its awesomeI have always been a droid guy and I just upgraded from a Droid Maxx to the Moto Z I really liked my Droid Maxx and so far I have only had it about 2 weeks but I really like the Moto Z The big kicker though now which kinda stinks  wise but technology has changed to make charging better is with the newer Droids is you will be buying all new acessories so add another 6090 to your upfront costs especially chargers as they charge your phone extremely faster which I love but they use a different connector now But I love the phone so far the battery does drain quicker than my Maxx did but I can still get a good 24hrs on a charge with light data use and maybe turning the Battery Saver on so its not too bad Plus you can charge your phone in about 15min now compared to my old Maxx which could take 45 hours to completely chargeI got this phone because I broke my 2 year old Droid Turbo and couldnt get a replacement  Heres my procon list
PRO
light and thin
Good display
like the fingerprint lock
Like the magnet back innovation and potential accessories

CONS
Only ok audio I like my phone to be a good PHONE first and foremost
no earbud jack
mediocre battery life
less good camera than the Turbo for lighting and correct color without color adjustment options either
new charger plug means I need to buy all new chargers
NONE OF THE CHARGERS HAVE USB ENDS meaning you have to buy ANOTHER cable beyond the factory charger it comes with in order to synch with your computer
apps menu is now scroll instead of leftright swipe meaning you have to look down to get an app like Maps or Waze instead of swipe swipe tap because you know where your apps are  Lazy design work
Less intuitive layoutusage  Trying to upload ringtones thanks to poor layout and also lack of USB charging cable took far too long  I wound up downloading new ones from a website

In short its trying to be an Apple phone instead of the next fabulous iteration of a Droid  Droid we love you  because you ARENT Apple  Stick with what you know and get rid of the four steps to do things where there used to be only one stepOne thing I think that Verizon and Google play could do is if you wanted to get an app but wanted to see what its like instead of having to download the whole app make it so you can download a trial of the app and if they want to keep playing they can download the app off the Google play store but thats just my opinionI cant connect to my car blue tooth  with my phone for receiving phone calls  The only way someone I can hear anyone is if I put my phone on speaker which is dangerous when drivingI bought this last weekend I like it except for when Im on the phone and have it on speaker   
Everyone tells me that they can hardly hear me I go in and out and sound like Im in a tunnel What can I do about thisIts been good so farI love this phone and the length of the charge and how quickly it rechargesBattery that comes with the phone leases a little to be desired  It seems to improve a little with use and keeping the apps turn off  Changing the location of the onoff and volume buttons on the side takes some getting use toBasically the same as the LG G3 I traded for it it looks better is faster but user customizations wont work for ringtones if you create your own edits Home charger is hardwired so no pulling the USB3 wire for optional connection or PC interface
This phone feels like Motorola is just dusting itself but still needs direction Get a clueAwesome phone But the speaker is a little weakGood phone easy to usePhone screen cracked the second day I had itnot even a week later and the screen stopped working as I took the speaker attachment off the phone I planned to return before cracking my screen because I didnt like the camera My pictures were very grainyIm two months into my Moto Z and as a life long Motorola owner always on big red I can say that this is the best and most innovative phone Ive ever had Its fast Really fast Like scary fast Upgradable memory beautiful all day battery and stunningly thin and fast camera The Moto suite of actions just makes this thing all the sweeter Oh did I mention its modular Any time you want a battery bigger speaker or screen its a click away Best idea everLove this phone switched from a Droid Turbo My favorite phone so farSwitched from the Droid Mini to this phone Took some getting used to just due to size difference but I like this one now Definitely has some cooler features built in eg Flashlight as opposed to having to download apps for it Really hard to find cases for it other than ordering online and no cases exist that will allow you to have any of the mods attached to the phone which is a HUGE fail on the part of every company making cases for this phone I havent had a chance to test out all the features like moto gestures and have yet to spend any money on the moto mods as they can be pricey the projector is half the price of the phone but overall its a good phoneI got this phone about a month ago and it is easy to use great camera and fantastic battery lifeI dont know how to transfer from my old phone to this one I dont like the charger that it takes a usbc I dont care for the volume I have it up as high as it will go and sometimes still cant hear itMy Moto Z is by far the best Ive gotten  Last year I upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S4 to the iPhone 6 and discovered that I preferred the setup of the Samsung  So I reverted to the S4 and was reminded of the poor reception from an apparently inferior antenna system in the Samsungabsolutely no service in my building at work where I had somewhat better reception with the iPhone  Well I walked my new Moto into the building yesterday and maintained a 4G and 3G signal  Im very happy  I like the slightly larger size and functions that to me are superior to the iPhone  Ive had every type of cell phone since 1991 brick flip phone blackberry earlier Motorola Razor you name it and Ive discovered the best yet in the Moto ZLove quick charge  Very user friendly and functional  Im hooked on Moto Z  Im a senior and fairly tech savvy but this phone is so easy to set up and use would recommend it for anyoneThis phone is very basic for what youre paying I switched from my Droid Turbo to this phone only because my Turbo shattered and I returned it after a week or so The operating system is the Marshmallow which is not anything to get excited about The camera is subpar the battery doesnt last for 8 hours and the phone was very glitchy I was not impressed at all especially with the design of the phone Its very thin so thin the phone doesnt come with an aux output Instead you have to use this adaptor cable for headphones which was very annoying Maybe Im the only person who is constantly listening to music on my phone but I was very annoyed with this missing feature The Mods feature doesnt work the way youd think The backs come off the phone rather easily even the basic cover that comes with the phoneLove my new phone works greatthis phone runs so much smother than my last oneIt was very easy to move my apps and information from my old phone to the new phone  I am enjoying the clarity of the photographs the new phone takes as well as taking advantage of the finger print security  The Moto Z has a lot of great features and Ive only just begun to delve into themI like the mods and ease of useI got the moto Z two weeks ago its fantastic easy to learn the new features and supper fast I bought the battery mod and its great I can go three full days without needing to recharge overall above expectationsNot overly expensive great display smooth UI easy to use great onehand features antenna strength could be improved Love the ModsThe phone is great much like a Samsung But the accessories make it The battery pack moto mod is awesome I cant wait to try the other modsI purchased a motor droid a month ago  all I can say is WONDERFUL phonei had this phone for about a week and have dropped it a few time and never cracked the screenLove this phone its greatIts got great security nifty motion features and you can talk to it and ask it questions The camera is decent tooIve had the device for just over a week now and Im very happy with it The phone looks great and is very easy to hold it is quite a tall phone but narrow and that makes it work well for onehand use The fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast and accurate  Ive never seen any phone work as well as the Moto Z Droid Many reviewers seem to be surprised that the phone doesnt have a 35mm headphone jack which presumably means that they didnt look at the phone before buying it It does come with a usbc to 35mm adapter but because I primarily use bluetooth headphones I havent taken it out of the box yet I think removing such an archaic analog port is the right thing to do but for audiophiles using traditional headphones this may well be a bigger deal for you than it is for me 

I had two concerns when I bought the phone  the camera and battery life The camera  has produced some great photos with three elements Im interested in  focus detail and vibrancy I would agree that it isnt quite as intuitive to use as some other flagships  particularly in low light but given a little time to figure out all of the options in the camera my concern is laid to rest For battery life the question was whether the phone could make it through the day without relying on the battery moto mod as a default The answer for me is yes provided it is a typical day eg downloading and installing the latest security updates does not qualify as typical The Mod provides peace of mind though and means that I dont have to change my usage because if in doubt the mod is there and it replenishes the battery very quickly 

Although much of the media attention for this device has been about the mods or about the lack of the headphone jack where the phone really shines is in terms of software If youve used a Moto X in the past you already know that the software creates an experience that in my view is unmatched The always on display just wave your hand over the phone chop chop for the flashlight double twist for the camera texts read to you when you are driving custom launch phrase screen that stays on when it knows you are reading etc All of this over an otherwise vanilla Android that just flies without a stutter or lag 

The Moto mods are a great concept with really smart engineering to make them work so seamlessly Personally I dont think you should buy the phone just for the mods  they are icing on the cake for an amazing phone 

Im very happy with the Moto Z Droid and would happily recommend it to others This is the Droid I was looking forI bought this phone last thursday and im happy with everything so far The sales rep took his time helping me understand and learn most of what my new phone could do and how some of the new accessories worked Ive been a Verizon customer for 8 years i love some of the moto mods the phone has the extra battery life and the screen is clear and sharpI have it two weeksOverall its a great phone the only draw back is the lack of an earphone port One needs to use a converter in the USBC portjust one more thing to loseEasy to get used to since it is the Android platform Easy to figure out how to personalize Only downfall is getting out of a game by getting the navigation buttons up is sometimes tricky But Im sure it will get easier with timeSlim even when you add on the battery pack mod Loving the wood grain back And this thing does not lag I have only had one problem and its rare which is the Bluetooth not connecting Otherwise this phone is better than the iPhone 7 Finally something different Btw the magnets just workIt is always static in phone calls and the screen is not clear at allI bought this phone a few weeks and Im glad I didStill trying to figure things out  No directions manualthe speaker is low and in fron stacticHappy with my phone Wouldnt have anything but a Motorola phoneVery fast great screen great battery Moto speaker is fabulous but heavystill trying to figure some things out great phoneIts a little bigger than I expected but so far far exceeds my expectationsGood phone Like it a lot I dont like that you cant get the volume out of it like my old phone but it is closegreat phone dont think the hotspot picks up as good as the old moto xbut overall happy with the productI have read review after review and have always had an affinity for Motorola products  When I knew I was coming up on upgrade eligibility hands downs I knew I wanted the latest and greatest and this was itDont like the phoneIt was time to retire my old Droid so I went with the new Moto Z I love the phone and all of the great functionality but it is just too large for my taste I am going to keep the phone because it suits my needs very well and there just arent very many small phones out there The slim design helps with the size a little bit Im a guy and I would normally keep the phone in my front pants pocket Seriously I think this phone would be just perfect if the screen was about twothirds the size We will see how it holds up over timeI bought this phone a week ago and Im very unhappy with it The battery drains when the phone is shut off I loose people all the time or they conversation is cut up So you cant understand themBought this phone a week ago and I love itBought it about 2 weeks ago everything working wellI have loved both Droid phones I have ownedHappy I bought the phone Still learning to use featuresBought this on labor day 2016  Like it alot  Best phone that I have had in 10 yearsIm very happy with the Moto Z Marshmallow is much better than KitKat I had a Droid Maxx before and this is the first flagship phone Ive had and I made a good choice Thanks VerizonGreat phone  Just bummed that there is no headset jack  I know thats the direction some phones are going but I dont agree with it  Other than that no other complaints at allIve had a good bit of time to test this out now  I use a tech21 case and have not played around with the mods yet The phone is awesome and people are blown away by the video and photo quality Even tho it is not as good as the force in megapixels it still excels as a daily shooter for me I have dropped it face down on pavement twice without a scratch perhaps thanks to the tech21 and the screen protector For me the shatterproof would have been a nice addition but I prefer the slimness of this phone It is ideal It is so easy to use with one hand or two and has many accessibility options On my old phone turbo my hand would press the screen when I tried to reach all the way to the top corners This one I can use and it does not detect any false presses The battery is adequate but makes me feel a bit like an iPhone user being more tethered to the wall I love everything about it ignore the haters because they have unrealistic expectations Phone is a beast and is pure qualityGreat phone
It is very fast and easy to useI have had this phone 1 month and it has locked up and I have had to pull the SIM card to reset it  Now it is overheating not powering up and buzzing if sim card is in  They better give me a new phone tomorrow when I go to Verizon storeI want a power pack pod for it and the one that turns the camera phone into one with a zoom lensThe phone functions just fine but its so thin and the surfaces are so slick I always feel like Im about to drop the phone If Id spent more time holding it in my hand I probably would not have bought this phoneI replaced my previous droid moto with the moto Z The phone is nice overall I like the fingerprint pad and it works well Its much easier than entering in a PIN I like the USBC plug even though I had to replace all my charge cords Also the thinness of the phone comes at a price Battery life with the internal battery is not good But my biggest complaint is that this phone is buggy several of my apps  that worked perfectly with the previous moto routinely crash on the moto ZIm oldfashioned enough that I use my phone for calling and this phone is a huge step up from the Droid Turbo it replaced in terms of call quality so a big plus for that  On the flip side the Turbo battery life spoiled me and this phone is not nearly as longlived  a tradeoff from the slim size I suppose  Manage your apps and your screen options carefully and youll be fine  App installation and translation was smooth except for Gallery  I had to download a 3rd party app because Google Photos just doesnt work as well as my old Gallery did and I dont like all my photos automatically going to the CloudThis is my first smart phone Ive had a flip phone for years So it is frustrating to use for nowgetting help from various sources Love the photo qualityPurchased Aug 17th  Within 2 weeks of buying the phone I dropped it and shattered the screen  The new replacement was easy and fast but I noticed quite a difference in the batteries of the 2  Moto Zs    My 1st phone seemed to lose battery power Very quickly with normal use and usually I found I had to charge it by mid afternoon  It also took a long time to charge and I was honestly getting somewhat annoyed   The phone I have now is wonderful and the battery is great  No need to charge it as often and the charging time is so much faster  All the settings were identical for each phone   I honestly think that anyone who is having battery issues needs to go get it checked and hopefully you can return it for a replacement  It seems like some of the batteries are faulty 
The Moto Z is a fantastic phone and I am so glad I bought it
I hope they correct the battery problem  
The only other request I would like is that they make All cell phones shatter proof We certainly pay enoughA little different from previous Motorola but learning something new everydayI bought this phone one week ago  So far so good  Lots of fun features  The moto mods are cool and easy to use I have the JBL speakerbattery  Battery life is OK but my old Droid MAXX held a charge longerThis was the smallest phone that verizon offers with the exception of the iphone and it is still way too big  Since i dont like apple the iphone wasnt an option for me  I miss my android mini  This phone is big enough that it is actually difficult to hold onto  Im over 6 tall so its not like I am a petite person with small hands eitherGreat phone but has some hiccups playing videosI love this phone and the Moto mods I wish it had custom themes and a headphone jack Other than that I absolutely love it I love the always listening device I love the software on the phone Its so quick The fingerprint scanner is one of the best I have used on any phone The Moto speaker dock is so awesome It makes listening to music a pleasureI bought this phone a week ago an already want to get another for my wifeReminds me of my galaxyI thought I might have a hard time transitioning to the larger size of the Moto Z coming from a Droid Turbo but I am very happy with the bigger screen The thinness of the phone is also great I am however very disappointed in the batter life of the phone Fully charged in the morning I find myself having to recharge by noon every dayeasy to use and looks great with the thin designHad phone a few weeks so far so good  Bit I didnt realize that there was no spot for ear buds I only realized it when I went to plug in ear bugs the other day  So I t would be nice to havePurchased the Moto Z Droid to upgrade a Droid Turbo In the weeks I have owned it I have found it to be fast and user friendly Problems I have discovered are network drops and GPS loss in areas I have never had problems before It is nice to have the SD Card backDont let the small battery size fool you  This phone is super frugal on standby time  With normal in and out checking email minor use for navigation some internet searches and a few apps this phone can easily last all day  Processor is very fast does not seem like you wait for anything but downloads  This thing is so ridiculously thin I have been calling the plain back that comes with it my training back since every time I take it off the phone feels too thin compared to my Droid Turbo so I put it back on  Eventually I will probably take the plain back off permanently Builtin speaker is decent  The improvements to Moto are very nice  Hands free in the car is improved because the commands got simpler It seems like the phone interprets the commands much more accurately also I did not buy this phone because of the fingerprint reader I was never one to lock my phone anyway because of the nuisance of unlocking it every time I wanted to look at it  However this fingerprint reader is so simple to set up and use I am now using it every day It is no more difficult than pressing a home button and works every time  I set it for my index finger on my right hand and my thumb on the left and it works every time I have had other family members try to open it with the reader and it always stays locked  Charge time is insanely short  It usually takes less than an hour to come up from 3540 to full charge And unlike my Droid Turbo the turbo charge on the car actually works on turboDont be fooled by the battery size This phone is optimized and the battery lasts
Super fast phone smooth as silk didnt want a plastic screen so I chose this over the force I am very happy with this purchaseI only had it a week Cant wait to get the speaker mod for it Only issue there is no headphone jack in the phone I have to use a additional piece for my headphone and aux cord in my car So now I gotta make sure I dont lose it  I like that you can add speakers but you cant have a headphone jackI purchased the Moto Z Force a week or so ago and Im satisfied overall One thing that did throw me off guard was that there was no Aux cord hole Im a big fan of the Aux cord As my vehicle does not have Bluetooth Im always reaching for the cord It is great that I am still able to listen to my own music with the alternative cord for my phone but it seemed like that was the only thing that was missingOnly had it for week now never liked moto before but this phone is awesome for even a 54 yr old like me havent been this pleased with a cell phone in couple of years tried I phone Samsung HTC Asus several brands but this tops them all no hype just facts love this phone once it catches on it will give iPhone and Samsung run for their money I give it a 10Very fast phone Screen is great and the battery life is fantastic Just picked up the battery Moto Mod and it is really easy to use and adds wireless charging too Happy so farVerizon needs to make their long time customers feel appreciated without trying to change their plans  increasing charges where other carries are notEasy to use and get familiar withShould have stayed with Samsung  I dont like that you have to have an adapter to have headphones plugged in and I dont always use wireless headphones so keeping up with an adapter is inconvenientThe battery life is terrible  Motorolas fix  basically dont use the phone  For lack of a better term I was shamed by a motorola rep for my phone having a screen time of 5 12 hours in one day  Honestly I would certainly not consider that heavy use of a smart phone  As a professional most of us use our phones hours a day for emails and work productivity I am no different  The battery life should last at least 12 hours of moderate use This does not

Furthermore the other fix was to turn off either data or wifi every time every time Im not using my phone  How is that in line with how a typical smart phone user uses and depends on their phone  Its not  My Samsung S4 Active at 3 12 years old had a better battery life  This phone is also heavy and the location of the volume controls are awkward especially for people with smaller hands like myself  

I have taken to deleting or disabling every app I do not need or is not necessary for running this phone  That means there are quite a few apps I use in my day to day life as a professional I have yet to install in fear of further battery draw  I certainly did not think a new phone would limit my ability to be productive and I fear this one will

Additionally this phone is poor in quality in terms of durability and construction  I had it three days and the screen cracked  For the record it was not dropped stepped on sat on or mishandled in any way  My S4 Active that thing was dropped down concrete steps basement steps swiped off countertops onto ceramic floors etc not a crack to be found  Im extremely disappointed in this phones durability and quality construction  

As for the technology of the phone its okay The picture quality is sufficient for my use of this product    

For this being a product Motorola put out to compete with Samsung and Apple I believe it fails miserably  I should have stuck with Samsung and gone for the S7Already drop it 10 times still works finethis phone has everything you need Very thin and very powerful  I dont like that they changed from microusb to usbcBought this a week ago and the design is pretty neat  The camera is good the battery lasts what you would typically imagine but it fully charges in an hour which is great  A few downfalls is that the sound when you are talking and have it on speaker is quite soft  Also there is no headphone jack which seems quite oddFair phone compared to my old oneNothing about this phone makes me go wow It works It is extremely slippery You have to buy a case or risk easily dropping it  Without the extra attachable speaker its really quiet I was super bummed that I cant set the alarm with my music anymore Also bummed it doesnt have some of the features on my old phone Stepped backwards I guess Oh wellI got the Droid Moto Z Force a few weeks ago And I am in love Its not to bulky and its fast And the mods are incredible Especially the JBL speakerBought this phone 1 week ago So far so good Just came from an iphone 5c I was ready to go to an AndroidOnly complaint is that I can no longer text with only one hand as the screen is too big and I cant reach the far side of the keyboard Also the phone does not come with a cord that has a USB end So I had to special order one so I can connect it to my laptopBy far the best droid phone out there  extremely fastso Ive only had the phone for a few weeksso maybe its great for features etc  But a part broke off at the top where the SD chip and SIMM card go in the second time it was opened up before I even left the store  Poorly designed and even more poorly gluedNo photo or video to addHave had for 4 days now super fast light weight and works great  Couldnt ask for a better phoneBought a week ago 60 contacts didnt download big learning curve from old phone Still playing with itIt runs Androi but I put the windows 10 skin on it so I have my familiar tiles with all the advantages of Android The phone charges super fast screen is nice and big while the phone is light and thin The Mods are easy to changeModular design and add on are the bestOnly have had it for a couple of weeks  Enjoying the featuresCant believe how great his phone is my concept mods good if they can grow the line of products offered X mods I have the audio version and it is unbelievable phone is fantastic best phone ever battery life is incredible charging time is incredible it is greatHave had phone for about two weeks  Works well very clear with phone calls  Picture quality is not the best  Has a lot of great features however some are tricky to learn how to use  Lots of upgrades from previous droid phonesBought as a birthday gift for my wife she absolutely loves this phonePurchased 2 weeks ago and absolutely love itI got this phone to replace an Samsung Note4 I didnt want to spend the money for the Note 7   So I settled on this  It isnt a Note 7 but good value for what it does    Screen  is a little smaller than it looks since soft home and back buttons take up part of the screen   Battery life isnt quite as long as I would like

I love the finger print readerthe wireless does not work as well as old phoneBattery does not last as long as they sayThe Moto Z is a great phone Whether unlocking via the fingerprint reader or playing games this thing is fast I really appreciate that I can have a svelte phone when I want or a bulky tank if I expect to be away from my charger for an extended period The Moto Mods concept is a wonderful take on modularity I have the Incipio wireless battery Moto Mod and the JBL speaker Moto Mod Both function flawlessly with the phoneI bought this phone a week ago because my old turbo wouldnt charge Could not obtain a charging cable that would do the job I miss the ability to crop photos like my old AndroidI have had the phone a week and I love itI wish there was a place to put my ear buds in instead of an attachment piece I have to carry aroundHave been a droid user for years so I appreciate the similar functionality without having to relearn where to find everything  Battery life lasts no where near what we were told  Usually down to 50  or less by end of day with conservative usage  Husband has the same phone with the same issue Internal speaker quality when we talk does not appear to be as good as the Moto X phone cuts in and out at times when we speak  Limited options for protective cases  A little larger for my personal preference but is extremely thin which is nice  Nice mod options to be able to attachI really like the fingerprint reader and stock Android The fingerprint reader doubles as a lock screen switch I personally wouldnt want it to double as a home button nor would I want the fingerprint reader to be on the back of the device I get a full day out of a single charge and I do appreciate the fast charging My device is usually fully charged in less than 30 min The lack of a headphone adapter is not a deal breaker My previous phone has problems with dust in the 35 mm jack and had to be cleaned frequently Perhaps the USBC interface will work better The phone is super fast and the display is excellentI like the Moto z but would like to see phone cases that cover the phone with the power pack attachedThis phone has amazing quality photos  The speaker is great  Its easy to use and the battery life is amazing  Its super thin  lightweight tooMy phone runs very hot and the battery runs down in less than 2 hoursAll of my contacts didnt transfer over I cant figure out how to add contacts and I dont like how the home screen always rotates And I know I filmed 2 videos of grandchild this weekend and they are no where to be found    Im seriously thinking of returning it todaySo today August 13 2016 my phone stop charging for about  6 hours and then it started back charging and two days after I got the phone on the 6 of August and it over heated and turned off and back on And it freezes up during text and callsBought this phone for the extended battery capability Phone works great nice set of features and has endless possibilities with the add on feature So far havent had any problems and I really like that I can Uninstaller or disable a lot more of the useless apps that get stuck on these thingsI got this a couple of weeks ago and so far I have no problems with this phone is way better then my old phoneThe Moto z has been wonderful  Recommend the extra battery as it makes the phone truly last 24 hours  Love the phoneI like the ease of using the phone  I think this phone was a great purchase because the face of the phone is crisp  clear and easy to readI bought this a week ago cause my phone died  Sales Rep was great tooThis phone is smarter than me  which may make me jealous at times  I love how the intuitive popups have guided me through the process of setting up my preferences etcVery fast great response and good battery life I have the speaker mod and it is awesome it has great sound and has 5 hours of its own battery life so it doesnt drain the phone Would love to get the projector mod but for now it cost more than I am willing to payJust need to know where are my contactsUpgrade less than a weekBought this pretty much on release day and love it Everything is snappy Quick Camera is a decent quality The Moto mods are fantastic in my opinion and leave this phone will plenty of potential Love itGlad I didI would recommend itThis phone is great I always use Motorola since cell phones began This one changes one item I dont understand why the change It combines phone ring volume and notification volume Can workaround but most people want a loud ring quiet notification  Also removal of mods to use a case seems a drawback especially for the battery mod Those are the only things I can see that anyone could improve on I would absolutely recommend this phoneJust got it a week ago and it is greatVery easy to use fast charging And amazing picturesAfter a week with the Moto Z I am super impressed It was very easy to configure and personalize Data transfer was a breeze and both WiFi and Cell connection are rock solid and strong The phone is fast and the mods work great I have the JBL Soundbooster and the Incipio battery mod The battery mod gives me 2 days before charging and adds little weight Droid is back with a scorching hot smartphoneI have had this phone for over a week now and overall I am happy with it  Pictures are  great with super high resolution  Only complaint so far is battery life and if I use the phone frequently I may need to recharge during the dayThe most difficult part is that this phone did not come with any set up booklet and I am having a devil of a time trying to figure things out Additionally it wont sync with my Fitbit nor my Bluetooth speakers  I think I have paid a lot for a phone I am unsureof This phone was just released a couple days ago and I waited for my upgrade to be able to get it  I bought the accessories and within one day my phone broke  The screen is more sensitive than the iPhone  It says its got Gorilla Glass but thats a joke really light drop shattered everything  I loved my turbo and it was durable  Would not recommend this to any oneLove my new phone Very easy to useGreat battery life Battery mod is excellent east to useSo glad I finally decided it was time for new phoneI am happy I stuck with Samsung I have had the s3 s5 now the s7 loved them allA little awkward without a back at first but very nice with the snap on back and the mods attached Excellent battery life and with the battery pack it lasts 2 full days Camera quality is nice but with the ois it can be tricky when moving too much Besides that wonderfulIts been two weeks and Im slowly learning but love everything about it and easier to read emails and phone numbersI would like someone to call me because this is been a horrible experience my device is not working properly what so ever and I have 2 already exchanged it for another device with having it with about five days of use this is not right my proximity sensor does not work whatsoeverI bought this phone 1 week ago 90 sure I would take it back Why Because ive been using Iphones since the VERY first one a decade ago  I tried android about 3 years ago and immediately returned the phone and stuck with Iphone  I dont know if its this phone or how far android has come but I am a convert  The power of the phone is amazing Everything opens in an instant its quick to open apps browse youtube etc  Everything is fast  I love the option to review texts etc with the press of my finger rather than opening the phone  
As for the moto z  Its a GORGEOUS phone  Quaity steel construction and beautiful glass front  My only complaint would be the HUGE camera bump However the phone is too thin  yes i said too thin so I use the included back plate at all times anyway completely negating the camera bump
Battery life is meh   but I dont want the heavier Moto z force so Ill buy the moto mod tumi battery pack and snap that on when I need more juice
All in all im an android user now and happy to be soI bought this phone a few weeks ago and have had no problems and enjoy very much  My only issue is that my previous MotorolaDroid chargers do not work with this phone The Moto Z had different input so that is kinda a bummerThis is a huge upgrade from my previous phone 2014 Moto X but its really the mods that make this amazing  The cost of each mod is prohibitive but they function so much better than their standalone equivalents  The way they integrate into a seamless whole becomes something greater than the sum of its partsI preordered the Moto Z and received it on July 28th  Here are my impressions thus far

Battery Life  I consistently end the day with 25 remaining and thats using it primarily to text and browses the Internet via WiFi Very little 4G use at this point so be warned The only plus is the turbocharging mode that puts me at 75 in 15 minutes

Fingerprint sensor  It works great and its all I use to wake and sleep the device 

Display Bright and very readable great for games and videos

Camera  Works well but does not deliver consistent shots in the same light Being an amateur photographer I have always taken multiple shots so I usually get at least one good one anyway

Controls  The placement of the volume controls is frustrating to get used to  They moved the power button under the volume controls

Size With the Incipio Dual Pro case which incidentally I dont like the phone is even wider but still thin I have large hands so its not a problem my wife however would never want one due to the shear size For those considering buying the Moto Z the available cases will only fit on the device when there are no Moto Mods attached As an FYI the aforementioned case is a pain to remove and yet another reason it will be replaced when Otterbox releases theirs

Why I chose the Moto Z  As a software developer I prefer the minimalist Moto UI approach unlike the Samsung Touch Wiz and othersBeautiful but 
Dont  like no ear phone jack on top Being a girl I have lots of diff dust plugs for bling 
Tiny speaker at top 
Kinda heavy to be so slim 
Also no shells for girls Shes naked Bought Kates shell but too thick Was surprised since shell that came in box is great but ugly color for girls grey So bummedI bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and so far I love it It is so fast and responsive The finger print reader is instant and accurate The rear camera takes amazing quality pictures The ability to add mods to it is awesome Just wish there was more mod options The only thing I dislike about the phone is as a developer and power user having a phone with an unlockable bootloader is a HUGE drawback I have actually considered returning it and getting a different phone just for that reason However I love the phone so much I cant bring myself to return itSuper user friendly The Mod Power Pack attachment was the best inventionActuality just receive my phone last Friday Was up til 2am Saturday morning wphone There are great features and modular for this phone even turning phone into a movie projector and to use camera you just turn twist YOUR wrist back snd forth  w phone in that hand My MOTO Z DROID WOW ME You really have to experience the connection OfLove everything about it  Best Android phone I have ownedThis is a great phone Very slim very well built Comparable to iPhone 6s Plus in build quality Great screen Manageable battery life considering the size of the battery and the size of the phone Would recommend Moto Mods would fantastically attesting to included backp late JBL speaker and Tumi charger Although i have had this for a week I love it
Like my last Droid it is very easy to use and it has a nice big screen
Very user friendlyIve been using now for a few days  The volume is not loud enough and when I make or answer a call there is a long pause before Im connected  It does not have as good features as the LG and the camera does not have good share optionsI love the phone and all the options and Mods But battery is weak and doesnt last more than half a day and I do not use the phone much Have you charge it twice a day My Droid turbo was betterI got the Moto z about a week ago now I love the device but hate how much trouble I am having finding a charger aside from the FAR OVER PRICED ones at the Verizon store I cant seem to find one locally so its order one online or waitIt cannot be left understated just how premium and beautiful this phone is

I have used Motorola products since the first ever Razr I had every keyboarded Droid and all 3 Moto X devices This lives up to the legacy of those devices and then some 

Best performance and smoothest animations I have seen on any smartphone to date The Moto Z is incredibly thin so even when you have mods attached its no thicker than most other phones on the market

The battery lasts surprising long despite being so comparatively small on the regular Z

The mods have been very useful so far as well The JBL mod is loud and clear and has its own battery so it doesnt drain the phone The power packs are probably the most useful so farIt keeps the phone juiced up all day to where its still sitting around 80 after more than 14 hours Thats with fairly heavy usage too And the Kate Spade power pack is utterly gorgeous tooReceived the phone friday activated it saturday screen shattered sundayThen this is the review for you I upgraded from the Samsung S6 edge and Im very happy I did The droid force seems to have a little bit stronger antenna as indicated by the signal bar and hangs onto the 4g signal longer Moto version of Android is a lot smoother and has less bloat than Samsungs Android but Samsung has more customization options on the home screen 

Battery life on the Moto is good enough to last all day and the turbo charging system is good enough to give you about a 20 percent boost or more in 15 minutes If there is a Moto mod attached and the phone is plugged in it will charge the phone and mod at the same time Camera quality is great and very quick to launch

Moto mods work very well The phone comes with a dark wood looking back cover and is held on with magnets If you get a case the back cover has to be removed in order to fit I got the JBL speakers with the phone and they work great Just pull the back cover off and pop the selected mod on The only thing I dont like is some of the mods are quite expensiveI swap devices often so I have been through many many phones and I can safely say that even though I have owned this phone only a few days it has risen to one of my all time favorites The build quality of this device is on point Its feel in the hand is just as nice as its looks And when they say this phone is thin THEY MEAN IT Even though it is crazy slim I do not feel like this is a device I would easily crush or bend 

Not only is this device beautiful its software is near perfect too LenovoMotorola did a great job of not adding in senseless apps that Google had already created with Android I dont need to worry about choosing between Motorolas calendar app and Googles calendar app because there is only one Same with the calculator and the web browser and so on Its a fresh clean Android device with no heavy skins on the software like some other manufacturers

And finally the innovation of this device is so nice Its modular system is fantastic It really shows how adaptable and flexible an Android device can be I am sorry to see so few Moto Mods out so far but I can tell you that the ones that are out work GREAT And with Motorolas Modular Development Kit I cannot wait to see what other people can come up withI traded up from a LG G3 horrible phone btw and I have been so pleased with my new phone The Mods work seamlessly and hot swapping batteries is a thing of the past It does come with one back panel  I cant wait to get more and I got the JBL speaker and the Incipio battery pack 

The phone itself is blazing fast and when I speed tested it against a S7 it actually preformed better just by a hair though The battery is a little small but the extra battery pack makes up for that The Speakers are crazy loud for how small they are and this phone is incredibly thin

My only issue with the phone is that if you put a case on your phone you cannot use the mods without taking your case off Going to see how that plays out for me but I have never broken a phone yet cross my fingers and toes I didnt curse myself there LOLI just got the phone and im ready to take back TheThis seems to be a excellent device I traded my s7 edge for it While I will miss Samsung pay using the mods is a plus for me I got the battery mod myself and I must admit it is very well done Much better then the G5 The device is lag free Has expandable storage Feels great and very well built Very happy so far with this deviceTo of the line Android My favorite phone or right now The price is a little high The mods are cool excited for the futureHot swap moto mods are fantastic need more choices Size and function options of the Moto Z are great The first year everything runs smoothly fast great battery lifethen it changes Battery life drains away to the point where I must leave it on charge most of the time The phone randomly gets very hot Bluetooth connection drops Cannot find wifi routers though there are multiple available ones that the phone had connected to before Then theres the perpetual rebooting I actually had to reset the phone back to factory twice Now is slow and battery life is minimal The camera was great to start with now it drags to open and focus by then the great shot you shook your phone for has gone Oh and no upgrade to Pie available I wish the execution lived up to the concept Very disappointed my phone suddenly turns off with the battery charged when I want to turn it on it is 3 charged It is impossible to believe that I connect it to the charger and 80 on the screen okay I unplug it and do not spend even 20 minutes and it turns off again
This is a martyrdom for me I feel cheated by you my motoz play phone started to suddenly turn off when the battery was charged I can not work because I make a call and it turns off I open an application and it turns off and it only stays on having it connected to the charger This product is defective
I followed step by step all the solutions and I can not find a way to make this I tried all the tips and there is no solution there is no solution
You want to give life to a phone with an operating system that has two years of life  in that way then we should buy a new phone
Is that what it is about
Ive had motorola for almost 20 years Ive grown up with each model and I feel like I will not buy another motorola because Im very disappointed The internet is full of customers that own these phones and when the updates happen the battery will not stay charged The interesting thing is I didnt have any problems with any of the updates until after the phone was paid off
I believe this is a ploy to force people to upgrade I will never buy a Moto or anything produced by Levono again I have had mine 8 months  Love the phone but now i cant use my phone unless it is plugged in  The battery mod wont keep it charged either Purchased Moto Z 2 years ago at full price After 1 12 years the phone started with battery issues It would shut down when I tried to take a picture when the battery was 80 When the phone would power back on it would show a low battery of around 10 At first I thought it was a camera issue But battery went downhill from there A few weeks later the battery was so bad that I needed to keep it connected to a portable power bank at all times Now I have to tote around this phone with a power bank connected to it The second I unplug the phone from the power bank phone shuts off Same when I connect phone to turbo charger the second I unplug the phone from charger it shuts off This is unacceptable and I will never buy or recommend a Moto phone again I bought this phone less than 2 years ago I now have problems with its battery It would shut down erratically Sometimes it would shut down when the battery is at 35 or the other times when it is 20 I took it for repair three times they changed the battery but now it doesnt charge I would not recommend this phone to anyone I bought this phone last year and after a year using it i have notice that the battery drained fast I have to charge my phone all the time for me to be able to use it otherwise its unusable at all I did factory reset on this phone but still same thing  Battery sucks So far Ive loved my Moto Z even though Ive had a few problems but the battery issue is NO LONGER tolerable The phone has to be charged 3 or 4 times a day and its driving me crazy It will completely cut off with 35 battery remaining Some times it says its charging but when I look at the battery details under settings it says not charging which requires an unplug and replug The charger isnt the problem as I have 3 different chargers and the same thing happens with all of them These are genuine Motorola chargers not aftermarket junk There are no mods on my phone Not a terrible number of aps All pictures are backed up and cleared off frequently Cache is cleared regularly 

Original phone purchased Nov 2016
RIP Phone 1 Dec 2016 brand new  Bluetooth was broken couldnt be repaired 
               Was issued a refurbished phone as a replacement even though I was 
                 still paying for brand new device
RIP Phone 2  March 2017   Phone started smoking when I plugged it in to charge 
RIP Phone 3  March 2018  Phone started randomly rebooting 
Phone 4  My current phone and the battery has been an issue for about 3 months now Battery died with less than a year I was lucky they sent a new one My six year old phone works better than this phone  My eleven year old phone works better than this phone  There were no problems until that one update and yall cant be bothered to fix it  Waste I use this phone for business so it is more than just an inconvenience when the battery dies with no warning  It will tell me I have 64 but then I go to open a window or take a picture and it just turns off  Plug it in says it has 35 so turn it back on and it dies again  Would love to have Motorola contact me about this As with many others I had thoroughly enjoyed this phone with the moto mods and the long battery life and turbo charging but then after about a year of use I had the same issue as has been reported wouldnt hold a charge consistently  Its especially a problem because with the investment in motomods I had expected to use this phone for longer than a normal phone I have had my phone for a year or two now It was a great phone but now even at 80 it will randomly shut off When I try to turn it back on itll just shut off again or show its at 0 and not turn on until I put it on the charger Mine got stuck in an infinite loop of trying to turn on get to the blue screen with the red M then shut off and try again I did a factory reset on it and it didnt help the situation at all I wont be buying another Motorola product after this fiasco Battery dies after a few months Even after the battery is replaced with the OEM part it died after 2 weeks again battery does not work at all has to be plugged all the time volume buttons do not work after 8 months Battery drains rapidly from 100 to 6070 then goes to 0 in seconds since software update  Motorola aware of the issue but not addressing

Positively ridiculous Once you download Android 80 on this phone you will only be able to use it while plugged into the wall The battery life goes from 100 to 0 before I can even switch from home charger to car charger I just bought it last Xmas now I have to get a new one First Year work perfect Camera Battery Life After a Year issues started I did system update battery life dead when a have 50 battery and take a picture phone shout down and battery drain from 50 to 3 first when I bought thought Moto z was 
 one of the best phone for my but now I dont spend none on motorola products any more Its a great phone  battery lastest forever But I would the screen to be bigger  Wife and I both bought Moto Z Droid phones 2 years ago to replace our Samsung S4s  We liked the unique features of this phone and it was easy to use

However about 1 year into our 2 year contract my wifes phones battery degraded and the phone started acting strange  Acting strange meaning the phone would report the battery percentage as falling rapidly the phone would spontaneously reboot and the battery percentage would gap down after reboot for eg from 50 percent to 2 percent  Then the phone would just die
She got a replacement phone under the protection plan but the replacement phones bluetooth didnt work hence a 2nd replacement phone  which worked

I use my phone less than her now after 2 years its starting to have the gap down battery issue my wifes previous phone had so its basically on its way to dying

Longevity is certainly not a strong point of this phone Phone was great for about 11 months Battery drain is out of control and came out of nowhere Phone will completely shut off within an hour of being 100 This phone is still being sold for an extremely high price when Motorola should replace all of our phones On top of that their other z phones are sold out So goodbye Moto been using yalls phones since the flip phone days Never again At first this phone was a very nice purchase and seemed worth every penny  However after 2 years Ive had 3 different Moto Z droids and it has all been because eventually the battery would fail to take a charge or the USB C charging port would start to fail to recognize the fast charging Missing IR blaster for remote control devices no Photo Gallery app only Google Photos and several bugs Smart Lock is not working and you cannot disable the gradual volume option Until I upgraded to Oreo there wasnt a File Manager either I have always loved Motorola Products and have become brand loyal for years March 2017 I got the new Moto Z There was a system update end of AprilBeginning of May 2018 and after that my phone would freeze randomly shut off get extremely hot and be at 90100 batter life then shut off and not turn back on saying the batter was dead I went in to Verizon and it was replaced

Last week another system update came through and here we are again SAME EXACT ISSUES This second phone is not even 6 months old Now I have to take the time to go to the store and do all over again 

This phone is a lemon I am extremely disappointed in Motorola and Lenovo as I have become fans of both 

Do not buy this phone All the good things it does isnt worth the hassle of it crashing I have a small child and travel a lot for work I depend on my phone greatly Unfortunately I cannot rely on this one at all

NOTE Both times I had done Factory Resets as suggested and it does NOTHING If you look in multiple chat groups this happens to hundreds of people and they are all told to do the Factory Restore as the solution and it NEVER works I used Moto G 1st gen for five years and as an upgrade I bought this phone in January 2018 First five months were amazing Then the camera quality reduced gradually After that now the phone restarts randomly for no good reason It has been some time since upgrading to oreo no new applications were installed One morning it just started rebooting I calibrated the battery as instructed in forums performed hard reset wipe etc NO CHANGE This phone is not reliable and Motorola needs to do something My phone is not even 2 years old  I can only get 3hrs on battery saver mode of use from a full charge Thats using the factory charger  letting the phone charge to 100 Sometimes the phone decided to power down at 4050 battery life then when you plug it power it back on it says its at 3 battery life I called Motorola support  they said that this is not a know issue that it sounds like my phone is getting old thats why the battery is not working as well as a brand new one I added a battery app on my phone yesterday to see exactly how many times I have to charge the phone on different chargers just to make it through the day  a two day total has been 78 times Thats pretty said considering Im a moderate phone user who works 10 he shifts once I get to work I rely on my office phone  computer because my cell is so unreliable and may dye at any given moment Accubattery on my Moto Z says it has 32 of remaining usable capacity from when it was new of 3000mAh 

It is not an error It is a total of about 75 perhaps 100 full recharge cycles amount of watthours into the battery

The battery is heavily degraded I take a video and stop the video every few minutes and see it 10 less And the phone can have power cut to it if below 50 or so if taking a video or something taxing 

I have only used this for about 9 months before it was in a box partially charged 

I do leave it plugged in most of the time Phone manufactures should put in a mode to only charge up to 80 which yes I know the Moto mod efficiency mode will do Relatiely inexpensive for the 2220mAh one so I ordered that to let my phone limp along Ill see how well that works with the degraded battery But it should just be an option without the mod just as many laptops can now and most electric cars

Same battery degradation has happened with my Moto G4 twice I had it replaced once under warranty after about 9 months Replacement was degrading too but then i upgraded 

Its proof I think that the battery cell chemistry used is junk Along with all the other bad reviews and posts AWill the Z2 have the same issues Well see 

Another issue is the glass or plastic cover for the camera the lens it broke soon after I started using it while in my pocket 
Also it thermally throttles the SOC if the battery gets about 40C in order to keep the battery from getting too warm Results in very slow performance in the summer time I was surprised by the low rating  I have had this phone for over a year  I originally intended to update my phone every year but I see no point in changing it right now as the Moto Z unlocked still appears to have the highest specs and it still works flawlessly Great phone esthetically one of the nicest out there and very robust However it pretty much stopped functioning a month after the warranty ended so a little more than year after purchase It just switches off randomly a dozen times a day even with a full charge and takes 510 tries to switch on again The same thing happened with my previous Moto phone so I guess it is actually a feature of the brand After using Motorola Moto Z for about a year Im totally disappointed about this product Battery life is so pure it dies in a couple of hours When the battery is below 40 it might suddenly shut down and when turning back on its on 1 worst battery life I have ever seen 

For the finish Ive accidentally broke the screen and I cant replace it here in Georgia as everyone in a digital service centers say that this product was a total fail and theyre not getting any replacements for this model Had this phone for 15 years and love this phonewill buy one for wife I have owned this phone for a little over a year and a half at this point Initially this phone worked great and functioned in every way that you would expect a smartphone to do I had the battery and speaker mod and both work great After about a year of owning the phone began to frequently lock up with the most recent image frozen on the screen Id have to reset the phone for it to function Other times it would get extremely hot and the battery would drain very quickly More recently it has become nearly unusable It will frequently shut down at random battery percentages 50 75 85 even 95 to 100 Recently it has even been turning off despite being plugged into the wall charger and saying that it has 100 charge Often if a text or phone call comes in the phone will just turn off as soon as it starts ringing I can no longer rely on this device as a phone or even for browsing the internet while its plugged into wall power  Researching on the internet this seems to be a somewhat common problem with no apparent solution Do not buy this phone if you hope for it to reliably function for more than 1 year I have been using this phone for 6 months now There are no major glitches However at times the cell phones used to freeze during initial days when I had made a couple of updates Now with no updates it works smooth Battery life is good if you can turn the location off Battery dies off early than other phones as its only 2300 mAh with 57 inches Ive had mine for over a year now and it still works very well most of the time My main concern is the battery life It is absolutely horrible And that was  one of the big selling points that made me decide to buy the phone If wasnt for the 3800 MAH Moto mod battery Id be in very bad shape And the stock speaker started getting fuzzy in less than 3 months And now the turbo charger barely works either Since the last update the fingerprint sensor has become an absolutely worthless button Unless Im missing something But worst of all Ive come to realize that Motorola does not hold its resale 
value like Samsung or iPhone Even though they cost pretty close to the same brand new Ive had alot of internal problems with this phone my on and off button doesnt work and my volume button do not work Ive only had for a year I have to trade in because I dont like it anymore Thank you I have had no issues and the phone has been though a lot of punishment It is a great phone My battery on my Moto Z Droid at 100 will drop incredibly fast In 5 minutes it will drop to 80 without use Battery life is minimum under 20 minutes The phone shuts off at around 60 and will not turn on unless plugged in When charging it states random percentages My phone when manually shut off will not turn back on and taking pictures also shuts the phone off My battery does not last through a night I must plug it in I have tried different restarts and do not have any large apps or apps running in the background My phone is unreliable These phones are also expensive and problems occurred after warranty I tried customer service and they did not know what the problem was many other motorola phone users have the same problem like me The phone did exactly what I wanted to and I daresay I was even happy for a whileThat all changed once the battery began to fail The phone was treated well and looking at online forums its easy to see that I am not an isolated case The Moto Z droid is plagued with battery issues What do I mean by battery issues Its just depressing My phone can now barely survive 23 hours of use before it dies from full charge If you ever restart your phone and are lucky to have it actually work it comes back stating you have 15 battery left I cant play games take picsvideo below 65 battery because my phone will just shut off 

This phone is truly garbage Naturally these issues happened the month after the 12 month warranty expired junk 3rd one in less then a year sending back again under manufacturer warranty You have been forewarned On multiple occasions while using this phone it would turn completely off due to the battery running out when the bar says it is at 30that should not happen on any phone this is my 5th moto it is clearly a defective devise i want a note i will pay the difference but swapping this phone 5 times for defects is a pain please help Battery life is TERRIBLE Camera quality is subpar at best Didnt realize there was no phone jack on this model never thought I would have to check for that on a phone I honestly loved this phone It was fast thin and had plenty of storage of me For the first year I had this phone I would have argued with anyone the the Moto Z was the best phone on the market  Then literally two days after my year warranty was up I did a system update and my battery started draining in 3 hours  I had to put my phone on airplane mode if I wanted it to last more than 6 hours So since I couldnt afford to fork out another couple hundred on a phone I bought a Motorola battery mod  This boosted my battery life quite a bit  However once the mod battery is dead my phone shortly follows Once my phone is using its own battery it completely shuts down around 30  Once it is plugged in it still states the battery is at 30  My phone shuts off on a daily basis  Im extremely bummed that this phone has been such a disappointment Have been with Verizon since September of 2017 and we have had so many problems definitely has been a bad decision on our end My phone is terribly slow never can get my problems resolved And its not just one phone its 3 phones on my plan If you like charging your phone at least twice a day and having to reconnect your bluetooth then this is the phone for you
Plus side is when you do charge it which is often it does charge quickly  

Ive had this phone a little over a year It was awesome for the first few months then suddenly it went downhill after about 6 months I now have to carry around a portable battery charger so my phone doesnt die while Im running errands My phone used to connect automatically when I got in the car then it randomly didnt connect I renamed my phone and reconnected and that worked for a few weeks then I had to repeat the process 

Im really sad about this because the phone really was nice but I just cant handle this batterybluetooth issue Let me start out by saying Im very familiar with cellphones and reasonably technologically competent This phone took a slight learning curve to get used to The settings are very different from another Android based phone Ive used Settings are nearly impossible to change Simple stuff like changing the quiet mode times and Bluetooth connections Ive had the phone for about a year now and will never buy a Motorola product again

pros It does have a pretty decent camera and I like the quick charger I loved this phone when I first got it As soon as I had it a year of course no longer under warranty it started having issues Sometimes the speaker does not work so when someone calls I cant hear them and they cant hear me Lucky for me restarting it seems to help But the most annoying part the battery I pick my phones for their battery life so the fact that it is now an issue sucks It does not fully charge have tried other chargers so that is not the problem If I am lucky It will charge up to 85 But it will turn off because the battery is to low as soon as it hits 55 I pretty much have to have it plugged in all the time If I dont even when I am not using it I am lucky if it stays on for 2 hours 
I just hate this phone and I wish there was something I could do but you also can not replace the battery in this phone So Im pretty much stuck with a phone that has to but plugged in all the time for another year
By the way I am very careful with my phones it hasnt been dropped and has no damage battery is horrible not sure what type of airplane grade aluminum is used and the glass is fragile have seen many that are not holding up well at all I even remember seeing claims on how strong the glass was and touting no worries if it breaks just let us knownot seeing these claims anymore  I have been a loyal Motoral user and unfortunatley have invested too much in the Mods if I did not would have switched to Apple most likely probably still will just pay the price litreally too bad Motorola Had to purchase the moto mod battery for all day use  September 2017 update from Verizon caused the hotspot and Bluetooth to stop working  Verizon sent me another one but now I have a phone that randomly reboots for no reason which is a real problem when using gps maps for travel PROS Shortcut Flashlight Feature Shortcut Camera Feature Fingerprint unlock feature 2 SplitScreen feature that works only for certain apps Turbo Charging Feature Attractive slim phone

CONS Probably the worst phone battery life Ive had in my 10 years with Verizon The pop out camera lens gets scratched very easy Therefore it ruins the camera quality permanently unless you replace it just to get it scratched again No AUX port Uses USB Type C charging port Therefore you would have to convert all your micro USB chargers to USB type C plus you would preferably offset the AUX port with something Bluetooth but now you have 2 different chargers to take care of Overly sensitive built in Mic I cant record any live concerts because the playback would sound like blown speakers I had the moto for 4 months Nothing to complain about reallygood call receptionnice screennot so great battery lifehad to get the battery mod to make it threw the day Ended up trading it in for the note 8 which in a different league altogatherthe moto is worth your time if a good deal is found I already reviewed this phone a week ago and apparently it got taken down so I will make this one shorter   This phone is GARBAGE  It runs slower than John Candy  It seems like something is running in the background causing it to be almost useless however there is nothing running   If my phone is anywhere below 45 charged and I try to take a picture using flash it turns off  drains the entire battery  I hit the power button and it shows about 4   Plug it in  sometimes it will instantly show 25 and turn back onother times it will even show 100   Even brand new this phones battery life was atrocious  Ive had it since last Christmas and it has been nothing but trouble   The camera when it doesnt render my phone useless is nice  Thats about the only good thing I can say  I wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone   Actually Id try and call my friends and tell them never to buy this phone but im sure my phone would turn off before they have a chance to answer The function of this phone is slow and sloppy  The only people that seem to like it are Motorola fans  It does not have gorilla glass  We have four phones and two have been dropped landing flat on the screen and the out screens are broke  Every time the put out an update the configuration has changed  The software on the phone is not just about completely different from when we first purchased these phone  The battery does not last half the life they tell you it does  With the last update they finally fixed the turbo charging feature that didnt work for about a year  If you have small hand this is a two hand phone  The mods that they offer are nothing special  They are all hype and no show  Save your money and get a real phone thats not a Motorola  This company has simple gone down hill I attempted to upgrade from a two year old droid turbo that I thought was slow due to its age This phone was no faster than my old one and in some cases I think it may have been slower  This was the only Motorola phone the store had so I took it I live on a farm 30 miles from town so my service isnt the greatest but my old phone would last 18 hours and then some being in my poor coverage area The moto z lasted four hours and was looking for a charge and I made one eight minute phone call and three texts in that time  I returned the phone after seven days and had my old phone turned back on This was about our 10th Motorola telephone This new Droid is the worst decision I have made in purchasing a phone The camera lens sticks out such that it scratches and cracks within a few months and it is your responsibility to pay to fix it In addition the connector for charging stopped working after a few months on both of our phones  We  have to use a wireless charger and a large battery pack on the back of the phone to recharge  Motorola customer service which we had never called in the prior 10 years of having Motorola phones is abysmal I was due for my upgrade so I went to Verizon and wanted the Samsung galaxy edge 7 I was told they didnt have any in stock so the pushed the Moto Z on me I told them I needed at least 64 GBthey said the Moto only comes in 32GB but you can buy an SD card for more memory I bought the SD card but the only thing I can transfer onto it is pictures  videosI cant transfer apps to it so many times i have to delete an app before I can download a new one
The phone has a HORRIBLE problem with shutting itself off Many times i have been at 2735 battery life and it will shut itself off Other times i will be at full battery life and it will continually shut off and on for 20 minutes before I have to do a hard reset My prior phone was a Moto X 2nd gen The Moto Z Play is a step up in every way This is a mid range phone with great performance Where it excells is in battery life I dont have to carry a charger or a battery pack to work any more I can get two full days out of the battery  I really like Motorola and there approach  to smartphones I buy sell and trade devices I have had iPhones Samsung Galaxy devices HTC LG Sony and many Motorola devices I keep coming back to Motorola because they simply offer the best overall package and performance available

The Moto Z Droid is an outstanding device Excellent build quality top of the line specs for 2016 with the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB RAM along with expandable storage and a recent upgrade to Android Nougat 711

Performance is smooth without so much as a hiccup Motorola has the vanilla Android with Moto flavor perfected Yes you have the Verizon bloat but these can be disabled if not removed Any application or game you throw at this will fly Period

Camera performance has improved with the 711 update Not as big of an improvement as afforded the Z Play huge improvement but this 13mp shooter didnt need a huge upgrade It performs quite well for most anyone who isnt a photographer Pictures on the Z have a clear and neutral color quality not oversaturated It records 4k video at 30 fps but more importantly for me it shoots 1080p at 60 fps There is a noticeable difference in any device between 30 and 60 fps You will appreciate this if you take a lot of video

My biggest pet peeve with smartphones is their poor battery life Admittedly I was concerned about the 2600 mAh battery in the Z Dont be It isnt the battery champ the Play is my Play is currently at 23 hours battery time at 51 percent  with 4 hours and 33 minutes onscreen time running 711 However it performs quite well in its own right and gets me an average of 4 hours plus onscreen time Standby time is also outstanding Battery drain is minimal when left not chargingand screen off 

Why get the Z over its midrange brother the Z Play Well I have both so here is what I like about the Z Its thinner much thinner at only 52 mm thick and just feels so premium in the hand I put a carbon fiber skin on this using a style shell from Incipio on the back and it looks and feels fantastic in the hand I also have a leather Moto style shell that feels great Also if you add the battery packs available the phone doesnt feel huge I use these on longer trips and they easily get me over a day and no fatigue from the extra width or weight 

The Z adds the quad HD display versus the 1080p on the Play Both look excellent However side by side you will appreciate the difference between them The Z also uses Gorilla Glass 4 for superior clarity The Force for example has Shattershield but it wont look quite as good as this I have a Skinomi polycarbonate screen protector on it and it feels perfect Its also well protected 

Call quality is fantastic as is the norm from Motorola devices Reception is excellent and WiFi Calling is perfect for rural areas with spotty reception and an available WiFi connection Neither Samsung nor Apple come close in call clarity to these Moto Z devices I have an iPhone 6s as a work device and have owned many Samsungs They simply dont compare if you still use your phone to talk

The elephant in the room for this device and the Z Force is the lack of a headphone jack If you use Bluetooth headphones it wont matter If you use wired cans you will need to use the USBC dongle To me it isnt that big of a deal Sound quality is average an area I wish Lenovo would improve upon The HTC devices have 32 bit DAC converters which make audio through headphones sound fantastic The LG V10 and V20 also offer high end audio 

Moto isnt the sexy choice compared to Samsung and the iPhone but it is to me a better choice Simple to use lightning fast solid battery life more than acceptable camera and video a superior fingerprint sensor gorgeous 55 inch AMOLED display Gorilla Glass 4 flagship specs and superior call quality make the Z an outstanding choice Overall excellent mobile Would purchase upgraded version over again Camera quality is incredible Graphics likewise Sleek design and comes with magnet backcover only thing i love about this phone is the extended battery life with the moto mod Ive had this phone for 8 months and now it freezes up for no reason and is now extremely slow I always have the battery pack mod on for the extended life obviously but for some reason that I cannot imagine there is not a case made to fit the phone with the mod attached A case for the power pack should be made its logical I have had this phone since December   1The upgrades mess it up every time  2 the charger doesnt work to charge it   I have to use my car charger  3 the battery has to be changed a couple t times a day  4  People call and it wont let me answer them sometimes   Just this weekend I have had to turn it off and on 3 or 4 times  This usually helps receiving calls 5  It drops calls daily  6 There are dead spots on the screen   7 this has been the worst phone I have ever had and I have had cell phones for 20 years  I cant wait for my agreement time to be up so I can get something else   And I can assure you it will never be a Moto again Good phone average battery get force droid for better battery life Fast charging but have to charge twice per day with usage Ive had this phone for 6 months now  The battery life is the worst of any phone Ive had  I have to charge the phone a couple times a day to avoid a dead battery  Ive gone back to Verizon and let them know of this issue and their advice is to purchase the battery mod  Very disappointed and completely dissatisfied with this phone I have had my phone for three months and it doesnt hold up to the same standards Motorola once had My phone freezes all the time and I have to wait for it to reset itself This is a weekly issue This is the worst phone Ive ever owned Im on my 4th replacement since Nov 2016 The idea of having one speaker is a terrible design And Motorola is no help to me at trying to  resolving  this issue This phone is very heavy and difficult to text from  The extra battery pack is necessary and its a nice feature  This is my 4th smartphone but I find myself coming up with reasons not to use it I was a Samsung user until the Note 7 problem I decided to switch to Verizon from Sprint to get better service Verizon service is great Good android phone but doesnt even compare to Samsung My favorite parts of this phone is durable screen and battery life worst is the camera Cant wait to move back to another phone just not sure which direction I want to go Never liked the iPhone have one for work and dont like the curved screen on the Samsung Waiting to go to the new Note 8 Pixel 2 or if Verizon gets it the Nokia 9 After using this phone for several months I am still thrilled with it  The call quality is amazing excellent speaker phone the camera is everything that I need the quick charge is so fast battery life is adequate  So many things to love  I have two Moto modsthe battery pack 
which I rarely have to use And the JBL speaker which is wonderful  This is by far the best phone I have ever had and Ive had a LOT of phones I do not want to write in this space  I got this phone for my mother in January and she has had nothing but problems since shortly after getting it The biggest issue is the battery life it drops quickly even when not in use Now the phone has a charging issue and will not charge I took it to Verizon and they had a replacement phone sent out and guess what it has the SAME problem She is only 5 months into having the phone so trading it in is not an option at this point unless this one is paid in full so we are stuck getting asking for replacement phones that are not even new they are certified like new My moms last phone was a Motorola and she had no issues with it this Motorola not worth the price I just got 2 of these phones I have to stand in the middle of the road and calls still cut out every other word called in they got it to improve but now 2 a day it needs to update and I dont have phone coverage again Not worth owning if you cant talk on it Great Android phone Just switched to it from Samsung S7 Android OS works fine Very little built in apps that hog memory Battery life is SUPER I needed 2 full charges a day on my Samsung S7 Now I plug in my Moto at night with more than 60 charge left Fast charge feature can recharge phone from 60 to full in less than 12 hour Screen is sharp and clear Photos are great Can add micro SD card configured as main memory That means you dont have to manage memory between built in memory and extra micro SD Really recommend this phone We have been a family of Motorola phone fans but this one missed the mark Battery life is horrible and that is even with the Kate Spade battery mod The mod only ads maybe two hours to the life of the phone With minimal use my phone lasts about 8 hours with the battery mod My husband got the Force because he has damaged many phone screens in the past and he is having much more luck I know that phone has a better battery but I would expect the one on mine to at least make it through the day It also shuts off between 1020 too Definitely will consider a different brand after this experience not happy with it for the price my screen on my camera crackedshattered it freezes on me but on the other hand i love all the extras it does the talking to it and doing it for u is great but i wouldnt buy another onei would seriously look into something else from verizon A far superior product to the Galaxy S7 that also resides in our homeGreat battery for its thin profile but not the world battery champ Fingerprint ID works every time and accepts multiple scans letting you use either hand Just awesome This phone is the worst one Ive ever had  Its slow freezes up frequently and has to be rebooted the battery runs hot and shuts the phone down  I loathe it and am so sorry that I traded in my previous phone for this poor replacement The phone was awesome at 1st  I brought the battery mode and a couple of cases  Loved the feel and look of it  The speed of the phone is great as it plays all my games without any lags  The problems I first noticed were when I was using the bluetooth functions  It seems like every song would have a pause or interruption of some kind This was the case regardless of whether I was using bluetooth headphone or connecting the phone to my car stereo or home speakers  Why would they eliminate the headset jack but then use an inferior bluetooth antennae The Motorola Moto Z Droid has been a big disappointment because the camera freezes you cant assign a ring tone to a group or go between the camera and photos  Overall I feel as though Ive taken a step back in technology  

Frustrated and upset I liked my old phone better My husband and I got the Moto Z force phones When I purchased this phone I came from a note 3 I wanted the note 7 that they came out with but they no longer offer those nor did they have an note 5 so I decided to try out a Moto Z force 
If you are trying for something to compare to a Samsung this is not the phone I dont like the fact that my phone basically runs off Google everything I have big hands to while holding my phone while typing my fingers touch the glass and that messes with what I am doing My husbands works in a bodyshop he felt this phone would be a good phone to take to work Well his screen is scratched up bad his speaker barley works its crackles 
We bought these phones 6 months ago the speaker shouldnt be gone already
My Samsungs lasted me years Once we can upgrade we will be going back to Samsung I regret wasting my time and money on this phone This phone is horrible I bought this phone for my husband and after two months of having it the speaker went bad we returned it and got another one  After having another new cell phone 4 months later the camera started sticking out and I called customer service the guy was so rude and said they couldnt replace it Perfect Always have loved Motorolas products Very reliable devices and great up to date features It took awhile to get used to the new features on this phone was stoked about the turbo charging Ive now had this phone a little less than a month and am disappointed in finding that the battery isnt what I expected Ive recently been having issues with it keeping charge Its been off the charger for 3 hours and am at a 61 charge Thats just idling I dont listen to music on it anymore nor use navigation Its sad because I rave about Motorola phones as Ive always had a great history with them Might be switching to an LG I like that everything is easy to access like files such as insurance proof etc even in a bind or need to access quickly Only 2 things with the phone I dont like is the slowness of the rotation Sometimes it take forever to rotate back upright
The battery dont last long as expected phone service techs are helpful knowledgeable freindly great service in the store Store location is good as well Love the phone and features with one exception  This phone is supposedly made with Gorilla Glass but my screen cracked in three places with a 14 drop  My former Galaxy S4 had taken multiple drops from heights 34 times as high with no damage to phone or screen  Case options are limited if you plan to use any of the Mods  If you like the phone better opt for the Force model with the Shatter proof screen Phone battery is extremely poor I am being forced to buy car charger if i want 8 hour charge  Lousy service for a 20 year customer Third Motorola phone seamless transition  A camera Minor updates that make for big improvements I love Motorolas but CDMA versions are difficult to find So when I switched carriers this is the phone that I purchased I am in love with this phone and service Apps download in literally 1 second I will have a BUNCH of apps and services running at the same time and this phone and service can handle it Sometimes if I push too hard the screen will turn off and I have to wait a minute to get back in but that is totally understandable The only issue that I have is the Virtual Keyboard For some stupid reason they included an Emoticon button but when you click it the first time that comes up is flags I mean come on flags So you have to get used the the idea that you might type in a flag This can easily be changed Why not let us customize everything about the keyboard Im not talking about the current edit features I mean EVERYTHING That is okay though In time Other then that the phone is flawless I Love You Motorola and Verizon I rate this phone and 98 out of 10 Well worth it Fantastic phone  Smooth to handle  Great pictures  Very thin and I easily moved from an earlier Droid phone PHONE HAS TO MANY SLIDES TO GET AROUND ANSWER PHONE HAS TO MANY SLIDES TO JUST ANSWER PHONE DELETING ALSO HAS TO MANY SLIDES JUST TO DELETE MESSAGES WHEN PHONE RINGS  PHONE ICON SHOWS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAP ICON TO ANSWER DIRECTLY Battery without MOD attached runs down much faster than my previous droid while running same apps Do not like having to us an adapter for earphone would prefer standard plug Projector and camera MODS kinda expensive Water proof I that show and listen to music at the same time Ive dropped this phone more times then I can count the battery life suck The battery suck it dies to quickly This is a great phone I had droid Turbo I was looking for the second generation To find out they stop those I was very scared to get it because of price But so far its been a GREAT phone Pictures are amazing Ill add some The battery life has served as good so far I have had little over a week I work a job that I need to listen to music all day to get though my job I use my phone for that and I work 12 hours or more a day I go home with 30 percentage on my phone I rated it a 4 out of 5 because I still believe its a little high but worth penny I got it because my sister has one and recommended it I value her opinion This is way more than youll ever get againBe happy with what you got This is a great phone and love the Speck cover Note this phone uses USBC connection which is a change from my old phone so had to get all new connectors such as car charger and USBC to USB to connect to laptop and headphones Transition to new phone was super easy Verizon transfers Contacts I just reinstalled Apps Difficult to navigate due to constant pop up notifications Answering the phone was even hard because of this Being that I was coming from a very old Motorola phone to a smart phone it was very intimidating but with a little patience it has became a easy transition  Just remember with so many features it will just take time to learn them all I like the phone however Ive noticed when I make a call it almost sounds like Im in a tunnel Reception is usually good otherwise just something I noticed Also sometimes at the edge of the screen it isnt responsive Like when Im texting and try to touch the letter p on the edge it doesnt register The phone is amazing It has a great camerastorage is large sound quality is great Definitely would recommend to a family member or friend Bluetooth has problems especially in disconnect It disconnects itself and then has trouble finding paired devices I like how the figure print scanner works Its fast and smooth but the battery life terrible The battery mod is 100 needed to get a full day use out of it Great phone hard to get use to the size though
The cases are expensive for the phone but overall like it so far Still a little worried about c type charger connection too flimsy seen too make designs fail ex usb ports on previous models

no ear bud plug really need a pigtail to use not everyone uses bluetooth Ive only had the phone for a week so I still adjusting   On the plus side the phone charges rapidly  On the negative side to answer the phone I have to slide the phone icon to answer  I want to be able to tap answer  

Also it makes too much noise  beeping vibrating etc  Received 50 text messages from the Verizon network in under 24 hours which turned out to be a network problem Had to mute conversation  Could find nothing online so returned to the store  Fix was in progress 

Its a feature rich phone with some annoyances Let me use it for a while and Ill follow up The phone is very fast very reliable high quality and it is capable of doing everything I need it to do I am excited to buy and try all of the new mods Not completely satisfied with my phone I find it hard to get around the different apps The cloud transfer of my contact list didnt transfer right Battery life is not an all day thing The salesman talked me out of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I do regret my decision and its too late to exchange phones by 3 days Its a great phone great quality pictures are awesome its just the battery does not last as long as I was initially told it would I have to put it on the charger 2 to 3 times a day I like how you can transfer modules so easy to your phone and play music on it sound quality is great no more dropped calls and you can here so clearly No doubt the phone is thin and fits into my jacket pocket back slacks or even a shirt pocket super easy  The speed of the processor vs my old Samsung Note 3 is night and day  The screen quality is also vastly better and clear  Not sure if its as good as my 4k TV but sure seems to be  Transfer of all my old data no problem  If there were a gripe I would say that having been used to one way on the Samsung for so long makes doing a transition even tougher but Im getting better at it  Sending pics vs my old method is not as swift but it may again be habit of my old pattern  I simultaneously got a IPHONE 7 when I took a new position with my current employer and it is so much better screen and size for a 54 year old guy  Nice job Motorola  Finally having the extra magnetic accessories to quickly switch to seems exciting  I started with only the excess battery and have already ordered the camera projector and JBL speakers for when Im working or in need of some tunes The phone opens apps very quickly and with the advanced lte the phone responds quickly to anything I open or browse Has a great battery life and i love having the ability to purchase moto modz such as the jbl speaker and the projector attachment which i think would be awsome during watching netflix videos on my phone and the fact that it will connect to the google daydream vr I also enjoy the stylish magnetic back designs i can put on The phones shatterproof display is a huge plus and its camera takes magnificent photos The front flash was a great touch as well The phone needs a different charger than the original android charger which is a small drawback but i presume thats due to the power it takes to recharge this beast The phone also uses a dongle instead of having a headphonr port but i like listening through bluetooth anyways The fingerprint scanner works extremely fast to open and unlock your device I also enjoy having the ability to wave my hand over the phone to turn the screens active display on and check the time and i also enjoy being able to shake the phone to quickly open the flashlight and rotate the phone repeatedly to quickly open the camera The phone also has 2 lights for the phones rear flash and flashlight producing a substancial amout of light making it easy to see in the dark This phone cobnects to my vehicle very easily and plays my music through spotify immidiately where as on my old galaxy s7 it would constantly open up google play music forcing me to close google play music and reopen spotify All this for about the same price as the iphone 7 I recommend this phone to any true android enthusiast as this phone was built powerful and strong I really expected it to at least be as good as my old phone on battery but drains quickly very disappointed Two failed phones in less than a month  On original phone after two weeks blue tooth would not work  Replacement was a refurbished unit  we had paid for new phone just two weeks earlier  The second phone went two weeks also  This time the volume and oneoff buttons quit working altogether  Also the volume could not be controlled be the settings function  We are now waiting for number three  NOT HAPPY I love this phone still working on figuring out to use everything but so far pretty impressed I had the Galaxy S7 and hated it If it were not for the snapon camera I would hate this phone completely Entering a text message every word has missed hit characters Tried to enlarge font in settings and it didnt help at all Having to toggle to another screen to input symbols is a pain Typing in Google search bar sucks I run my business from my phone and the days are very long and unproductive these days Oh and now the Verizon chat box pops up and wants to help me Really Tell Motorola to include an instruction booklet with their overpriced phone Try to find info online forget about it The moto z is really nice and light the mods for it are amazing the speacker is pretty loud for its size and the projector has pretty good quality and the camera is really good quality too charger mod woyld of been good if i could plug it in cause not everyone has wireless charging only thing i did not like about the phone is that for ear plugs its the same as the charging plug The moto z is a okay smartphone but the speaker is weak and the battery doesnt last all do even if you really dont use itI dont know if I should return it before the 14 days and get a iphone 7 plus or just keep it and  deal with it The phone is easy to use very user friendly and anyone could find it very helpful I love the features and what all the phone can and will do I purchase my NEW Motorola MOTO Z in NOvember 2016  It stopped charging 3 weeks ago  it would acknowledge the charger being plugged into the phone  car or home  Tried it in the store  also failed  Returned NEW phone one that I am still making payments on and will continue to do so for over a year and a half and was sent a REFURBISHED Moto  Well three weeks later the REFURBISHED MOTO is once again not charging easily  very erractic  AND the voice commands failing  Verizon has been very unhelpful  I have spent hours on the phone and online with them  i am once again on the phone with them  i am done The battery doesnt hold a charge I usually have to charge it mid afternoon after charging it at night Never had that problem with my iPhone The screen is good size I dont think Id recommend it to anyone Not up to all the hoopla Just OK

Just repeating on purpose to make the 100 character minimum
Not up to all the hoopla Just OK Once I figured out how to access the settings it was easy to set up and use The only problem is the location of the buttons on the upper right side They are right where you want to hold the phone in landscape position No headphone jack Have to take off the case to remove attachments Attachments are difficult to remove Other than that its a great phone Functions excellent and does everything a smart phone should do Good features great battery life Outperformed my old Droid by leaps and bounds Very happy with this purchase Its a little to big for my liking dont like the different plug the first two rings are really low Hard to answer when other apps My wife and I both got these phones After her phone getting HOT and getting it traded out everything is fine Very quick and user friendly The options including the fingerprint scanner are awesome Being able to access the flashlight with the double hatchet motion The camera being accessed by flipping the wrist is awesome Highly recommended for any ones upgrade Its a good phone It has alot of cool things to add to the phone like the camera and speakers I would recommend this phone It is fast screen easy to ready charges quickly and navigation is easy The battery is not any better than my old Droid Turbo which is the main reason I bought a new phone so far the battery sucks and the reception was better in my old phone The battery runs down too quickly When talking to people I hear background static also when the phone is ringing on their end I hear static There is a phone number it doesnt like to connect to Really like the phone only thing Im a little set off by is how many updates Ive had to do in just the first week of having it I thought I was upgrading from my LG G3 but is a down grade the phone is slower some Nice and thin And is a good phone EXCEPT the camera glass is fragile about a month ago I took the phone out of its case and the camera glass was broken I am just now posting because I thought Id try to find a replacement NO Not Verizon nor any after market can get the part I have serious doubts whether I will even own another Motorola phone and am seriously considering leaving Verizon for selling products they cant replace parts Cons Battery doesnt last near what I thought it would Has a tendency to change my ringtonesnotifications for no reason You have to buy a new charger for it so all of the previous android cords I have do me no good There is no spot for head phones or earbuds have to by a special adapter that goes into the charging port therefore you cannot use earbuds and charge the phone at the same time 

Pros It takes really good pictures The new cord can fully charge my phone from 0 in 15 hours Speaker is pretty good Has a thumbprint lock if you wish to use it I was a little skeptical at first but after getting used to the new phone I really liked it more and more  The processor is great and loads everything very fast  I love the MOTO gesture mod and use it to turn my flashlight on at work or to turn the camera on in a flash to capture that quick spur of the moment photo opportunity that sometimes passes you by when trying to get to the camera through the phone interface  I use the phone all day at work and the battery lasts me all day without needing to charge it but to make sure I never have to worry about it I purchased the battery mod for it  The mods are another great feature and turns the phone into many different devices that can enhance the user experience both personal and professional  The fingerprint scanner to turn the phone on works great and  makes it easy to turn the phone on and off  Overall I think that Motorola did a great job on this phone I love the new accerorie speaker for when Im taking showers I dont like taking the speaker outside incase I drop it it because I like it so much but its perfect for my me time in the restroom I purchased the battery pack for special trips but I dont think Ill use it much because I LOVE my new otterbox commuter case so much All around I dont have any negative feedback about the new droid Z So far its my favourite android that has come out so far I hope I can use this phone for years to come Went from a flip phone to the Moto Z DroidVery easy  The Verizon store employee made it simpleCan not imagine an easier conversion I The Motorola Moto Z is very nice and Im very satisfied with itI like it better than the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge I hadGreat on the battery power Ive had two smart phones in the past A Samsung G3 and G4 They would not last very long and I would need a new battery Evey 4 or 5 months Ive had this Moto Z Play for 2 months now and I like it The battery lasts a long time at least 2 days of constant use Streaming music at work using WiFi and Bluetooth for 8 solid hrs with the battery at 85 The G4 would need a recharge at lunch time just sitting there not doing anything The Moto Z Play has a big display too just as big as my wifes Apple 7 pluss The camera is pretty good too It is every bit as good as the Apple in my opinion for half the price Oh yeah There are some cool Doo dads that can snap on to the phone I love how all my pictures automatically back up to the cloud I also enjoy how light weight the phone is Easy to use great high def screen Camera takes great pictures crisp videos Like the extra storage option This phone is easy to understand I went from a Flip phone to this one I had to have wife and granddaughter help me learn but caught on very fastlove all of the features it has  If I could give it  negative stars I would The apps constantly act up and the service and battery life are horrible Thanks Verizon store for recommending such a horrible phone I am pleased with the device itself and am quickly learning the features since I had a earlier version of Motorola I was so grateful everything got transferred so easily from my old phone I was so glad to find a user manual online for some quick answers My husband 17 yr old daughter  I were due for an upgrade We had previously owned 2 galaxy s5s  2 galaxy s4s but 3 out of the 4 of them had quit working entirely I was forced to use an old phone which was the Motorola razor that was pretty old but still worked pretty well even though the screen was smashed so I knew I didnt want another galaxy  that I wanted a Motorola phone since they seemed to be made well I had been thinking about getting the moto z but after my husband compared the Samsung s7  the moto z force he decided on the moto z force so all 3 of us ended up with one I love my phone Its made very well  has many awesome features I plan on buying the camera  projector attachments as well My last motorla served me well I kept it months pass my upgrade date because it was a good product Great Android phone  Love the features and accessories  Really easy and smooth transition from iOs Moto Z is an excellent phone  Good size fairly larg but easily pocketable  I was hoping to get the LG V20  This was my second choice but Im very happy  I like the removable memory but wish it had a removable battery too  Camera seems pretty decent  App performance is great  Call and data performance is great  

Moto mods are a nice idea that could be expanded more  No need for a projector  JBL speaker would be better if it also had a Bluetooth option so it could also be controlled from a distance  Hasselblad camera is a nice idea but even though it has a nice zoom it still has a tiny cell phone sized sensor    That just leaves the covers and batteries   Covers offer no added protection for the phone  While they look cool they do nothing  The battery options sometimes include wireless charging but none have a USBC rapid charging plug  I see a lot of potential with mods but nothing that makes me want to rush out and buy it  

I like the ideas on the LG V20 of keeping a spare battery and charger around and then swapping it when I need it and the separate wide angle camera  The Moto Z however doesnt need to be powered off to add a battery mod or any mod for that matter  The user interface on the Moto Z is great  I havent felt the urge to get custom launchers as I did with previous phones  Overall highly recommend Love the Moto z Brilliant color screen with so much to do The only thing is battery life kind drains way too quick The sales person was very helpful and very courteous  He suggested I add my landline phone which I did and it saved money to do this  I love this phonePerfect size and it works like a charm Speaker arent the best but you can purchase the JBL mod for a reasonable price I was very disappointed in the battery life of this phone  I had to recharge it several times a day  I had a Verizon store look at it and we disabled any apps that could have been draining the battery and I turned off bluetooth wifi while sleeping etc  I switched back to my previous brand I love to use my phone for picture taking So the added memory is nice and it can back them up to Google photos  It also will backup to many other cloud services Im frustrated that there is a Daily System upgrade that makes my phone unavailable for 20 minutes at a time and uses my data to process the upgrade Like the phone and the idea of all that it should do The camera has let me down although I do like the flash on selfie mode Having Bluetooth problems when driving Not so safe I hear a weird noise during phone calls considering getting something different Pros Nice looking phone Sound is great when talking on the phone clear and no trouble hearing the person Im speaking with Doesnt ever cut out or drop calls Takes great photos Overall Im pleased with it 

Cons I dont like that it wakes up constantly and reacts to my every move I really feel like its spying on me Im in the habit now of placing it face down on the table so I dont see it waking up all the time Battery runs out by the end of the day if Im using several apps I use a card reader for my business and plugging it in to the flexible cord adaptor is not the best system for swiping cards I miss the headphone jack I expected it to have more features  to be more advanced especially with the money I spent I VERY much REGRET buying this phone  will NEVER by a Motorola phone again Its a cheap unimpressive phone Im telling everyone NOT to buy one I really like the phone I enjoy being able to wave my hand over the phone and the time pops up The HD voice is so cool It sounds like the person is sitting next to you when youre talking to them I also like the camera It takes really nice pictures Im not so happy with the no headphone jack You have to get Bluetooth headphones if you want to listen to music while your phone is charging I also had to return two of these phones because the battery drained fast So far the third phone I have has a good amount of battery My last phone drained from 100 to 85 in one hour Overall the phone is pretty good other than the battery issue We looked at the Moto Z Droids We have always had the Samsung Galaxies We were hesitant to make the change However the more we looked at the Moto Z the more interested we were So we took the plunge and my husband and I both got the Moto Z  We both love them They are easy to use since we are already used to androids and the clarity of the screen is awesome The size is perfect The phone makes great pictures We got a great deal and also got cases for both phones while we were there We are happy happy happy We love our new phones Easy to use and has great functionality Would recommend the Moto z to all of my friends I dont like that it didnt come with more accessories or that  you cant charge it and listen to music at the same time I dont like that the adapter is an attachment that you need to I decided to update my LG with the Moto Z  My wife has had this phone and found that it was a superior calling tool compared to LG  However because it does not have a hole to insert a jack to a headphones you are to use an adapter that plugs into the jack and that will plug into the same space as the charger

So I purchased a Bluetooth device to bypass the need to block the charger I was unable to pair my new phone with my Lexus Bluetooth and drove my car to the dealership for their assistance  After their nonsuccess for over an hour I drove to the Verizon store for their assistance  Again having no success it was eventually determined that I had received a defective phone  The replacement was quickly paired with my car by Verizon  I had some questions as I struggled with my learning curve on other features such as copycut and paste to the Clipboard that I couldnt find online  But eventually I was able to figure that and other issues I had and it is getting easier to use now My only issue is that the phone does not have an additional  port for the 
headsetear bud only
You have to have an attachment to use head accessories which is included with the package  One port is utilized for all I traded the Google pixel 5 inch in for the Moto Z droid only because of the size of the screen The phone does lag compared to the pixel and lacks a few features such as Google assistant The battery life is not so great but the phone is super slim It was pretty easy to move from the Samsung 4S to Moto Z The only thing I do not like is the size It is too big to put in a pocket The Samsung had a better size The phone is great A definite improvement over my Galaxy S5 I really like the fingerprint scanner The lack of a physical home button took some getting used to Product and Service is ahead of the game Everything you need from homebusinessor personal use at your fingertips exactly as described to me not an over priced phone with a better camera than a samsung  ease of use Upsold this phone and dont care for it Battery life isnt any better than the previous one Not worth it There were a few things that didnt transition smoothly The day after I bought the phone it went through multiple updates I was not expecting this Battery life was aweful but has resolved Email transition was problematic but seems to have resolved itself as well I lost my textsSomehow my wifi was turned off and it has cost me almost all my data two weeks early Not real happy about thatThe store and customer service have been responsive This phone is great  It has a great display and takes excellent pictures  The phone features and controls are excellent  I am very impressed  This is my first droid but wont be my last Easy to use I think it is a bit clunky but otherwise a good phone The screen colors are vibrant and the sound quality is good Im still learning the different features as I go I like the size of the phone I also like the batterys quick charging time So what if theres a family emergency yet theres some outage and the phone cant be used Makes me question the reliability of the service you offer The device is awesome just a little to big Cant fit it in my pocket Battery life is great so far Switching from an phone little challenging at first but now am loving it Love the camera great pictures easier to get apps like the size Too many adds and drop calls never get over three bars nice phone like the sides of it but its not a real Android Excellent phone  Love the clearness of the screen and the brightness it affords Love the features the phone has to offer  Great product Have nothing bad to say about it and would get another one for my wife and daughter and tell everyone to get one This phone works in my metal building which is great  I dont loss service as easy as before And I can answer it without hanging up on the person calling I am not getting as strong a signal as I did with my previous Droid Turbo Messages are getting hug up not delivered Pandora does not work as smoothly as with the previous unit Minor plus  are the thinness of the unit and longer battery life  However I have several chargers in home office and car so it is not that big a plus The instructions are too technical and difficult to understand  The camera is like this question  What do you want add photo add video  My biggest issue is the rejectanswermessage button Its going to take some getting used toas Im used to being able to swap in either direction
I do really like the phonehave gotten asked what phone is THAT I cant believe how fast the Droid ishow responsive it is  I have had Samsung products for years and now You can not pay me to have another Samsung phone
It just wont happen The pixels are betterits so much faster it charges so much faster as well its amazing It is good to have stateoftheart technology at my fingertips Switching from a slidephone to this Droid has been relatively simple The phone works perfectly it is better that Motorola droid turbo that I had I would recommend the Moto Z to a friend This phones sucks bad it slow it keeps making everything on the the phone big like its in zoom all the time takes forever to type in number so like the galaxy better Wasnt sure what to expect and I am still getting used to it Mostly I had to get used to new placement on features I love that the hot spot is not an app anymore but a setting like WiFi or bluetooth It is moving slowly  Need tutorial session  Should offer a session and some staff should be able to answer inquiries and be more accommodating especially to elderly who are trying to keep updated Had it 2 weeks Still cant figure out how to screenshot Other than that everything seems to be OK Does the job very well I use it every day for work Basic functionality nearly mirrors my Samsung g4 I got this phone because I got a good price on it I had a Samsung Note 3 for about 3 years and it was finally starting to get herky jerky on me I like the Note better because everything on it seemed more logical for someone who is not a techie Maybe in a couple of more months I might grow to love this phone but right now we only have a Luke warm relationship The phone was easy to learn how to do things I love the big screen It is also faster than any phone that I have had It also takes beautiful and sharp pictures I dont like the notifications process  Its awkward and requires multiple steps to get to the information which defeats the point of the notification short cuts  Its also particular on the action required to answer the phoneagain the point of the entire product The great fastest way to get any information related to daily basics easy to use and understand SZ I loved my previous LG phone but it just shut down one day When I took it into the Verizon store they had trouble getting into it Then it just rebooted as if a new phone When I said that I needed to be able to rely on the phone because of my job I was handed this Moto Z Droid I wasnt too enthusiastic because I had had an earlier version that had not been a good experience At least I got started quickly but Im not a fan of the keyboard and Im having trouble getting completely connected to my office Outlook especially the Contact list Hard to explain but I miss the phone that crashed My Moto Z Droid seems to be keeping a charge longer than my previous phone  I also like how thin and lightweight it is I need to upgrade and since I drive with a ride share company now was the time I can switch between both apps in the split screen mode Love this feature Keep me current with surges and prime time Love love love my Moto Z Droid First smart phone and love how easy it is to use
The camera is good also 
Just love this phone Great deal and so glad I bought it I have had this phone since August of this year and so far I am on my 3rd replacement Each phone has corrupted more then one SD card and with each one once the corrupting of the memory card happens thats when it all of a sudden the phone will not ring no notifications go off no alarms Nothing Verizon and Motorola have been no help what so ever besides lets try yet another factory reset lets try clearing your cache for the ten millionth time O OK lets send u out another replacement So now I am stuck with this phone for almost 2 years I am paying all this money for a phone that has never worked properly due to no fault of my own and apparently its never going to work properly You would think Verizon would care more about their customers satisfaction and provide them with phones that actually work or at least try to give them more options when it comes to that same issue with 3 of the same phones in less then 6 months Situations like this they should make an exception and allow the customers to switch to another device under warranty Not asking for ya know a newer high end phone I would rather have a downgraded phone that actually does what it supposed to then deal with one that doesnt Very fast phone and the battery last for days Love compare to other phone This phone is much bigger which is a good things Last phone I had I had to take Apps off because it was to slow but this phone is 32g Love it The best phone I have ever owned Will stick with this product cause I trust it and trust in a product these days is so hard to come by When my Moto G3 which is an old model ran out of room I went straight for another Motorola phone Thanks Motorola I bought one Moto Z Play for me and one for my brother and I tell everyone about its features Just upgraded my phone other one was old and would not hold a charge all day  My new Moto Z has speaker problems it has crackling and you can not hear  Verizon rep has ordered me a new one  Taking more of my time to go back and get the new phone  Phone somes with several apps that I will never use  Wish I could pick which apps I want This phone has the worst battery life of any phone Ive ever used  If you only use your phone for calls and text messages the battery life is fine but if thats the case you dont really need a smart phone  If youre using features that justify having a smart phone the battery life is not going to be sufficient I was set on getting the Galaxy S7 as my upgrade from my S5 which was an upgrade from the S3 Loved my Galaxys  After seeing this phone and doing the research I decided to go with it instead Ive been very happy with the choice Great phone for the price So far I am happy with all its features And I love how big the screen is I am able to read my text messages with no problems Took away many simpler features that my Samsung 5 phone had had a better speed dial feature better way to figure out the phone better photo gallery cannot figure out how to use my external SD card instead of one step things take 2 or sometimes 3 steps Snapfish doesnt recognize the pictures from my phone only the whats app ones Took a long time for the video feature to get a clear pictureHad to press the button countless times I hate this phone only like big screen I cant upload my pics only download not able charge and lusten to headset is not obtion unless you have wireless Still learning how to use features that differ from my old Samsung S4  I need to add thirty characters to make this an acceptable review  Stupid I like the phone but the volume for me is to low and seem to have less ring tones choices Didnt take me long to get use to it Miss several features of the galaxy s4 such as keyboard shortcut from camera to gallery Battery life about the same as my galaxys4 extended life battery After I heard the advertising for the Moto Z Droid I took my granddaughter with me to check it out  We were so impressed she got one too Moved to Verizon after a long time with ATT Very happy so far with coverage Love my new Moto Droid Z Still playing with all the features but love Android I like the new Moto Z droid alot I switched from the Moto X 2nd Gen I like the fingerprint option the best it speeds up getting into the phoneTalking sure seems a lot clearer on this phone than the Moto X also I guess time will tell if holds up Absolutely love the Moto Z Droid battery lasts a long time lots of storage just a great phone all together The Moto Z droid is amazing It exceeds all of my expectations it really is a mini computer in my hands The camera quality is wonderful and I can multitask with multiple apps running at once with no problem in performance Only draw back is the battery life but if you keep apps closed then that helps Phone syncs with my spouses  dont care for that  Wish that could be kept separate otherwise its okay I havent had a cellphone in 15 years so this is my first one  I didnt have any problems getting it working and using it right away  Im very happy with it I have had several Motorola phones in the past that is why I chose the Moto Z It was an easy transition since I knew the brand well Great features great cameraSound is goodLooks and feels great
Droid is Z greatest phone so far Better than that fruit phone Lol Challenging to find correct texting and voicemail apps Pre installed apps want to charge a service fee to use Camera functions slow Most base phone apps dont have settings in app to customize Size is a little large for my hand Calls sound tinny i like the speed of the phone battery life is good i feel it could use more storage space or to be able to use the SD better idk over all A I bought this phone because of the price  The fast processing is fine It runs my business Apps that I need to have  I HATE that I cannot transfer my music as easily as I did on my Samsung  I STILL DO NOT have a way to play the music  I have to download an App to  do that  Samsung provided an available app  Also HATE the phone does not come USB connector ready or have a builtin ear phone jack Fantastic graphicsflash for camera is much better than my previous phone Easy to set up and transfer data Love how fast it charges Love the camera and figuring most things out Not used to it yet n lost in some areas All n all its a nice phone A bit of a learning curve for seniors but overall a great product A bit large for old hands but best size of new designs available 
Camera is awesome and Moto Z Droid addons are wonderful There were a few things that took some getting used to but overall very similar to my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 As Im now used to it I like it quite a bit  The screen is really large but the width dimension is similar to my older phone so it still fits into pockets that the old one fit into There have been almost daily system updates which is getting old but Im sure that will eventually end It is an improvement over my old phone which was a good phone Switch from iPhone to Android  very happy  size of phone makes it easy to read  like touch screen where you can preview messages  Sound quality when talking on the phone much improved The phone is amazing but idk it keeps turning on and off same thing with the speakers but other than that the phone is amazing I love it I had an iPhone I dont think I would go back to the Iphone any time soon i love my moto This phone is fast and easily programmable It is very thin and light weight With the expandability of the clip on options this phone can do so much more This phone is pretty niceSo far I like it I love the service the price and overall experience with Verizon The only problem Ive noticed about this phone is its tendency to drop its WiFi connection Other than that Im very pleased A great phone The Motorola Droid and Android system are keeping up with the times and providing a competitive choice for the Apple products which the rest of my family prefer   

The Moto Force upgrade was offered at a special halfprice now apparently being reduced even further so that made the move a smart one on my part

Something is always lost in the transition and it took me a few days to bring my new phone up to the comfort level of my old one downloading the dozens of apps that did not get delivered from the cloud during the activation and learning on my own how to transfer the ringtones from my old phone via a bluetooth connection 

Now the phone seems to be working well perhaps a little faster than the old one with sharper videos and photos The bothersome promotions for Verizon addons and other products are about to end so I can settle into just using the phone As a new user of a smartphone it is a little overwhelming and We do not have our grandkids to help us  We are slowly overcoming all the phones capabilities Most of my apps timeout after 5 minutes  Amazon Musicetc Always in driving mode cannot answer phone always updating The Moto z droid is my new favorite phone The graphics on it are amazing in every game It also has great speed in its processing so that it doesnt hang up on random apps The bonus to all of it is the attachments that you can get I cant wait to get my projector I have heard nothing but good things no instructions and everything is different than my old droid max having a very hardtime trying to figure out how to do the basic functions I love how the phone runs with no problems whatsoever  I will be getting my wife the same phone because of how much I enjoy mine Camera isnt the best I dont like that there isnt a home button Also not a fan of gold but they were out of black I like the screen size Once learned how to use this phone is  pretty easy to manage Down side is no head phone jack for ear buds have to Bluetooth or use cable provided Ive always had Motorola but this phone by far is the worst The battery may charge fast but who cares when it sucks the life out of battery just as fast Cant have all the apps on this phone like other phones Ive had Cant turn the text notification down because its same volume as ringer not separate First day I had to do a factory reset Should have gone to an iPhone as much as I am against it Motorola going downhill New phone seems okay but the gallery doesnt work like my last Moto and the photos dont send in normal texts and then my phone is sending messages only sometimes most stay in que and never are delivered Bummer I dont likee that Facebook or whoever beeps every time there is an announcement  Dont know how to cancel the beeps  Will get help when I see my grandson Overall Im very happy with my new phone I prefer androids and this model fits my needs and wants Cant be used as a remote control and it doesnt a preinstalled voice recorder Refer a calculator like the one in the LG3 Okay besides that its a phone Love this phone the advancement s that come with this phone are great and I love how u can change the phone the way u like Still learning how to use it  My grandchildren are very helpful in teaching me  So far I am enjoying the learning how to use all the feat This phone is very light and thin but has a large screen that is great for watching videos or reading Easy to recommend Great service phone works great people was friendly they did everything help change over from Sprint thanks My Turbo 2 took a bath and I was gonna get another but couldnt find one Was told this was comparable Totally not No wireless charging and very touchy keypad Not happy It has been easy to get use to I still havent learned everything about the phone yet The only thing I didnt like is it didnt come with accessories like the camera or speaker or a phone charger Come with no instructins and does not acess features like other previous systems have No speed dial unless you count toughing a recent call as speed dial Does not come with Message app and the contact feature is totally messed up No ease of access I like the Z but Im hoping with time I will love it Some issues the arose since I bought it continuous system updates sometimes more than once in a day some apps wont work that did work on previous smart phone closing applications via the small square at the bottom of the screen until the most recent update number 6 or 7 now I had to swipe every single app to closeend it but now it offers the close all option at the top I do wish I had the option for a smart case but that is probably being petty

Pros I very much like the fingerprint lockunlock love the option for mods I havent used one yet but plan to camera takes beautiful pictures and sound clarity is superior 

I did speak to a technician about the continuous updates and they recommended taking it back and getting a replacement this was the third day I had it but I havent had a chance yet Today is day 10 and the system updates have slowed down but still some technical issues from time to time Other than that I am very glad I chose the Z droid Use my phone primarily for business and it meets or exceeds all requirements This is my 6th or 7th smartphone and nothing I have had even begins to compare My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy 4 This phone is much larger and utilizes the new USB C connection  charging unit so all of my cables from the past dont work anymore and I find that aggravating Finally there is no headphone jack and this trend of having to go to wireless earbuds is I also find bothersome All of this being said the phone itself delivers as it was advertised Great price I really like that I can add a memory card couldnt in the turbo Moto Z does way to many updates though I had it a week and it did 5 system updates Battery life isnt as long as the Turbo either It is a great size and wide viewing screen Overall it is a good phone data useage  used up to fast I like the size and it is easy to use sound is very good very clear no problems with this phone yet Overall a very fine phonenot enough battery storageseems to be very durableno issues so far  been a year a little spendy Easy transition Easy to sync with my car and to get back on line with email and Facebook Love the new red case It would be helpful if it had a builtin Notepad capability of assigning different notification tones for contacts social media and emailas of now notifications are all the same toneI have to check my phone each time it goes off to see what it is Also would like a port to plug in headphones that I dont need a converter too many updates everyday is ridiculous plus too many apps that I dont want or will use guy at Verizon when I went back was very condescending to me and didnt get all my answers If using an app very hard to answer phone screen keeps changing I am in a learning curve This is my first smart phone so Im learning how to text and all the other features the phone has to offer I am a little hard of hearing and the sounds even turned up to max is a some what softIm trying to find out if it has a feature that the phone lights up to signal an incoming call  text or email so far no luck Ive only had it for a week or so but it is still a work in progress I have not used the camera yet and I hope it is great as it was one of the main reasons I went to the smart phone There is not a cord to connect the phone to my computer  What a misstep by design  When changing things make them better  I cant use my ear phones and recharge the phone at the same time  Why  When transferring from one phone to another it screws up too many things  Just transfer what is on the phone and dont try to be cutsie I do like this phone better than my previous phone but not every change is an  improvement  Remember that not everyone is a techy and not everyone wants changes just to impress everyone that they can change the programs  Have had major problems with the length of the charge of the battery Great phone except it will not let you answer 12 of the calls goes to message also one day it would not charge until it completely ran down Weve been Verizon customers for over 15 years The service has always been reliable and customer service very good Dont like locked front screen Tried to look up on how to get that off and cant find the answer Battery life is barely a day Learning where to find information Unhappy with the charging cord Standard battery drains quickly on standby and worse after 2 phone calls The ear speaker sound is terrible during phone calls Overall temperature is hot when in a pocket Some apps simply disappear Love my new phone This is my 3rd Motorola Droid and couldnt be happier One draw back about the phone it does ring very loud Even with ringer up all the way is not loud Some might call that a plus though Nice phone so far but has a vibration when listening on the phone Battery life seems lots shorter than the Droid Turbo I had Easy to use Great screen size Good battery life Needs a battery charge after 36 hours or so Love the updates after purchase Really made the phone work so much better Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life  Long battery life The Moto Z has great features and it was easy to transfer the settings and data from my old phone  When I needed to contact the Chat Room prior to ordering the phone they were extremely helpful in answering my questions The transition from the Galaxy S4 to the Moto Droid Z has been challenging even though they both are Android devices it iok why should I the thing will never change I like to have chargers all over not take the same one all the time My biggest complaint is the size Its way too big just like the rest of them I might as well hold my tablet up to my ear The battery drains quickly and the charger is a joke I cant use the charger in my car because the plug doesnt disconnect from a USB cable so I cant plug it into my cars USB port to charge which is necessary given the horrible battery life The charger isnt travel friendly either because the prongs dont fold into itself to keep it from jabbing into everything in my bag Near as I can tell they dont even make a car charger for this phone It seems technology is moving backwards The phone is easy to use and maneuver through  Any questions you van find right on the phone Takes great pictures and videos Its a good phone but I miss the old phone that was 4 years old and also a droid I dont think its a lot of difference between them I had Iphone 5 and Samsung Note and Galaxy This Moto Z is the best phone I ever had Tin  powerful I like the phone quite a bit Still taking a while to get used to where everything is I quite like the feature of double flipping or double shaking to get some features to come Especially the flashlight The customer service really help me they were very helpful and friendly Really helpful Had all the answers to my question I love the phone I just do not understand why the notification volume is tied into the volume I had to block most of mine to have my volume up full Enjoyed getting back to the moto from a Samsung Galaxy All the great things I lovedo about the moto x plus the projector that can be attached to the back battery pack and more Phones screen constantly turns on when something get near it and kills the battery Did not realize there was no head phone jack Speaker mod isnot loud enough to for anything The phone is great The screen is large and the high definition looks like its high definition However the first time I dropped the phone the screen cracked The sales agent told me it was shatter resistant When I took it back to the sales agent he was incredibly surprised The phone charges fast and the battery seems to drain fast Upgraded to the Z since I had the X Smooth transition as the software is pretty much the same The size is the only bad thing It is 55 inches and stretches the thumb muscles when holding it The X was the perfect size Also do not like that there is no holster with a clip on it for this phone I use the Map My Walk app and clipping my phone to a pocket was perfect Over all a good phone and will not be returning it This phone is great it has great features design  Light weight  Easy to use  I am very pleased w this phone  Wish I could have purchased sooner I bought this a few days before Christmas when the charger port quit workingThe young man who helped me was very knowledgeable and helped me get a phone as similar to my onld phone as possible Not too thrilled with this phone 
Wish my old Samsung note 4 had benn more waterproof 
And this is too expensive Email links do not forward or open tab to link Still trying it out Battery life is only a little over 12 hours not the advertised 40 not any better than my old phone May not keep it based on above Havent had this phone very long but its already my favorite By far the fastest phone I have ever used The battery life is amazing no longer have to carry a phone charger on me at all times The screen is the perfect size takes great pictures I havent had the chance to use any of the Moto Mods yet but the phone by itself is perfect I got two of these and both have miserable battery life which was the primary reason I was upgrading from phones my wife and I have had for many years  With absolutely no usage the battery loses its charge completely in less than a day Wanted a good phone with good service and was told this phone had dual antennas and was excellent for the area I lived in That is a joke continually have lost calls or can not make a call I will say that camera is about the only thing on phone that has been true to its word Im still learning all of the features on my phone but really enjoy the larger screen and the ease of going from one app to the next Im really glad I decided to upgrade This phone is great except for the fact that the LCD breaks if you look at it wrong Ive had my phone since august and since then I have had to replace the LCD 4 times One of those times was my fault I dropped my phone that one time but the other 3 Ive just woken up and the screen wasnt functional Also I am extremely unhappy with Motorolas customer service They have lost me as a customer If you do get this phone do yourself a favor and get the insurance plan with Verizon so that you DONT have to deal with Motorola This phone is great but I noticed the touch screen isnt always that sensitive Sometimes I have to tap something several times for it to work Also there have been a few occasions where the screen acts funny It will oscillate rapidly between a couple different displays like its malfunctioning I got this phone dec 23rd and I am about to say officially I hate it It keeps freezing and my Bluetooth will not connect or work with anything I got it because I was told it was the most durable Considering how many times the back has popped off I really dont consider this phone durable And the battery has to be charged at least twice a day which is very unexpected for me considering I use this phone less than the Turbo I replaced  barely charged it once a day I also dont like the size its too big I have had about a week The only thing I dont like is the text messaging The ring tone only plays a few bars of the tone I like the size of the phone and the camera but the battery doesnt always charge properly It will be plugged in but does not read the original charger I also do not like the fact the charging cord is an actual plug not adapter and cord like other phonesmakes traveling with in car airplanes etc a hassle This phone is a little more complex for me than my Moto Y so its been slower to use for me  The original phone I received had to be returned to Verizon after an update left it in a bootloader loop Its a perfectly nice phone It functions as expected I like that it has 4gb of ram But whats missing is a bit in note pad music player and photo gallery I have to get these through Google Play store and they all come with ads Very annoying Have had problems with this phone since I got it First people couldnt hear me when I called them or when they called me  Then the touch buttons wouldnt work Then I couldnt hear people when on blue tooth  Tried to return it but it was too late  Got it at Best Buy  They did not match Verizons extended return holiday policyI had been told they did but Verizon was wrong because when I tried to return it to Best Buy they said only 14 days on cell phones period  I will never buy another phone from Best Buy again I am stuck with this phone for 2 years I bought this phone over two months ago It a birthday gift to myself Best decision ever  Love the ease of use and the battery life is phenomenal Everything you could want in a phone For all the hype smart phones get I expected a lot more when I purchased my first one  My Yahoo email is not compatible with the Android operating system  And speaking of the OS I get almostdaily system upgrades that shut down my phone for up to half an hour  Every time I turn around the phone is asking me to track my location which is very distracting and unnecessary  So far the only application I have downloaded is Facebook and the newsfeed is horrendously fragmented  It doesnt work anything like the regular web site  I dont know if this is due to the Android OS or the application but either way its not very friendly This phone is way too Googled for me to enjoy  Third auto update locked it up with Moto voice error which I dont use  Had to factory reset  No photo gallery wants them on Google cloud apparently  And Google search  bar cannot taken off every page  Beyond intrusive do that many people want the photos stored off their phones  Do that many people not feel like idiots talking to inanimate objects to operate them  Using what little free time I have trying to learn how to go back to how my droid x operated Im glad my previous phone an LG G3 bit the dust  Ive been looking for a valid reason to get a new fancy phone Ive had my Moto Z Droid for a week and Im loving it It is very slim fast looks cool and has a gorgeous screen I bought the JBL speaker mod which sounds decent and works well Im considering getting the zoom camera mod next  The turbo battery charger is super fast The phone is fast and has nice features but its too big to fit in to any pocket and I hate that it does not have a headphone jack Honestly Thinking of returning it I have been using the Moto Z for about 3 weeks now I got it as a replacement for my first gen Moto X First this phone is huge Unlike the Moto X which had a gorgeous handfitting form factor this thing is big and flat I wasnt sure if I was going to keep it for that reason it doesnt fit in any pocket and is hard to dial with one hand I decided to give it a trial though because I do love Moto and really didnt want an iPhone or Samsung So I nicknamed it Toast since it is like talking on a piece of toast Day 1 I drive to work and when it wouldnt fit in cup holder I put it in another slot near me First time I hit the brakes Giant phone flies out of the slot on to the floor I am aggravatedToast was toast I was going to return it at the very next opportunity But as I continued to use it that day we continued to bond its large screen a gift to my presbyopic eyes the wristtwist camera feature I cant live without and how it talks to me while I am drivingWell it was hard to figure out just what phone I would trade it in for if I did return it I could go back to Moto X small but after a few weeks with my new friend Id have a hard time with those tiny little icons Bottom line I decided to keep it and BTW LOVE my red Incipio Dualpro case which gives it a slightly metallic space age look I hope that Moto comes out with a slightly smaller phone soon and that will be a happy medium Until then a toast to Toast I got this when I needed to quickly replace the Turbo1 I had dropped and the display separated from the screen but the glass didnt crack I need something durable and this was suggested by the salesman I dont like that its larger than the phone I had  But more than that I HATE that the back keeps coming off Ive already nearly lost it at least 3 times The only reason to get this phone is if youll use the Mods frequently I also dont like the fingerprint reader I like the idea of it but like many other people I keep trying to use it to get to the home screen In this day of multipurpose its stupid to have a button only exist for 1 reason especially when people might not even use the feature I bought this phone after my Droid Turbo screen was seriously damaged since it was basically a newer version of the same phone  So far I am disappointed as the battery doesnt last very long and nearly every day it is requiring a 20 min update  Also despite being just another Motorola Droid style phone it requires a different charger than my Droid Turbo so now I will have the additional cost of buying another car charger and charger to leave at work  Other than that it is basically the same phone with a few different features or slight variance to the looks of the old Turbo Battery drains fast Even took it back to the Verizon kiosk and he suggested turning battery saver on turn off Bluetooth and location It still drained down Its fully charged when I go to work and I dont even use it until I go to lunch By then its usually about 30 left If it continues I will want an exchange The phone is nice and works good but its hard getting over the notifications not being loud at all  Its set at highest volume and sounds like my old phones lowest volume  Texts come through and I never hear them  Frustrating and may have to leave this phone it is easy phone to use 4th Droid Ive owned and this by far has the worst batter life of them all  It barely lasts a full day and that is with little use  Only bright side is it charges fully in about an hour Much easier to find in my purse keyboard for texting is better than my old phone So its a pretty sweet phone I gotta admit But the battery life is horrible If I do anything Ill have to charge it every hour and a half to two hours which is ridiculous I dont even think itll last a full day without a charge Tried to download pictures and only half of them downloaded  The camera takes more than one shot at a time  When talking to others phone sounds fuzzy Just got it from a flip phone easy to use Had a week now and just love it I bought the Moto Z phone right about 1 week ago I love the camera and the video which I had told the guys at the store were most important to me I also like how sensitive the screen is and the movement features

 I do not like some of the messaging features The keyboard is not as easy to use as the Galaxy I had before I also liked the short cuts better for messaging favorites on my Galaxy Bought this phone under duress after my Droid Turbo took a bath Hate the fact that the chargers are not universal so had to get new ones Battery life is shorter than my Turbo was The only real plus is that it is lighter weight Overall a good phone Read a few reviews about the Moto Z all very good so I decided to make the change from my prior trend of Galaxy S phones to Motorola Took a little adjustment to get use to some functional differences but overall very happy with my decision Great camera quick processoperation slim size with a very nice 55 screen I would and have recommend this phone to friends I just went from an IPhone to the moto z  I thought it would take some adjustment  Wrong no problem using the new phone  Easy easy easy  I found an otter box cover and screen saver for it and now Im all set Go anywhere do anything Enjoy phone just the direction are hard to understand for certain functions have been back to store several times for help which the store was very helpful Have only had this phone for a week but Im very happy with it so far First phone when I bought it only lasted 4 days and locked up and would not factory reset so had to exchange for new one So far this one is ok Was on Iphone 5s platfotm for a job and changed employment Had an LG lucid 2 I was going to activate to establish a new  for myself The associate at the Verizon store showed me the special going for Christmas and the difference in monthly expenses was 11 dollars more than originally budgeted So glad I upgraded Learning the Android based phone is still ongoing but I do like the phone overall Hello Moto I thought the battery would last longer The MotoZ Droid phone is excellent better than my old Moto Droid One thing I would mention though is that the Moto Z doesnt seem to keep the battery power quite as long as the old Moto Droid It may be because I play many games on it which I didnt play on the old Moto Droid I am very happy that I bought it Happy with the new phone can play with settings Easy transition all material transferred Its a nice phone Bigger screen Great pictures Have had phone 1 week and it has done 3 updates 
Phone is also very slick I would suggest getting a case same day as buying phone Bought this to replace Droid Maxx and was super easy to transition Cell phone is nice enough but a battery hog Screen brightness is less than my 2 year old Moto G Moto actions are nice Ive had this my FIRST EVER Smartphone for 10 days now I dont understand the big deal By the time I get to the correct screen to do what I need to do I could have performed the task THREE times already with my basic flip phone All  I have to do is breathe by the phone and it changes screens I dont like it I love this phone  Its very fast its powerful it doesnt come with a lot of unwanted programs that you cant uninstall  The modular components are just icing on the cake since the phone can really stand along without them  I got the battery pack mod and I really like how it can be setup to float the main battery at 80  It lasts really long that way  I dont have a case on the phone right now and Ive dropped it a few times without any damage  Seems to be very well made and sturdy  The screen resolution is pretty amazing all my photos and games look incredible it was an easy move from my Motorola Maxx to my new Motorola Z Moto I love the new phone and its security features are awesome something I didnt have before  I feel more secure with this phone than any in the past and there have been many  I have had three Motorola phone over the past 22 years and feel they are the best cell phones Ive had This was a gift to replace an LG phone on its last legs Between the Google account restore process and the Verizon Cloud backup it was pretty easy to get all the contacts SMS messages phone call history and media moved to the new phone So far its great bigger screen better camera and a much better telephone some smartphones are pretty good computers but not much as far a  phone goes The Moto phones are pretty solid i wish it had features like the samsung S6 its not user friendly as my s6 was miss it Great Phone transferring data from my previous phone was a pain it was so much better the time before I lost so much data Very difficult to pair with the head phones Love MB I waited to buy a new phone and Im so glad I got the Moto Z Droid It is sleek and so efficient The battery life is amazing I charged it to 100 about 10 am on Friday left work in vegas about noon used the navigation on and off during my drive to LA and made a few phone calls and I didnt even reach below 20 when I charged it it the next morning at 10 am I really like it nice big screen and very fast and love that the battery stays charged along time Transition was cool from my Moto X and the Nugget software updated shortly after purchase seem to lost some of my battery life from original purchase date so have to configure my apps and data usage to get back to normal battery usage but other than that all working well so far My old phone had died on me and I paid off my old phone to get this new one  I am very pleased with this phone Perfect phone for me Love it I bought the Moto Z about a week ago I love it Great phones with really nice features Still trying to figure out the Photos but overall pleased I have used Droid phones for years and was looking forward to upgrading my line with another and opted for the Moto Z  I knew it was going to be a good phone because Ive always had good luck with Moto but this one is far better than Id hoped for  The battery life is the best Ive ever had in a smart phone but the real eye opener was the call quality  Ive had people ask if Id gotten a new phone because the call quality was clear and strong  From my end the earpiece is excellent and I have moderate tinnitus  The processor is strong and responses from apps are very quick  The screen is large and easy to see touch is sharp and responsive and the case is thin so it doesnt feel like Im carrying a brick or a potato  Overall the phone is very intuitive and easy to use  Ive been carrying mobile phones for twentyfive years and this is probably the best Ive had I wouldnt recommend Short learning curveYAY
NO HEADPHONES JACKBOOO Wasnt sure how Id like it but so far Im loving it Great display fast and powerful extra storage good camera Only problems I can see is the lack of a headphone jack which I can learn to live without Ive tried an adapter off Amazon and it works so Ill just need to keep a few spares around Only other issue is the inability to rearrange the navigation buttons like I could on my LG I wish Google would get with the program on that its an easy fix The second day l had the phone the camera stopped working and asked me to restart the camera app This appears to be an existing problem with this phone which does not yet have a good diagnosis or answer I had to do a complete factory reset to get access to the camera again Im currently hanging onto my old phone in case I have to return the new one I also had difficulties backing up my old phone onto my new one but thats probably mostly on me Ill try to return and edit this as I learn more Bought just over a week ago can finally update my apps and see what Ive been missing Battery life isnt as great as I wish it would be but still ALOT better than my old phone Everything I expected and then some Very fast Much better than my last phone Battery lasts days Lots of features to learn I HAVE VOLUME AT 100 AND STILL CANNOT HEAR THE PHONE RING OR NOTIFICATION ALERT IF I AM DO NOT HAVE THE PHONE RIGHT NEXT TO ME I always went with HTC but have not been impressed with the last two generations I loved my HTC Maxx but it was starting to finally mess up I was looking at the Google phone as it is manufactured by HTC but ultimately decided on the Moto Z droid I have never had a motorola phone but it is made by Lenovo which made me decide to go with it instead of the Samsung It is a great phone extra slim design fast charging super clear photos and functionality is so easy I got the Moto Z Droid Play for my daughter lets see how she likes after she opens it tomorrow I have had the phone for a week Its no Samsung thats for sure For 999 a month and with the mods I am still happy With the battery mod with 3000 mAh battery you can 
play 8 hours straight Projecter is pretty cool on battery power about 25 hours plugged in watch forever JBL speakers are cool 10 battery life again plugged in forever All in all the motto z is a cool phone with all the mods Really like it works great phone calls are clear battery lasts more than all day So just have the speaker mode looking forward to the next new modes in the near future Bought two of the Moto Z Droid is mostly what I need but wish had bought the Moto Z Force The worst thing that they need are better and more selection of cases etc Let me tell you I have a moto z that I liked a couple months back when I got it That is no longer the case and wish I had never gotten a moto phone This phone is now locking up What do I mean It freezes The screen will stay black even with the phone on And if it does light up its covered in these weird colored streaked lines that cover the whole screen Its like this right now It might come back and work for a little while correctly like it has before when it done this but who knows and if it does for how long This truly is the WORST phone I have ever had in my life It is nothing but a expensive paper weight to me now Really like the phone I was hoping for more advanced features at this point in the game but it is a good replacement for my droid maxx which I was used to  Very similar but I wish they would have kept the same messaging system I went to the Verizon store to get a new Samsung but the salesperson said that they did not carry many Samsung phones because of the recent bad publicity I said that I just wanted a phone Then the salesperson said that the Moto was superior to the Samsung I think the Moto is competitive but not superior For example if you want to make a long telephone call you cannot use your earphones because they use the same port USB C as the charger cable Also you cannot use earphones without an adapter cable I still have figured out how to save pictures and music Must I buy another cable The charger is one piece I cannot disconnect the plug and attach the cable to my laptop The Moto is not a cell phone It is a portable computer with telephone capabilities I go through more steps before I can actually key in a telephone number than with the Samsung Motorola must be providing rebates to Verizon that Samsung does not provide But this phone 4 days ago awful battery life love every feature about the phone except for that Ive had this phone for a little over a week now with no issues My only thing I dislike about it is that it doesnt have a headphone jack and has to have an adaptor for it in the charging port Its kind of annoying Other than that I love the camera it takes amazing quality pictures Very cyberpunk with the mods on it but that being said these are not the selling point of the phone It is good without them but they do add to its versatility and overall life thanks to each mod having its own chargeable battery I love the picture weight and size of this phone as it fits me and I am not one to carry a portable tablet as many people are prone to do nowadays this phone is easy to use and has a great camera Ive had phones since the days of bag phones and all I can say about the Moto is just DONT I experienced 5 days of pure frustration until I could get to Verizon to exchange for the iPhone 6s Phone wouldnt activate out of the box refused to allow access to the cloud attempted for 4 days straight to install a Moto upgrade 29 hours to download notice and it never did  refused to recognize any wireless and would churn and churn and churn attempting the simplest applications After 7 total hours on the phone with tech support I gave up Battery life never lasted longer than 3 hours and I would literally watch the percentage drain before my eyes with limited to no use Worst piece of garbage ever invented plus it would get HOT within minutes of use With so many other options available find one Epic fail Droid very happy with this phone works great ezelent features Cannot hear ring or notification  Sound very very low Love itW Orks great Much faster than my old moto x Changed from iPhone to moto z because I liked the option of being able to use a micro SD card to increase my storage capability  Yes the learning curve was amazing  Still learning after 2 weeks  Over all the phone is great  Its fast and intuitive  Waiting for an update that will fix a notification alert volume issue Not sorry I have this phone The moto Z provides you with the thinnest form factor while still providing great battery life and performance  I love the form factor with the moto mods that give you the option of creating a phone that is truly unique and one of a kind  Great phone Very good service would recommend I changed a couple of weeks ago Doing alright Few changes I have this phone for about two weeks Have always liked the Motorola droid phones since they have the best battery life that Ive ever seen I can go 23 days without charging And the Moto mods are super cool I have the JBL speaker mod and it is great Love that the glass is shatterproof too Had for a week good features nice size Expandable I bought this phone a few weeks ago and this phone is awesome Like the phone not the price but so far its better that the LG4 I hadit was a piece of dung Bought two a few days ago and very happy  There are some drawbacks such as the phone being so large you cannot use it with one hand Also no headphone jack Another thing the USB port is different from other Android phones  Its such an awesome phone we can overcome these challenges I transitioned from an iphone and fine this phone much easier to operate Very thin and light weight Ive had it a couple weeks Battery drains quickly and touch screen is intermittent Not 100 happy And a great dealthanks phone is really big and will not git in a standard jean pocket no headphone jack so you have to purchase wireless headphones to listen to music not user friendly especially when trying to operate the phone with one hand love my phone never lags and the battery power is great no complaints so glad I made the switch The Moto Z Droid is a fabulous phone and it rocks on Verizons service  Im impressed with the speed of the network  Im getting up to 65 Mbps download speeds on this phone  Wow

The phone is very responsive and fast in everything it does ie loading apps webpages etc  It seems that apps just snap to the forefront when loading  I dont see the lag Ive gotten in the past

Battery life  That was my concern because the Moto Z has so much less battery life than its brethren the Moto Z Force and Moto Z Play  At 2600 mahr  it is lasting me the whole day most every day  I keep the quick charger in my office on my desk  I rarely have used it to top off and tend to have at least 60 remaining at the end of my work day  I have been using the phone more than I ordinarily might because its new and Ive been taking time to set it up the way I like it

I also bought a couple of battery mods so if its every an issue because I have to drop everything and run I have the Incipio slim 2200 mah battery mod and the bigger 3000 mah Mod from Mophie  With that on hand anyone should be able to get through a whole day with the heaviest use

The phone looks good and my son loves the thinness  He marveled at how much thinner it is than his Apple 7 plus  I bought my wife one the same day and her workmates are remarking how classy the device looks  Hers is wrapped in the Kate Spade case for protection but it really looks great on the phone

I hope this helps those of you trying to make a decision  I really like the phone a lot  Its as close to plain android as you can get without going to the Google Pixel or a Nexus  Matter of fact I received the latest update to Android 7  Noughat within days of purchase  I recevied Android 7 before the Nexus phones received theres from Google  Amazing Great phone easy to use I used to have a Samsung 6 but now have the Moto and it was an easy transition However one thing I do not like is that it is necessary to have an adapter to plug in headphones as there is no headphone jack Since I started buying smartphones I have always bought Motorola Androids Theyre the best phones in my opinion and the Moto Z is definitely the best one so far I am pretty sure mine has a glitch the speaker takes awhile to send sound out 1 in 5 calls I cant hear unless they call When I am watching a video I have to go into settings to turn the volume down The volume down button on the side just turns my phone volume down not the video volume Great phone good features great feel and size  Not flimsy and very responsive  Google Now is driving me crazy  It responds to external voices like during the National Anthem at ballgame conversation with my wife etc  Then when you want it to work it will not respond Now that Ive used the Motorola PreLock Screen I dont know that I could go back to another phone Its so much faster to play and pause my music or to quickly read my messages

Being able to quickly turn on my flashlight or camera by merely moving the device has proven immensely useful again Im not sure how I could go back to another phone without this ease of access

I got the JBL Speaker mod it sounds great gets mega loud and sweetens the pot that much more On top of that its really snappy and the only non pixel group of phones to support Google Daydream as of writing 12062016 I like it but the Bluetooth and wifi isnt too great they always cut out and Bluetooth never connects Got 2 weeks ago Only issue is with trying to get Skype to work Battery is only lasting 8 to 10 hours on a full charge with low to moderate use No apps are left running Location ext is off so I dont know why Also blue tooth does not go into discovery mode Love the volume the large font and the great graphics on videos and moviesglad I have this phone I like this device  except that it consumes quite a bit of battery rather fast  Mods are nice I switched to Motorola with my last smartphone purchase and havent looked back As a small business owner I need battery life durability and function which Motorola excels at The Moto Z is no different I love the available mods and am looking forward to using the charger and speaker for extended battery life on the go and conference calls in the office The Social Digest is a nice touch on this phone it corrals all of your social media notifications into one place The fast charger is fantastic Its a bit big for me the volume could be louder Awesome my old phone was starting to bomb out  every week and this one has gret memory and the battery life is excellent Im mostly satisfied but there are a few issues that greatly disappoint me

They couldnt transfer my data as in previous versions so I must do it all step by step
  
My previous phone would allow me to chose to view only contacts with a phone  listed in my google accounts  Without that option I have a plethora of contacts with only email addresses that makes my contact list abominably long  annoying to use  I also have an intense dislike for all phone numbers addresses and notes that Ive entered on a contact not showing up without hitting show all  That can still be forgotten and the wrong number dialed because one believes its the only one there

Every previous Droid could be plugged into my computer which allowed me to add photos or excel files easily to be accessed on the phone  This phone will not show the folders or their structure  Their method of adding photos pulls random photos from my hard drive with no apparent rhyme or reason  I have tens of thousands of photos organized my wifes and my family all the way back to the 1800s on the computer but without the tree I cant find the dozen that I desire to keep with me  

I despise not being able to load the old My Verizon Shared Data gaugemeter which I use regularly  This may be a Verizon issue rather than a phone issue

The battery life bright screen and fast recharging are great pluses from all my past phones  I would like to be able to place more icons ie five across in a row on the screens and I also hate the home screen being on the left screen instead of the center screen  All the apps one normally uses can fit on three screens  If the home page is centered one only needs to move one screen left or right depending on the type of app being sought  This makes one retrain his muscle memory as well as having to concentrate more every time one looks for something Just received phone works great Dont  like it as much as my droid max this phone is great accept for the battery  i wish moto used the largermoto z play droid for the moto z droid I ordered this phone online had a little issue getting it connected but after it was connected it has been very similar operation to my droid turbo I love the mods the battery mod is so helpful it charges the phone quickly and doesnt need to stay connected it transfers power to the phone and then can be removed allowing you to reinstall a different mod My new phone is very glitchy  Picture quality is no where near what I was told it would be  Thought I would be soo happy but my droid Maxx is a better phone than this Just bought this phone and truly happy to be back Love my phone Ive had this phone a few weeks and the battery is great I like it better than my Samsung Great phone and network This phone is horrible and annoying It does not perform any of the functions that my Samsung phones did I am terribly dissapointed Not really that happy with my new phone not very simple to use  as my last phone my and this will be my LAST phone on Verizon since I had so many problems when buying it all the new tec is not for me I made a big mistake buying a new phone Still trying to get used to this new phone 1st smart phone Only have had for 1 week Over all the phone is great I dont like the text messaging program I dont particularly care for the way you have to delete call history I really dont appreciate having 34 program upgrades I understand these phones sit on a shelf until they are sold and program updates are needed as improvements are made after the phone is ready for market What would be nice is to have them done all at 1 time It seems to be a good phonedo miss some of the features of my LG phonebut am getting used to and enjoying the Moto Z Im happy w my buy  I had a G3 and this is a great upgrade  Only complaints is the keyboard and camera selfies featurenone I got this on recommendation by Verizon guy I wish I got the phone I went in for I have 7 days left to either suck it up and keep it or get something else and dinged for whatever it costs to get something else

The battery life is horrific and I am not a heavy cell phone user by any standard its mostly on standby some texting photo taking use wifi or data about 30 minutes daily  That being said the battery will decline 3040 within 12 hours  My HTC with the same size battery could hold a decent charge for 4 days with the same amount of use  I dont understand

I do like the motion sensor its very bright and Motorola has some nice features that Samsung and HTC do not Im still learning the phone
I dont care about how thin it is Id much rather have a bigger battery  Dont even try to sell me the battery mod either Great but battery doesnt perform as well as what the specs said Sooooo much better than my 4G LG I replaced Love the picture quality wish I could view the results of a picture on the same page as taken without having to exit go to photos and back again to attempt a better photo I had trouble answering from the lock screen at first  I miss the GPS tracker that was in my old phone Early Christmas present to myself so happy I got it Wonderful phone I just got my phone this week  And I love it Easy to setup and use  After all the updates everything works great I would recommend this phone to anyone Has a great camera and most features are the same as my S4 Easy to use very clear pictures and video loud speaker quality and battery life is great Love it I bought this phone two weeks ago and Im falling in love with it Its faster and lighter than my old phone I bought 4 of these for Christmas gifts  I gave one to my mother in law  the phone is constantly rebooting  now I have to go and return it  not a happy customer Possibly going to return the other 3 as well  According to the Internet  this is an issue Great battery life Great photos I am a long time DroidMotorola user  I love the slim sleek feel of this Moto X but when they say 24 hour battery they exaggerated  Thankfully the phone charges quickly 

Apps install and run well and I especially like the built in Moto apps Good phone call audio and network connections Ive had the phone a week with no dropped calls This phone offers the level of security I require for work Its slim light and beautiful As powerful as newest phonesVery Happy overall Like most everything about the phone Only negatives  are battery life battery built into and if you use any add ons you cant use a case I finally cracked the screen on my aging Razr Maxx and had to replace it This new Moto Z Droid a has a bigger screen b runs much faster c charges very quickly
But on the downside a it lacks a separate notification LED to inform you of missed calls incoming messages etc b does not have a headphone jack although an adapter cable is provided but is a bit clumsy c is so thin that I fear that I will soon crack this even larger screen like the little bigger screen and thinner  profile If you are tired of Apple  Samsung and need a change this is it 4GB ram snapdragon 820 Expandable memory and a very good camera The Moto Mods are a bonus and really set this phone apart from the rest I thought Id cry if I didnt get the phone But I was so happy when I bought it Bought this to replace my old phone with insufficient memory and poor camera performance  This is a wonderful upgrade Ive had this phone for about 2 weeks and the reception is horrible I have been a customer of Verizons for several years and never had problems with reception however this phone doesnt work in my home I tried to make the Moto Z work for me but I miss my Samsung Side buttons are small no indicator light for incoming messages and the phone is a bit longer than I wanted The features that do come with it is great though Excellent sound Calls are incredibly clear Great camera Easy to use The battery life is good but was hoping of a more dramatic improvement from my previous phone The good news is the turbo battery charge is very fast Im so very glad I bought this new phone I love the fingerprint sensor to unlock it Really nice phone runs really smoothly and everything is set up really nice too Its super convenient features such as the touch pad that can turn my screen on or off helps out a lot too Was really a tough choice what I found that I like most about it is the mods even though they seem to be on a bit of the expensive side just love the idea of many tools Generally happy with the Moto z Just realized that power cord does not have USB end on it that would allow direct hook up to my computer Every other phone Ive had offered this feature I bought this phone and would of liked a manual to go through all of the apps and set ups Each phone is different Great phone other than I never noticed it doesnt have a headphone jack I am still learning about it but enjoying it so far Had problems with Verizon Cellular Sales not wanting to give me a new phone that they had in the store because they already ordered one so I was inconvenienced for a few days My new Moto Z Droid is so easy to use After everything was transferred I started using it I reccomend getting the protective cover for it It feels like its not even there besides you can never be too sure I needed a new phone since only owning for a little over a week it is hard to fully review but as of now it seems to be feature rich  thin and was very easy to begin using it has prompts to help you with the set up of each item So far very pleased Way too much interaction to make the answer feature work smoothly Way too many graphics get in the way Other than that I like the other features The camera on the phone is very good Still learning this phone  Unfortunately no classes at my Verizon store until January  Also am unable to synch the Bluetooth on my car  not happy about that had for it a close to 2 weeks clear sound no problems so far I bought this phone about 10 days ago and I am very happy with it Does a lot of things but none well  Too many limitations on file saving and other functions to sell band width  Marketing overwhelms customer satisfaction This phone has the best sound quality of any Ive owned Although there is no message indicator light I love the fact I can just wave my hand over the screen to check for notifications So happy to switch phone  carrier Like the phone but accessories are not easy to find I bought this phone last week and I am loving it The phone is very flexible and easy to model to your preferences and the Moto gear function is just phenomenal The Moto camera takes some of the best pictures Ive ever had For the first time I was also able to change the Google maps guidance voice to Australian accent No other phone Ive had let me do that and I change phones once a year Ive had this phone barely a week and have been tempted to return it I hate the poo looking emojis plus they never stay attached to my texts after I hit send if i add them while writing The keyboard doesnt have the punctuation in the same screen as the letters so to punctuate I have to move from one screen to another Then a bit ago I tried editing the writing in a text and the delete kept hoping to the end of the text rather than the first word where I kept putting the curser There quite a few strange quirks like that these are the reason for the low rating Really The emojis look like a pile of Dodo great phone too short too bad Great quality and features Id definitely by another Moto in the future Nice Phone graphics are amazing Up graded from flipphone WOW I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone Ive had for more than 2 years I was afraid to get another Samsung since the rumors right now are that theyre blowing up So the sales guy recommended the Moto Z Droid I had seen the commercials and dont plan on using any of the attachments ever  
I really miss having the notification light I REALLY hate that there isnt a home button and the fingerprint scanner is the only button on the screen of the phone so its a major waste if you dont use the fingerprint And you cant just use the fingerprint you have to use that AND a password or pin or pattern I dont like that I cant create folders in the apps storage to more easily hide the ones I dont frequently use Lastly and Im not sure this is the phone or the user the sales guy but the way my contacts transferred over is ridiculous I have 9 of the same person and three of this other person it saved only this persons work phone number I only had 67 contacts to transfer but that number more than tripled with a lot of the same contacts  That has really ticked me off  
On the plus side the phone is very fast the screen is bigger it was easy to purchase accessories online I like how quickly it charges I like how long it can stay alive the quick functions like flicking the phone a certain way turns on the camera or flashlight are very convenient The camera is better than my old phone and there is a flash for the front camera too Overall any new phone was going to be an upgrade from my 2 year old phone I bought it 2 weeks ago and was a little iffy about it because we are not droid fans period but this droid just brought us back Love everything about it so far very easy to use and get use to I bought a Moto Z Droid about a week ago and immediately experienced problems connecting to the Internet over wifi There was a problem with the hardware of the phone Today I was able to return to the authorized retailer who exchanged the defective Moto Z with a new one I am happy to report on the great features amazing camera and wifi contability of my new Moto Z I am absolutely in love with this phone as well as its ability for mods I love this phone its so much better than the other phone I had Enjoy the new features  easy to use Its does seem pretty fast there isnt a bunch of preloaded junk on it Thats a big plus the bad news the battery life leaves much to be desired Alittle bit smaller than my Nexus 6 but thats okay but my battery life was still better All and all great phone though nice geek tricks youll still like it I wont buy this poor excuse for a cell phone Another chunk of green for a projector and another chunk of green for a snapon battery ect Does this thing come with a holster to carry all this junk What a terribly poor design The agent suggested this but I am not sold on it  Only keeping it because of restock fee  If you dont mind vibrating when touching buttons or a smaller screen this is a great phone Great service and the Moto z I got I love it I purchased this phone because the phone that I had for about 5 yrs was dying This phone has some wonderful features Im still learning how to work everything The size and weight were the main reason for the MOTO being my new phone So far Im liking this phone I really like the phones capabilities and attachments that goes with it Ive Had this phone For 2 weeks nice phone easy to operate  Had the Droid razor Before defitnley a nice upgrade This is my first smartphone and although the first couple of days were a challenge within a few days Im able to use it fairly well   It has some nice features like voice commands  Im sure Ill learn something new about it each dayweek I purchased the phone a week ago  One issue that I have so far is that the volume level ismuch lower than my Motorola Droid RAZR M  Also I use my phone as a mobile credit card reader  There is no port to plug in a card reader Had my Moto Z Droid a bit over a month Completely satisfied All the Moto Mods are also an added luxury I recommend this phone to everyone it is so much easier to use than an Iphone with most of the same options Its only been two weeks but Im hooked Bought Moto Zs with battery mod for my wife and myself Performance and battery lif are absolutely wonderful The battery drains fast This phone overall it nice biggest disappointment is the battery life Before buying I read reviews overall great reviews about phone So both my husband and myself bought this phone He is a truck driver so he need his phone to last he got the force The biggest well only complaint is battery lofe Seems like the phone battery last most the day as long as you dont use the phone at all Maybe we were spoiled by our Samsung notes but I typically have to charge Moto at least 2 times to make it though the day sometimes more I do use my phone but no more than I used my Samsung which I usually only charge at night and was fine for the day I lower the brightness and turn off location no Bluetooth and still dies quickly I also make sure there is no apps running in the back round  Positive is charger does charge fast but if you are not in a area you can plug your out of luck The phone is thin and has options to add speaker projector camera and ext battery all sold separately and are pricey Other then the battery I do like this phone it has a good camera and lost of options I just bought it last week and I am still adjusting I used to be able to control sounds and notifications for each app by going to settings This is driving me crazy trying to figure it out I dont like the constant notifications from Facebook and emails but need to know when someone is texting me Turning the volume down is not an option Proven brand and reliability Its pretty easy to use but it gets hot fairly quickly Some kind of an actual guide with it wouldnt be a terrible idea And itd be nice to get this predictive index banner off the top of the keyboard I am still learning all of the features of my new phone It has all of the features I loved in my previous Droid as well as so many added bonuses Great screen and camera easy to use I bought this phone a little over a week ago The salesperson said it was a great phone Well it is not I was told the battery was very good Well it is not I cannot make it to lunch without recharging The charger is different so I cant use my old chargers from my other android phones Now I have to bring my charger with me everywhere Ive had my new Moto for 3 weeks and Im in love Ive had Samsung phones for 5 years and had no idea how much better Moto had made the Android experience I have had Samsung phones since the S2  I went to the S3 S4 then to Note 3 Note 4 and Note 5  I have loved every single one of them  I wanted the Note 7 but you know that story  I was looking at the G S7 Edge when my friend told me about the Moto Z  He went with me to look at it and I decided I had to give this phone a try  He has Mods you can get with it so I got the extended batterywireless charger the projector and the add on camera that has a telescoping lense  They all are very cool and work really well  I cant recommend this phone enough Had to give up my Samsung bc it was a fire hazard this phone is terrible touch screen is horrible mic talk to txt never wants to work battery is useless and never pulls any wifi The Z Droid doesnt have many of the features Id come to love with my Turbo The battery was supposed to last longer it doesnt and there is always static in the ear when I am on the phone Ive had it less than 2 wks and I have already had to do a factory reset Still learning how to use my phone as there were not a lot of direction just love the phone and it features Every time the phone moves the time pops up  No way to shut it down so the battery life sucks The stock apps are far inferior to those on the Samsungs have had this phone for 15 days and love it already Very user friendly and great quality I bought it a week ago not really happy This is an excellent phone and is a very easy transition from the iPhone I had previously Go into the Verizon store and play with all of the phones there Only a few stand out and that includes this Moto Z This phone is extremely well built and it just works The battery life and signal reception are excellent If you live in an area without a great signal like I do then you need this phone The reception is much better than the iPhone The phone is not loaded with a ton of extra software and it all works flawlessly I checked out the newest iPhone and it just feels like a toy compared to this phone I would recommend the Moto Z to anyone looking for a great affordable smartphone I bought this phone for my wife  It took her a few days to get used to it but now she absolutely loves it This phone does not have good battery life  I find some apps are glitchy  The speaker on phone calls is tinny sounding  The finger print feature is good  The response time is very good but as I mentioned can be glitchy at times  My worst complaint is the battery life  I do not like that you can not use a cover to protect the whole phone if you use the back cover I havent used any Moto Mods I bought this less than a month ago but  it so far I am not loyal to Android or Apple phones but having said that I came from an iPhone 6s I purchased this through my local Verizon store so I was able to have a hands on experience The manager of the store had the projection moto mod and I thought that was a very cool feature I was looking to go back to the Android OS again and Samsung didnt appeal to me at the moment thank goodness after the NOTE battery fires Having this phone since its release I can say I have a lovehate relationship with it The internal battery is terrible so I had to purchase the battery mod without the external battery this phone would be useless It doesnt make the phone much thicker though but I find it a necessity The camera is nice when you have full light to take pictures in BUT low light pictures are some of the worse I have seen on a phone as of late My older 6s blew this camera out of the water Some apps I use work most of the time but I find this phone to be buggy I dont know why some apps work and some do not but it can be a pain in the rear There are times someone will send me a text message and the phone never notifies me This happens with FULL cellular signal and 4GLTE I have reset the phone turned it off and back on and nothing fixes that problem The volume is also terrible and when turned up to its max is still to low to hear especially in a busy environment The fingerprint scanner is a very nice feature that I use for almost everything The screen resolution is also nice and I have no complaints there I would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants a stable phone I  think I got hooked on the moto mods to which I only have the battery mod pack and didnt get as OCD which I normally do I dont think I will have this phone very long This phone is wafer thin and does it all Screen is bright and big Fingerprint scanner is excellent Battery lasts all day Best phone I ever had Switched back to Android from Windows because of the disappearing apps I chose this phone because I didnt want an iPhone wannabe  I love the motion features like turning on the flashlight and camera Camera could be better but I guess most cameras wont compare to my old Lumia icons features and lenses But so far feels solid and smooth Only had phone for 2 weeks but its by far the best Ive ever owned This issuch a great phone bought it a couple weeks ago not the phone I wanted wanted the Samsung note 5 was not available for the price I could afford It will have to do for now
 Ive had it for 8 days and been back to the store twice with issues A new issue popped up today I couldnt get a mobile deposit accepted by my credit union Still trying Dont know if its the photos which dont look very clear to me or what yet Also the battery isnt any longer lasting than the one I just turned in Another issue which is overrideable is it doesnt recognize Google only Google Chrome Ive only had the phone a week In that week there have been 2 ota updates that have ultimately ruined the speaker performance on the phone The notifications are so quiet that you cant hear them unless youre in a really quiet place I had the Samsung Note7 in my hands the first day it came out and something just told me to wait a few weeks because I expected defects The Verizon man also told me to wait and maybe consider a previous Note like the 4 which still had a removable battery We both had no idea that a defect this serious would have happen with Samsung phones With that said I went back to motorola because prior to my S3 I had a droidx  Ive had this phone for 3 weeks now Its everything I need Its fully functional super fast and I was instantly sold on Moto mod capable My only issue is the home screen button is part of screen and while texting I often hit it instead of the space bar Other than that the speaker could be louder but its loud enough to wake me up in the morning and be heard downstairs while ringing Overall its a great Phone  dont be afraid to leave Apple and Samsung for it I had a Moto Droid Turbo and liked the phone with the textured holster and kick stand  This Z wont fit a holster due to the extra Tumi battery pack is too thick  The phone is so slippery I constantly almost drop it  On top of that the screen is right to the edge so your fingers while gripping just the sides trigger screen actions  

I am really unhappy with this phone  It is a work tool not a fashion statement to me bought the Moto Z Droid a month ago  I am getting use to the Android OS needs better and easier hands free talking  I like the mods that you can add to the phone  the speaker blew away my friends and the image is sharp I bought this phone last week when i was on vacation I get on the plane to come home only to find out that the phone does not have any phone jacks I was upset and had to fly all the way back to texas with no music Then i tried to charge my phone only to find out that the phone did not have the regular charging port so my phone died if youre looking for the add on gadgets for the phone they are very expensiveother than that it is a good phone with alot of power My phone broke so I had to upgrade Hate to spend so much money on a phone Phones are ridiculously expensive Phone working great so far I originally planned to upgrade to another phone but the Verizon wireless associate showed me the Droid Motto and I was sold I like the slim profile and the lightness Since its an Android phone it was easy for me to use since my old phone was also an Android I bought the phone about a week ago and its awesome I have always been a droid guy and I just upgraded from a Droid Maxx to the Moto Z I really liked my Droid Maxx and so far I have only had it about 2 weeks but I really like the Moto Z The big kicker though now which kinda stinks  wise but technology has changed to make charging better is with the newer Droids is you will be buying all new acessories so add another 6090 to your upfront costs especially chargers as they charge your phone extremely faster which I love but they use a different connector now But I love the phone so far the battery does drain quicker than my Maxx did but I can still get a good 24hrs on a charge with light data use and maybe turning the Battery Saver on so its not too bad Plus you can charge your phone in about 15min now compared to my old Maxx which could take 45 hours to completely charge I got this phone because I broke my 2 year old Droid Turbo and couldnt get a replacement  Heres my procon list
PRO
light and thin
Good display
like the fingerprint lock
Like the magnet back innovation and potential accessories

CONS
Only ok audio I like my phone to be a good PHONE first and foremost
no earbud jack
mediocre battery life
less good camera than the Turbo for lighting and correct color without color adjustment options either
new charger plug means I need to buy all new chargers
NONE OF THE CHARGERS HAVE USB ENDS meaning you have to buy ANOTHER cable beyond the factory charger it comes with in order to synch with your computer
apps menu is now scroll instead of leftright swipe meaning you have to look down to get an app like Maps or Waze instead of swipe swipe tap because you know where your apps are  Lazy design work
Less intuitive layoutusage  Trying to upload ringtones thanks to poor layout and also lack of USB charging cable took far too long  I wound up downloading new ones from a website

In short its trying to be an Apple phone instead of the next fabulous iteration of a Droid  Droid we love you  because you ARENT Apple  Stick with what you know and get rid of the four steps to do things where there used to be only one step One thing I think that Verizon and Google play could do is if you wanted to get an app but wanted to see what its like instead of having to download the whole app make it so you can download a trial of the app and if they want to keep playing they can download the app off the Google play store but thats just my opinion I cant connect to my car blue tooth  with my phone for receiving phone calls  The only way someone I can hear anyone is if I put my phone on speaker which is dangerous when driving I bought this last weekend I like it except for when Im on the phone and have it on speaker   
Everyone tells me that they can hardly hear me I go in and out and sound like Im in a tunnel What can I do about this Its been good so far I love this phone and the length of the charge and how quickly it recharges Battery that comes with the phone leases a little to be desired  It seems to improve a little with use and keeping the apps turn off  Changing the location of the onoff and volume buttons on the side takes some getting use to Basically the same as the LG G3 I traded for it it looks better is faster but user customizations wont work for ringtones if you create your own edits Home charger is hardwired so no pulling the USB3 wire for optional connection or PC interface
This phone feels like Motorola is just dusting itself but still needs direction Get a clue Awesome phone But the speaker is a little weak Good phone easy to use Phone screen cracked the second day I had itnot even a week later and the screen stopped working as I took the speaker attachment off the phone I planned to return before cracking my screen because I didnt like the camera My pictures were very grainy Im two months into my Moto Z and as a life long Motorola owner always on big red I can say that this is the best and most innovative phone Ive ever had Its fast Really fast Like scary fast Upgradable memory beautiful all day battery and stunningly thin and fast camera The Moto suite of actions just makes this thing all the sweeter Oh did I mention its modular Any time you want a battery bigger speaker or screen its a click away Best idea ever Love this phone switched from a Droid Turbo My favorite phone so far Switched from the Droid Mini to this phone Took some getting used to just due to size difference but I like this one now Definitely has some cooler features built in eg Flashlight as opposed to having to download apps for it Really hard to find cases for it other than ordering online and no cases exist that will allow you to have any of the mods attached to the phone which is a HUGE fail on the part of every company making cases for this phone I havent had a chance to test out all the features like moto gestures and have yet to spend any money on the moto mods as they can be pricey the projector is half the price of the phone but overall its a good phone I got this phone about a month ago and it is easy to use great camera and fantastic battery life I dont know how to transfer from my old phone to this one I dont like the charger that it takes a usbc I dont care for the volume I have it up as high as it will go and sometimes still cant hear it My Moto Z is by far the best Ive gotten  Last year I upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S4 to the iPhone 6 and discovered that I preferred the setup of the Samsung  So I reverted to the S4 and was reminded of the poor reception from an apparently inferior antenna system in the Samsungabsolutely no service in my building at work where I had somewhat better reception with the iPhone  Well I walked my new Moto into the building yesterday and maintained a 4G and 3G signal  Im very happy  I like the slightly larger size and functions that to me are superior to the iPhone  Ive had every type of cell phone since 1991 brick flip phone blackberry earlier Motorola Razor you name it and Ive discovered the best yet in the Moto Z Love quick charge  Very user friendly and functional  Im hooked on Moto Z  Im a senior and fairly tech savvy but this phone is so easy to set up and use would recommend it for anyone This phone is very basic for what youre paying I switched from my Droid Turbo to this phone only because my Turbo shattered and I returned it after a week or so The operating system is the Marshmallow which is not anything to get excited about The camera is subpar the battery doesnt last for 8 hours and the phone was very glitchy I was not impressed at all especially with the design of the phone Its very thin so thin the phone doesnt come with an aux output Instead you have to use this adaptor cable for headphones which was very annoying Maybe Im the only person who is constantly listening to music on my phone but I was very annoyed with this missing feature The Mods feature doesnt work the way youd think The backs come off the phone rather easily even the basic cover that comes with the phone Love my new phone works great this phone runs so much smother than my last one It was very easy to move my apps and information from my old phone to the new phone  I am enjoying the clarity of the photographs the new phone takes as well as taking advantage of the finger print security  The Moto Z has a lot of great features and Ive only just begun to delve into them I like the mods and ease of use I got the moto Z two weeks ago its fantastic easy to learn the new features and supper fast I bought the battery mod and its great I can go three full days without needing to recharge overall above expectations Not overly expensive great display smooth UI easy to use great onehand features antenna strength could be improved Love the Mods The phone is great much like a Samsung But the accessories make it The battery pack moto mod is awesome I cant wait to try the other mods I purchased a motor droid a month ago  all I can say is WONDERFUL phone i had this phone for about a week and have dropped it a few time and never cracked the screen Love this phone its great Its got great security nifty motion features and you can talk to it and ask it questions The camera is decent too Ive had the device for just over a week now and Im very happy with it The phone looks great and is very easy to hold it is quite a tall phone but narrow and that makes it work well for onehand use The fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast and accurate  Ive never seen any phone work as well as the Moto Z Droid Many reviewers seem to be surprised that the phone doesnt have a 35mm headphone jack which presumably means that they didnt look at the phone before buying it It does come with a usbc to 35mm adapter but because I primarily use bluetooth headphones I havent taken it out of the box yet I think removing such an archaic analog port is the right thing to do but for audiophiles using traditional headphones this may well be a bigger deal for you than it is for me 

I had two concerns when I bought the phone  the camera and battery life The camera  has produced some great photos with three elements Im interested in  focus detail and vibrancy I would agree that it isnt quite as intuitive to use as some other flagships  particularly in low light but given a little time to figure out all of the options in the camera my concern is laid to rest For battery life the question was whether the phone could make it through the day without relying on the battery moto mod as a default The answer for me is yes provided it is a typical day eg downloading and installing the latest security updates does not qualify as typical The Mod provides peace of mind though and means that I dont have to change my usage because if in doubt the mod is there and it replenishes the battery very quickly 

Although much of the media attention for this device has been about the mods or about the lack of the headphone jack where the phone really shines is in terms of software If youve used a Moto X in the past you already know that the software creates an experience that in my view is unmatched The always on display just wave your hand over the phone chop chop for the flashlight double twist for the camera texts read to you when you are driving custom launch phrase screen that stays on when it knows you are reading etc All of this over an otherwise vanilla Android that just flies without a stutter or lag 

The Moto mods are a great concept with really smart engineering to make them work so seamlessly Personally I dont think you should buy the phone just for the mods  they are icing on the cake for an amazing phone 

Im very happy with the Moto Z Droid and would happily recommend it to others This is the Droid I was looking for I bought this phone last thursday and im happy with everything so far The sales rep took his time helping me understand and learn most of what my new phone could do and how some of the new accessories worked Ive been a Verizon customer for 8 years i love some of the moto mods the phone has the extra battery life and the screen is clear and sharp I have it two weeks Overall its a great phone the only draw back is the lack of an earphone port One needs to use a converter in the USBC portjust one more thing to lose Easy to get used to since it is the Android platform Easy to figure out how to personalize Only downfall is getting out of a game by getting the navigation buttons up is sometimes tricky But Im sure it will get easier with time Slim even when you add on the battery pack mod Loving the wood grain back And this thing does not lag I have only had one problem and its rare which is the Bluetooth not connecting Otherwise this phone is better than the iPhone 7 Finally something different Btw the magnets just work It is always static in phone calls and the screen is not clear at all I bought this phone a few weeks and Im glad I did Still trying to figure things out  No directions manual the speaker is low and in fron stactic Happy with my phone Wouldnt have anything but a Motorola phone Very fast great screen great battery Moto speaker is fabulous but heavy still trying to figure some things out great phone Its a little bigger than I expected but so far far exceeds my expectations Good phone Like it a lot I dont like that you cant get the volume out of it like my old phone but it is close great phone dont think the hotspot picks up as good as the old moto xbut overall happy with the product I have read review after review and have always had an affinity for Motorola products  When I knew I was coming up on upgrade eligibility hands downs I knew I wanted the latest and greatest and this was it Dont like the phone It was time to retire my old Droid so I went with the new Moto Z I love the phone and all of the great functionality but it is just too large for my taste I am going to keep the phone because it suits my needs very well and there just arent very many small phones out there The slim design helps with the size a little bit Im a guy and I would normally keep the phone in my front pants pocket Seriously I think this phone would be just perfect if the screen was about twothirds the size We will see how it holds up over time I bought this phone a week ago and Im very unhappy with it The battery drains when the phone is shut off I loose people all the time or they conversation is cut up So you cant understand them Bought this phone a week ago and I love it Bought it about 2 weeks ago everything working well I have loved both Droid phones I have owned Happy I bought the phone Still learning to use features Bought this on labor day 2016  Like it alot  Best phone that I have had in 10 years Im very happy with the Moto Z Marshmallow is much better than KitKat I had a Droid Maxx before and this is the first flagship phone Ive had and I made a good choice Thanks Verizon Great phone  Just bummed that there is no headset jack  I know thats the direction some phones are going but I dont agree with it  Other than that no other complaints at all Ive had a good bit of time to test this out now  I use a tech21 case and have not played around with the mods yet The phone is awesome and people are blown away by the video and photo quality Even tho it is not as good as the force in megapixels it still excels as a daily shooter for me I have dropped it face down on pavement twice without a scratch perhaps thanks to the tech21 and the screen protector For me the shatterproof would have been a nice addition but I prefer the slimness of this phone It is ideal It is so easy to use with one hand or two and has many accessibility options On my old phone turbo my hand would press the screen when I tried to reach all the way to the top corners This one I can use and it does not detect any false presses The battery is adequate but makes me feel a bit like an iPhone user being more tethered to the wall I love everything about it ignore the haters because they have unrealistic expectations Phone is a beast and is pure quality Great phone
It is very fast and easy to use I have had this phone 1 month and it has locked up and I have had to pull the SIM card to reset it  Now it is overheating not powering up and buzzing if sim card is in  They better give me a new phone tomorrow when I go to Verizon store I want a power pack pod for it and the one that turns the camera phone into one with a zoom lens The phone functions just fine but its so thin and the surfaces are so slick I always feel like Im about to drop the phone If Id spent more time holding it in my hand I probably would not have bought this phone I replaced my previous droid moto with the moto Z The phone is nice overall I like the fingerprint pad and it works well Its much easier than entering in a PIN I like the USBC plug even though I had to replace all my charge cords Also the thinness of the phone comes at a price Battery life with the internal battery is not good But my biggest complaint is that this phone is buggy several of my apps  that worked perfectly with the previous moto routinely crash on the moto Z Im oldfashioned enough that I use my phone for calling and this phone is a huge step up from the Droid Turbo it replaced in terms of call quality so a big plus for that  On the flip side the Turbo battery life spoiled me and this phone is not nearly as longlived  a tradeoff from the slim size I suppose  Manage your apps and your screen options carefully and youll be fine  App installation and translation was smooth except for Gallery  I had to download a 3rd party app because Google Photos just doesnt work as well as my old Gallery did and I dont like all my photos automatically going to the Cloud This is my first smart phone Ive had a flip phone for years So it is frustrating to use for nowgetting help from various sources Love the photo quality Purchased Aug 17th  Within 2 weeks of buying the phone I dropped it and shattered the screen  The new replacement was easy and fast but I noticed quite a difference in the batteries of the 2  Moto Zs    My 1st phone seemed to lose battery power Very quickly with normal use and usually I found I had to charge it by mid afternoon  It also took a long time to charge and I was honestly getting somewhat annoyed   The phone I have now is wonderful and the battery is great  No need to charge it as often and the charging time is so much faster  All the settings were identical for each phone   I honestly think that anyone who is having battery issues needs to go get it checked and hopefully you can return it for a replacement  It seems like some of the batteries are faulty 
The Moto Z is a fantastic phone and I am so glad I bought it
I hope they correct the battery problem  
The only other request I would like is that they make All cell phones shatter proof We certainly pay enough A little different from previous Motorola but learning something new everyday I bought this phone one week ago  So far so good  Lots of fun features  The moto mods are cool and easy to use I have the JBL speakerbattery  Battery life is OK but my old Droid MAXX held a charge longer This was the smallest phone that verizon offers with the exception of the iphone and it is still way too big  Since i dont like apple the iphone wasnt an option for me  I miss my android mini  This phone is big enough that it is actually difficult to hold onto  Im over 6 tall so its not like I am a petite person with small hands either Great phone but has some hiccups playing videos I love this phone and the Moto mods I wish it had custom themes and a headphone jack Other than that I absolutely love it I love the always listening device I love the software on the phone Its so quick The fingerprint scanner is one of the best I have used on any phone The Moto speaker dock is so awesome It makes listening to music a pleasure I bought this phone a week ago an already want to get another for my wife Reminds me of my galaxy I thought I might have a hard time transitioning to the larger size of the Moto Z coming from a Droid Turbo but I am very happy with the bigger screen The thinness of the phone is also great I am however very disappointed in the batter life of the phone Fully charged in the morning I find myself having to recharge by noon every day easy to use and looks great with the thin design Had phone a few weeks so far so good  Bit I didnt realize that there was no spot for ear buds I only realized it when I went to plug in ear bugs the other day  So I t would be nice to have Purchased the Moto Z Droid to upgrade a Droid Turbo In the weeks I have owned it I have found it to be fast and user friendly Problems I have discovered are network drops and GPS loss in areas I have never had problems before It is nice to have the SD Card back Dont let the small battery size fool you  This phone is super frugal on standby time  With normal in and out checking email minor use for navigation some internet searches and a few apps this phone can easily last all day  Processor is very fast does not seem like you wait for anything but downloads  This thing is so ridiculously thin I have been calling the plain back that comes with it my training back since every time I take it off the phone feels too thin compared to my Droid Turbo so I put it back on  Eventually I will probably take the plain back off permanently Builtin speaker is decent  The improvements to Moto are very nice  Hands free in the car is improved because the commands got simpler It seems like the phone interprets the commands much more accurately also I did not buy this phone because of the fingerprint reader I was never one to lock my phone anyway because of the nuisance of unlocking it every time I wanted to look at it  However this fingerprint reader is so simple to set up and use I am now using it every day It is no more difficult than pressing a home button and works every time  I set it for my index finger on my right hand and my thumb on the left and it works every time I have had other family members try to open it with the reader and it always stays locked  Charge time is insanely short  It usually takes less than an hour to come up from 3540 to full charge And unlike my Droid Turbo the turbo charge on the car actually works on turbo Dont be fooled by the battery size This phone is optimized and the battery lasts
Super fast phone smooth as silk didnt want a plastic screen so I chose this over the force I am very happy with this purchase I only had it a week Cant wait to get the speaker mod for it Only issue there is no headphone jack in the phone I have to use a additional piece for my headphone and aux cord in my car So now I gotta make sure I dont lose it  I like that you can add speakers but you cant have a headphone jack I purchased the Moto Z Force a week or so ago and Im satisfied overall One thing that did throw me off guard was that there was no Aux cord hole Im a big fan of the Aux cord As my vehicle does not have Bluetooth Im always reaching for the cord It is great that I am still able to listen to my own music with the alternative cord for my phone but it seemed like that was the only thing that was missing Only had it for week now never liked moto before but this phone is awesome for even a 54 yr old like me havent been this pleased with a cell phone in couple of years tried I phone Samsung HTC Asus several brands but this tops them all no hype just facts love this phone once it catches on it will give iPhone and Samsung run for their money I give it a 10 Very fast phone Screen is great and the battery life is fantastic Just picked up the battery Moto Mod and it is really easy to use and adds wireless charging too Happy so far Verizon needs to make their long time customers feel appreciated without trying to change their plans  increasing charges where other carries are not Easy to use and get familiar with Should have stayed with Samsung  I dont like that you have to have an adapter to have headphones plugged in and I dont always use wireless headphones so keeping up with an adapter is inconvenient The battery life is terrible  Motorolas fix  basically dont use the phone  For lack of a better term I was shamed by a motorola rep for my phone having a screen time of 5 12 hours in one day  Honestly I would certainly not consider that heavy use of a smart phone  As a professional most of us use our phones hours a day for emails and work productivity I am no different  The battery life should last at least 12 hours of moderate use This does not

Furthermore the other fix was to turn off either data or wifi every time every time Im not using my phone  How is that in line with how a typical smart phone user uses and depends on their phone  Its not  My Samsung S4 Active at 3 12 years old had a better battery life  This phone is also heavy and the location of the volume controls are awkward especially for people with smaller hands like myself  

I have taken to deleting or disabling every app I do not need or is not necessary for running this phone  That means there are quite a few apps I use in my day to day life as a professional I have yet to install in fear of further battery draw  I certainly did not think a new phone would limit my ability to be productive and I fear this one will

Additionally this phone is poor in quality in terms of durability and construction  I had it three days and the screen cracked  For the record it was not dropped stepped on sat on or mishandled in any way  My S4 Active that thing was dropped down concrete steps basement steps swiped off countertops onto ceramic floors etc not a crack to be found  Im extremely disappointed in this phones durability and quality construction  

As for the technology of the phone its okay The picture quality is sufficient for my use of this product    

For this being a product Motorola put out to compete with Samsung and Apple I believe it fails miserably  I should have stuck with Samsung and gone for the S7 Already drop it 10 times still works fine this phone has everything you need Very thin and very powerful  I dont like that they changed from microusb to usbc Bought this a week ago and the design is pretty neat  The camera is good the battery lasts what you would typically imagine but it fully charges in an hour which is great  A few downfalls is that the sound when you are talking and have it on speaker is quite soft  Also there is no headphone jack which seems quite odd Fair phone compared to my old one Nothing about this phone makes me go wow It works It is extremely slippery You have to buy a case or risk easily dropping it  Without the extra attachable speaker its really quiet I was super bummed that I cant set the alarm with my music anymore Also bummed it doesnt have some of the features on my old phone Stepped backwards I guess Oh well I got the Droid Moto Z Force a few weeks ago And I am in love Its not to bulky and its fast And the mods are incredible Especially the JBL speaker Bought this phone 1 week ago So far so good Just came from an iphone 5c I was ready to go to an AndroidOnly complaint is that I can no longer text with only one hand as the screen is too big and I cant reach the far side of the keyboard Also the phone does not come with a cord that has a USB end So I had to special order one so I can connect it to my laptop By far the best droid phone out there  extremely fast so Ive only had the phone for a few weeksso maybe its great for features etc  But a part broke off at the top where the SD chip and SIMM card go in the second time it was opened up before I even left the store  Poorly designed and even more poorly glued No photo or video to add Have had for 4 days now super fast light weight and works great  Couldnt ask for a better phone Bought a week ago 60 contacts didnt download big learning curve from old phone Still playing with it It runs Androi but I put the windows 10 skin on it so I have my familiar tiles with all the advantages of Android The phone charges super fast screen is nice and big while the phone is light and thin The Mods are easy to change Modular design and add on are the best Only have had it for a couple of weeks  Enjoying the features Cant believe how great his phone is my concept mods good if they can grow the line of products offered X mods I have the audio version and it is unbelievable phone is fantastic best phone ever battery life is incredible charging time is incredible it is great Have had phone for about two weeks  Works well very clear with phone calls  Picture quality is not the best  Has a lot of great features however some are tricky to learn how to use  Lots of upgrades from previous droid phones Bought as a birthday gift for my wife she absolutely loves this phone Purchased 2 weeks ago and absolutely love it I got this phone to replace an Samsung Note4 I didnt want to spend the money for the Note 7   So I settled on this  It isnt a Note 7 but good value for what it does    Screen  is a little smaller than it looks since soft home and back buttons take up part of the screen   Battery life isnt quite as long as I would like

I love the finger print reader the wireless does not work as well as old phone Battery does not last as long as they say The Moto Z is a great phone Whether unlocking via the fingerprint reader or playing games this thing is fast I really appreciate that I can have a svelte phone when I want or a bulky tank if I expect to be away from my charger for an extended period The Moto Mods concept is a wonderful take on modularity I have the Incipio wireless battery Moto Mod and the JBL speaker Moto Mod Both function flawlessly with the phone I bought this phone a week ago because my old turbo wouldnt charge Could not obtain a charging cable that would do the job I miss the ability to crop photos like my old Android I have had the phone a week and I love it I wish there was a place to put my ear buds in instead of an attachment piece I have to carry around Have been a droid user for years so I appreciate the similar functionality without having to relearn where to find everything  Battery life lasts no where near what we were told  Usually down to 50  or less by end of day with conservative usage  Husband has the same phone with the same issue Internal speaker quality when we talk does not appear to be as good as the Moto X phone cuts in and out at times when we speak  Limited options for protective cases  A little larger for my personal preference but is extremely thin which is nice  Nice mod options to be able to attach I really like the fingerprint reader and stock Android The fingerprint reader doubles as a lock screen switch I personally wouldnt want it to double as a home button nor would I want the fingerprint reader to be on the back of the device I get a full day out of a single charge and I do appreciate the fast charging My device is usually fully charged in less than 30 min The lack of a headphone adapter is not a deal breaker My previous phone has problems with dust in the 35 mm jack and had to be cleaned frequently Perhaps the USBC interface will work better The phone is super fast and the display is excellent I like the Moto z but would like to see phone cases that cover the phone with the power pack attached This phone has amazing quality photos  The speaker is great  Its easy to use and the battery life is amazing  Its super thin  lightweight too My phone runs very hot and the battery runs down in less than 2 hours All of my contacts didnt transfer over I cant figure out how to add contacts and I dont like how the home screen always rotates And I know I filmed 2 videos of grandchild this weekend and they are no where to be found    Im seriously thinking of returning it today So today August 13 2016 my phone stop charging for about  6 hours and then it started back charging and two days after I got the phone on the 6 of August and it over heated and turned off and back on And it freezes up during text and calls Bought this phone for the extended battery capability Phone works great nice set of features and has endless possibilities with the add on feature So far havent had any problems and I really like that I can Uninstaller or disable a lot more of the useless apps that get stuck on these things I got this a couple of weeks ago and so far I have no problems with this phone is way better then my old phone The Moto z has been wonderful  Recommend the extra battery as it makes the phone truly last 24 hours  Love the phone I like the ease of using the phone  I think this phone was a great purchase because the face of the phone is crisp  clear and easy to read I bought this a week ago cause my phone died  Sales Rep was great too This phone is smarter than me  which may make me jealous at times  I love how the intuitive popups have guided me through the process of setting up my preferences etc Very fast great response and good battery life I have the speaker mod and it is awesome it has great sound and has 5 hours of its own battery life so it doesnt drain the phone Would love to get the projector mod but for now it cost more than I am willing to pay Just need to know where are my contacts Upgrade less than a week Bought this pretty much on release day and love it Everything is snappy Quick Camera is a decent quality The Moto mods are fantastic in my opinion and leave this phone will plenty of potential Love it Glad I didI would recommend it This phone is great I always use Motorola since cell phones began This one changes one item I dont understand why the change It combines phone ring volume and notification volume Can workaround but most people want a loud ring quiet notification  Also removal of mods to use a case seems a drawback especially for the battery mod Those are the only things I can see that anyone could improve on I would absolutely recommend this phone Just got it a week ago and it is great Very easy to use fast charging And amazing pictures After a week with the Moto Z I am super impressed It was very easy to configure and personalize Data transfer was a breeze and both WiFi and Cell connection are rock solid and strong The phone is fast and the mods work great I have the JBL Soundbooster and the Incipio battery mod The battery mod gives me 2 days before charging and adds little weight Droid is back with a scorching hot smartphone I have had this phone for over a week now and overall I am happy with it  Pictures are  great with super high resolution  Only complaint so far is battery life and if I use the phone frequently I may need to recharge during the day The most difficult part is that this phone did not come with any set up booklet and I am having a devil of a time trying to figure things out Additionally it wont sync with my Fitbit nor my Bluetooth speakers  I think I have paid a lot for a phone I am unsureof  This phone was just released a couple days ago and I waited for my upgrade to be able to get it  I bought the accessories and within one day my phone broke  The screen is more sensitive than the iPhone  It says its got Gorilla Glass but thats a joke really light drop shattered everything  I loved my turbo and it was durable  Would not recommend this to any one Love my new phone Very easy to use Great battery life Battery mod is excellent east to use So glad I finally decided it was time for new phone I am happy I stuck with Samsung I have had the s3 s5 now the s7 loved them all A little awkward without a back at first but very nice with the snap on back and the mods attached Excellent battery life and with the battery pack it lasts 2 full days Camera quality is nice but with the ois it can be tricky when moving too much Besides that wonderful Its been two weeks and Im slowly learning but love everything about it and easier to read emails and phone numbers I would like someone to call me because this is been a horrible experience my device is not working properly what so ever and I have 2 already exchanged it for another device with having it with about five days of use this is not right my proximity sensor does not work whatsoever I bought this phone 1 week ago 90 sure I would take it back Why Because ive been using Iphones since the VERY first one a decade ago  I tried android about 3 years ago and immediately returned the phone and stuck with Iphone  I dont know if its this phone or how far android has come but I am a convert  The power of the phone is amazing Everything opens in an instant its quick to open apps browse youtube etc  Everything is fast  I love the option to review texts etc with the press of my finger rather than opening the phone  
As for the moto z  Its a GORGEOUS phone  Quaity steel construction and beautiful glass front  My only complaint would be the HUGE camera bump However the phone is too thin  yes i said too thin so I use the included back plate at all times anyway completely negating the camera bump
Battery life is meh   but I dont want the heavier Moto z force so Ill buy the moto mod tumi battery pack and snap that on when I need more juice
All in all im an android user now and happy to be so I bought this phone a few weeks ago and have had no problems and enjoy very much  My only issue is that my previous MotorolaDroid chargers do not work with this phone The Moto Z had different input so that is kinda a bummer This is a huge upgrade from my previous phone 2014 Moto X but its really the mods that make this amazing  The cost of each mod is prohibitive but they function so much better than their standalone equivalents  The way they integrate into a seamless whole becomes something greater than the sum of its parts I preordered the Moto Z and received it on July 28th  Here are my impressions thus far

Battery Life  I consistently end the day with 25 remaining and thats using it primarily to text and browses the Internet via WiFi Very little 4G use at this point so be warned The only plus is the turbocharging mode that puts me at 75 in 15 minutes

Fingerprint sensor  It works great and its all I use to wake and sleep the device 

Display Bright and very readable great for games and videos

Camera  Works well but does not deliver consistent shots in the same light Being an amateur photographer I have always taken multiple shots so I usually get at least one good one anyway

Controls  The placement of the volume controls is frustrating to get used to  They moved the power button under the volume controls

Size With the Incipio Dual Pro case which incidentally I dont like the phone is even wider but still thin I have large hands so its not a problem my wife however would never want one due to the shear size For those considering buying the Moto Z the available cases will only fit on the device when there are no Moto Mods attached As an FYI the aforementioned case is a pain to remove and yet another reason it will be replaced when Otterbox releases theirs

Why I chose the Moto Z  As a software developer I prefer the minimalist Moto UI approach unlike the Samsung Touch Wiz and others Beautiful but 
Dont  like no ear phone jack on top Being a girl I have lots of diff dust plugs for bling 
Tiny speaker at top 
Kinda heavy to be so slim 
Also no shells for girls Shes naked Bought Kates shell but too thick Was surprised since shell that came in box is great but ugly color for girls grey So bummed I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and so far I love it It is so fast and responsive The finger print reader is instant and accurate The rear camera takes amazing quality pictures The ability to add mods to it is awesome Just wish there was more mod options The only thing I dislike about the phone is as a developer and power user having a phone with an unlockable bootloader is a HUGE drawback I have actually considered returning it and getting a different phone just for that reason However I love the phone so much I cant bring myself to return it Super user friendly The Mod Power Pack attachment was the best invention Actuality just receive my phone last Friday Was up til 2am Saturday morning wphone There are great features and modular for this phone even turning phone into a movie projector and to use camera you just turn twist YOUR wrist back snd forth  w phone in that hand My MOTO Z DROID WOW ME You really have to experience the connection Of Love everything about it  Best Android phone I have owned This is a great phone Very slim very well built Comparable to iPhone 6s Plus in build quality Great screen Manageable battery life considering the size of the battery and the size of the phone Would recommend Moto Mods would fantastically attesting to included backp late JBL speaker and Tumi charger  Although i have had this for a week I love it
Like my last Droid it is very easy to use and it has a nice big screen
Very user friendly Ive been using now for a few days  The volume is not loud enough and when I make or answer a call there is a long pause before Im connected  It does not have as good features as the LG and the camera does not have good share options I love the phone and all the options and Mods But battery is weak and doesnt last more than half a day and I do not use the phone much Have you charge it twice a day My Droid turbo was better I got the Moto z about a week ago now I love the device but hate how much trouble I am having finding a charger aside from the FAR OVER PRICED ones at the Verizon store I cant seem to find one locally so its order one online or wait It cannot be left understated just how premium and beautiful this phone is

I have used Motorola products since the first ever Razr I had every keyboarded Droid and all 3 Moto X devices This lives up to the legacy of those devices and then some 

Best performance and smoothest animations I have seen on any smartphone to date The Moto Z is incredibly thin so even when you have mods attached its no thicker than most other phones on the market

The battery lasts surprising long despite being so comparatively small on the regular Z

The mods have been very useful so far as well The JBL mod is loud and clear and has its own battery so it doesnt drain the phone The power packs are probably the most useful so farIt keeps the phone juiced up all day to where its still sitting around 80 after more than 14 hours Thats with fairly heavy usage too And the Kate Spade power pack is utterly gorgeous too Received the phone friday activated it saturday screen shattered sunday Then this is the review for you I upgraded from the Samsung S6 edge and Im very happy I did The droid force seems to have a little bit stronger antenna as indicated by the signal bar and hangs onto the 4g signal longer Moto version of Android is a lot smoother and has less bloat than Samsungs Android but Samsung has more customization options on the home screen 

Battery life on the Moto is good enough to last all day and the turbo charging system is good enough to give you about a 20 percent boost or more in 15 minutes If there is a Moto mod attached and the phone is plugged in it will charge the phone and mod at the same time Camera quality is great and very quick to launch

Moto mods work very well The phone comes with a dark wood looking back cover and is held on with magnets If you get a case the back cover has to be removed in order to fit I got the JBL speakers with the phone and they work great Just pull the back cover off and pop the selected mod on The only thing I dont like is some of the mods are quite expensive I swap devices often so I have been through many many phones and I can safely say that even though I have owned this phone only a few days it has risen to one of my all time favorites The build quality of this device is on point Its feel in the hand is just as nice as its looks And when they say this phone is thin THEY MEAN IT Even though it is crazy slim I do not feel like this is a device I would easily crush or bend 

Not only is this device beautiful its software is near perfect too LenovoMotorola did a great job of not adding in senseless apps that Google had already created with Android I dont need to worry about choosing between Motorolas calendar app and Googles calendar app because there is only one Same with the calculator and the web browser and so on Its a fresh clean Android device with no heavy skins on the software like some other manufacturers

And finally the innovation of this device is so nice Its modular system is fantastic It really shows how adaptable and flexible an Android device can be I am sorry to see so few Moto Mods out so far but I can tell you that the ones that are out work GREAT And with Motorolas Modular Development Kit I cannot wait to see what other people can come up with I traded up from a LG G3 horrible phone btw and I have been so pleased with my new phone The Mods work seamlessly and hot swapping batteries is a thing of the past It does come with one back panel  I cant wait to get more and I got the JBL speaker and the Incipio battery pack 

The phone itself is blazing fast and when I speed tested it against a S7 it actually preformed better just by a hair though The battery is a little small but the extra battery pack makes up for that The Speakers are crazy loud for how small they are and this phone is incredibly thin

My only issue with the phone is that if you put a case on your phone you cannot use the mods without taking your case off Going to see how that plays out for me but I have never broken a phone yet cross my fingers and toes I didnt curse myself there LOL I just got the phone and im ready to take back The This seems to be a excellent device I traded my s7 edge for it While I will miss Samsung pay using the mods is a plus for me I got the battery mod myself and I must admit it is very well done Much better then the G5 The device is lag free Has expandable storage Feels great and very well built Very happy so far with this device To of the line Android My favorite phone or right now The price is a little high The mods are cool excited for the future
